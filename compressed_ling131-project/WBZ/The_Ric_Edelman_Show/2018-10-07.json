[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAre joining me today on the record holding show we've been talking about twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement [noise]\nThey were so spooked by two thousand eight\nThey'd lost so much money so rapidly that scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year because that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing\nOnly ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were in two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were and\nAlmost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\n\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand eight and only forty one percent say they feel fully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history\nWith the stock market tripling and values since the steps of two thousand nine the majority of Americans still say\nThat they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem\nAnd just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials said they believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that's simply true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\nIt you can open an account with the dollar not a thousand not ten thousand I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that\nBefore you joined your retirement planning worker before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore to build investments\nAnd oh by the way\nA lot of parents are are not saving a lot either it's not just the millennials but the millennials parents that aren't saving a lot and you know one big reason for that I'm going to tell you what it is that parents are spending five hundred billion dollars on every single\nYear and no it's not their kids who are on the playground K. through twelve ... it's not raising children that ... that parents are spending a lot of money on it something else which is preventing them from saving and investing\nGuess what they're spending that money on according to a new study by age wave parents are spending five hundred billion dollars a year\nUnder Eighteen to thirty four year old children\nThey're spending on their adult kids twice as much as what they are contributing to their retirement accounts two thirds of parents say they have to sacrifice their own financial security for the sake of their children who were in their twenties and thirties\nSeventy three percent said that they factor their finances into the decision of becoming a parent in the Nineteen eighties only thirty three percent of people in their twenties and thirties did that the average cost of raising a child today is now about a quarter of a million dollars\nNine out of ten parents say they're surprised at how much money they spent by becoming a parent\nAnd nearly two thirds say they encounter financial difficulties associated with parenting\nEven children who are living independently are receiving financial support from their parents parents are contributing to school costs health insurance rent car expenses parents or even paying for food and for cell phone service for their adult children\nThe numbers are rather astonishing\nThirty one percent of Americans who were ages Eighteen to thirty four thirty one percent we're talking basically one at a free of people in their twenties and thirties or living with their parents we actually have more people who in their twenties and thirties living with their parents than living with a spouse\nThat something new and different for the society\nParents are saying they're not going to be off the hook anytime soon fifty nine percent say they expect to help pay for their children's weddings okay nothing new about that mom and dad have been paying for their daughters weddings for pretty much forever but twenty six percent say they're expecting to contribute to their children's first tones\nThirty three percent expect to contribute to their grandchildren's college costs so it's not just your pain for the wedding for the kid you're paying for the house you're paying for their kids' education as well\nAnd here's what's really shocking an amazing about this the reason the parents are providing so much financial support to their kids is because the kids are unable to handle this on their own independently maybe it's because kids didn't grow up with any financial education they are financially illiterate\nAnd yet about sixty percent of parents say that they taught their children the benefits of investing a really\nSolo why sea island has risen to Seventeen hundred and sixty three with more than five thousand feared

B. news radio [laughter] [noise]\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the wrist that'll show off the Charlotte Hi Marilyn chefs on the phone welcome to the program Chet how are you [noise]\nI Am great Rick thank you very much how can I read several your books and uh watch listen to your show for years\nAnd I guess my question is now that I'm Seventy three have been taken this are empty requirement or how should I take that I've been taking at an annual basis in December should it be taken a monthly yearly a percentage or I kind of like a a thought of a reverse\nDollar cost averaging method\nThat's exactly what you're doing that's exactly right so let me back up and let everybody know what we're talking about here if you have a retirement account such as an IRA or a retirement account at work like a four O. one K. or for three baby or the first savings plan has a federal employee if you have any kind of these retirement accounts\nStarting at age Seventy and a half you have to begin making withdrawals out of the account\nNow the rules are very complicated in technical in terms of when you have to start\nA and how much you have to withdraw and which account you must make withdrawals from if you don't follow the rules very carefully you could not only in her taxes but you also encourage penalties of as much as fifty percent\nOf what you were supposed to have withdrawn but didn't so you've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distributions the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw and it's required hence the name are empty required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice you can take\nThe money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it\nProvided you do\nIt consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said you were doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging in reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life\nIf you want her to do it on a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the accounts of the time what I'm more concerned\nAbout is not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ths with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name another IRA and her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts but\nWe separately care if any of those accounts were\nFor a one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper accounts\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw\nThis is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money once every month the IRS doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the account on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary causing you to pay taxes unnecessarily so the calculations are complicated\nHow much you're going to save for retirement I'm going to say for college how much you're going to save for say home buying or buying a boat or whatever it is you want to save for you tell me how much money you're going to save and in fact more importantly you go ahead and do that once you're saving enough money to achieve your goals\nI don't really care how you spend the rest of your money it doesn't matter anymore\nBecause you've already saved in other words pay yourself first ... once you save money\nYou can then spent all the rest of your money and don't worry if you run out of it did you ever noticed that you run out of money the end of the ...\nThe problem is you run out of money before you've saved for your future so if you treat yourself as a bill if you treat yourself as a creditor you must pay by participating in their retirement plan at work or saving a mutual fund or who knows what then\nThe rest of it goes away and the need for budgeting disappears it's as simple as that know by the way to him\nWhat you've been doing has been working for you\nGreat keep on doing it my concern is that people are engaged in behaviors that aren't working and all they do is feel badly that they are not sticking to their budget or that they haven't been able to show the discipline to do what they need to do\nAs you listen to the advice and information

amount of money to finance their spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties and how it's\nImpacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going\nTo be able to accumulate enough money on their own there's another survey that shows the reversal of this that it's going back up line sixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior\nEven sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire so in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even those sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement sixty nine percent of teenagers say they know little or nothing about financial planning well\nActually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security well that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you first of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem teenagers in fact\nAs we pointed out earlier on the program today\nThey know very little about personal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you this is just a one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire oh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs they don't understand how expensive car czar or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad\nYou haven't told them a ... thing so my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenager sit along side you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook letting them participate\nIn games with them when you send me go talking about investments include them in the conversation your kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou

I therefore don't have to say for my future wrong don't assume your employer\nWill honor its obligations don't assume you'll get as much money as they are promising don't assume you'll get money for as long as they're promising you need to save for retirement as though the pension doesn't exist fabulous great if you do end up getting the pension good for you nobody ever yelled at me because they ended up saving too much money you know what I'm saying so\nBe careful it's really the simple answer whether you worked for a state or local government what do you work for a union dare I even say you work for the federal government you need to assume\nThat these entities will struggle to meet their financial obligations obligations they took\nDecades ago under a very different economic environment in this nation a very different workplace environment than we have today\nAre and if you have questions about your pension if you have questions about when to start your pension if you're being

often talk about the Social Security trust fund and the fact that it's slowly being depleted so someone say not so slowly\nOver the next ten to twelve years it's going to be wiped out that trust fund is at risk of being completely depleted dope has talked about all this and more importantly what's going on in the retirement security marketplace and what does the field of behavioral finance got to do with all this I'm happy to bring on to the program Brigitte ...\nWho's a professor of public policy in corporate management at Harvard University she's also Dina Brigham Young University of Maryland School of business Bridget thank you so much for joining us on the program it's my pleasure to be here\nSo bridges also retirement commissioner of the bipartisan Policy Center she got her PHD in economics from MIT and it's a two time recipient of the ... award for scholarly research on lifelong financial security\nSo you're one of those experts that people like me love ... love to talk about all the time so let me start with a little quiz you're you're going to know the answer to this but I Want to see how well our listeners do in this cute little quiz you're ready for this I'm ready\nSo if I were to give you a penny or a woman ten chance to win ten cents which would you choose the penny\nOr the one in ten chance to win a dime\nMe I Would pick the one in ten chance to win a dime\nYeah I I think most of our listeners will agree with you on that now let me change the question will hear a little bit let's say I were to give you ten million dollars for a woman ten chance to get a hundred million now which would you pick\nNow I'd pick the ten million for sure\nAnd I think most folks would agree with you on that but here's the fascinating thing and of course you realize this in both cases the chances of success or one in ten they haven't changed and since the one in ten hasn't changed your answer shouldn't have changed either\nClassic economics says the both should result in the same attitude but you've demonstrated a very different attitude between the penny versus the ten million dollars and that's the core of behavioral economics isn't it\nYeah that's exactly the court now next that uh the psychology with which we approach financial decision making often result in different answers that if we were to be purely rational logical and consistent with all of the financial choices we make\nAnd the crazy thing is that Richard Thaler won the Nobel Prize last year for his work and behavioral finance and also there was a Nobel one and two thousand two on the same subject but what took so long for the field of economics to figure this out\nThe fact that humans don't act rationally the markets aren't rational because humans are emotional creatures what took so long for everybody to figure that out why is it only just now finally becoming part of public policy\nThe interesting thing is if you go back and read Adams met his often cited as the father of modern economics you as\nA you know writing back in the Seventeen hundreds or he very much a behavioral economist in the Nineteen thirties and an attempt to to be taken more seriously a as a as a science kind of started using mathematical model with people being rational\nSo it's only been I you know more recently that has caused economists to to rethink their model of how people do make decisions as to ... to as opposed to how maybe they should make decisions\nGive me one example of how that's translated into the marketplace affecting ordinary folks\nAh companies are now moving towards automatic enrollment you're automatically enrolled in a savings plan unless you opt out the U.S is encouraging that um other countries that have gone and you know a step further so the u._k. several\nYears ago a rolled out of pension for reform and they are requiring employers to use automatic enrollment and they've seen the fraction of their workforce that's participating in a retirement savings plan increase by more than twenty five percentage points and the span of four or five years\nAnd in fact I was truly does the same thing they have a nine and a half percent mandatory were contribution for their retirement savings for every employee in the country and so their savings compared to other nations is huge and these theories of personal finance improve how we think about Social Security and the challenges it's facing\nI think they can sell a one interesting feature of Social Security is that you can start claiming it as early as age sixty two ah but if you wait and start claiming the benefits later your monthly check will be higher\nUm and that creates an incentive a financial incentive to delay claiming but if you can get people to start thinking of that reason why it might be beneficial for them to delay claiming Social Security ... a later age you can get people to\nUh you know move away from the mindset of oh it's available at a ticket right away\nThis is a bit of a challenge I remember reading studies where they put a five year old and a room with a candy bar\nAnd they say that the child if you don't eat the candy bar now later we'll give you two almost every kid takes the candy bar immediately the notion of delayed gratification is really difficult to overcome compared to our desire for immediate gratification so when you said or retiree\nHow

reading an awesome book I read a lot of\nA technological uh books and I read a lot of early American history books and uh and the book I just finished it's called the butchering art\nIt's the biography of Joseph Lister this was the guy who a physician surgeon actually who figured out that Germans exist and it's because of infections\nThat surgical patients were dying in the Eighteen hundreds\nAnd it's a fascinating story of the history of medicine as we began to learn about a quarter form the ability to give patients anesthesia are recognizing that we can combat germs um\nIn fact Listerine is named after just lister anyway I Want to read you this very short to paragraph excerpt from the book to give you a contrast of medicine in the Eighteen hundreds\nCompared to today quote the injuries and afflictions that surgeons dealt with were as varied as London's population itself\nThousands of workers migrated to the city each year not only with these people living in filth due to the shortage of housing brought on by such rapid urbanization but their jobs were both physically demanding and hazardous\nA hospital awards were clog with people who have been named blinded
