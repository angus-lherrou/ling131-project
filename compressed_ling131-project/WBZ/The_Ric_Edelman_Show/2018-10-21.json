B. news radio and [noise]\nIt's the Rick Edelman show we're talking about the performance of a diversified portfolio this year and the need to remember\nThe long term focus some investors are tempted to try to pick the right investment at the right time but how do you know how to pick the right one\nDo you think you could pick the fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since ... such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year\nGood for you five hundred and Ninety of them in twenty twelve\nOf those five hundred Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen hundred and forty\nSo off the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe of Stockton mutual funds of the ... of them that exist\nOver the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nCBS and the five hundred every year for five years in a row one\nOut of thousands do you think you can pick the funds that are going to outperform the market\nI don't think so what we do is provide passive investment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the returns of the market minus fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes in inflation so that your money is earning a competitive rate of return which shouldn't be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo if you picked and above average fund a fund that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe you lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any kind of [laughter]\nHey you know hey I mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets and that's the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term financial goals and objectives are met and to that end I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans\nForty percent are facing poverty in\nRetirement forty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are going to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return\nIt's not buying a lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick\nJoining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot in the void and what's not that's not the key to achieving your long term financial goals our goal here for you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving and the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell

investment fund in Texas with defrauding investments they made false promises of massive returns in cannabis related businesses\nThe FCC says green view investment partners and its founder Michael Cohn\nUsed misleading marketing materials to raise over three million dollars from investors\nThe guy hired sales people to make cold calls were promising twenty four percent annual returns and guess what\nThe guy used an alias to hide prior criminal convictions he lied about having a former agent from the DEA on staff and he lied about having a long term record of profitability by investing in cannabis related businesses\nThe guy in fact actually has no track record the company sold investment of four hundred thousand dollars has yet to produce the single nickel in profits and the guy I guess what you spend investors money on designer clothing and luxury cars yeah somebody got high\nBut it wasn't the investors in fact the only question you can ask the investors about making the restaurant was already on drugs stay away from high fashion sales pitch is based on getting high with investments\nWere taking telephone calls here on the record on the show had not the Dana Point California Bob you're on the air how you doing\nA ... a question or a is actually a market neutral ones my wife or a retired we're in her sixties uh you know I'm a little I Would say I would say not nervous\nBut uh uh uh just concerned about preserving by uh uh what I've accumulated and I started researching these so called war neutral on the four of you know a portion of my portfolio I Would say\nAnd I guess I just wanted to know what your take is on them\nYeah yeah I appreciate the question about\nThe whole name is ... ... of a sales pitch it clearly is titled in a way to appeal to someone who\nAfraid of losing money in the market and therefore they pronounced themselves as market troll ... one of them or if there's not supposed to mean and the first place\nA market neutral fund is by its sales pitch suggesting that they're going to generate a neutrality meaning that if the market goes down there are not going to suffer losses it's going to be neutral\nThat's the stick that's a sales pitch no one has ever been able to really deliver on that kind of a promise a and there's no reason to expect that they're going to be able to deliver on it in the future\nSo rather than trying to choose a sales pitch that his so called market neutral well we would simply opt for instead is diversification\nIn other words don't put all of your money into stocks have some of your money there to give you some opportunity to keep pace with the cost of living but don't put all of your money there instead have some of your money and bonds and you have some of your money under the mattress having some of your money in cash\nA does make perfect sense we don't have all of our money in any one place but having a little bit of our money in lots of places makes sense so not just stocks but also bombs in foreign securities and government security is an oil and gas and real estate in exponential technologies\nAnd on and on and on so that is what we have found to be the best approach or effectively frozen another way it's not the best approach\nIt's the least worst approach um because what we have really found it's kinda like democracy right the worst political system ever devised except for all the others and it's similar to the same thing we don't know what is\nBest way to invest so we choose the least worst which is not making big bats so if you'll simply place a little bit of your money in a large array of investment opportunities you can help insulate yourself\nFrom losing a lot of money at any one time in any one asset class because you don't have all their money in any one after class so that makes sense for it\nThey said yes totally makes sense and uh you know thank you for talking the out of it uh because it didn't make sense to the\nMany time you come upon other similar kinds of questions just give us a call happy to help\nThanks so much you're very welcome that Bob from Dana Point California here on the record all been show you can do
