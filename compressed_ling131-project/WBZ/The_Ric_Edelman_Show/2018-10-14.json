market\nBecause the more diversified my portfolio is no worse it's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else\nOf course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really glad I don't have all of my money and the stock market boy I'm really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given asset classes performing well and even

trees\nIs ... ... it was raining and so [noise]\nIt's the Rick Edelman show even talking about the need to keep perspective in markets in days like these and we've been talking about gee for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America\nAnd one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty\nPercent over the past year GE he was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year wow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the U.S and the five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date through Tuesday\nRanked at the four hundred Ninety six best stock yeah out of the five hundred that came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than gee\nYou're the date but as of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\n\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things that have been happening in that company but suddenly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else gee did fabulous and became the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next because you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't just the G anyone from among the worst to the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the death filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the S. and P. five hundred were advanced micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best\nTo for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just a suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not in and of itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other nor should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still hunting along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing stopped watching them lose\nIt doesn't mean you should change your investments that means you should change much at all that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today there is something that I think you do want to do and I'm Talking to you gentleman who are listening to the program right now\nYou know it it's really fascinating people are fixated on what's happening in the stock market this past week due to the volatility of the markets what you really need to be paying attention to is what's going on in the bond market according to the Bloomberg Barclays multi verse index this is an index of\nAll bonds all around the world they fell in value by about a trillion dollars this past week [noise]\nA trillion dollars why because the fed is raising interest rates as\nInterest rates go up the value of bonds goes down so here's what I find rather ironic I'm almost comical people who are upset about the stock market saying oh my goodness I'm fearful of losing money in stocks I think I'll run the bonds for safety only to have their money go down in the bond market because rising rates are causing bond values to fall\nBack to work tomorrow mostly cloudy with scattered showers highest sixty three Tuesday and

heading out to Troy, Michigan holes on the line you know involved [noise]\nAnd my question is about the\nOption of taking a a lump sum pension reform and given the opportunity to take on it and wanted your input on it\nUh the question is whether you take the lump sum\nA or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter] so that's a yeah it's like there's no reduced though do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks\nThe good news is this it is\nStraight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis versus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective uh more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great or stretching our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases this year they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where were the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually them are clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions of a fixed amount\nWhatever they are giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise with the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or a partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nAh so that's a consideration ah that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you\nWhereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce it you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given a lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my meaning so you have to know your salary you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manage it permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nIraq is just make more prone to answer a question about terrorists we're hearing a lot about additional tear thing apply to all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase in prices for\nA number of the products that we can see Mars purchase my question is where does all that Tara money go as it goes straight to the government coffers as is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah Mick uh the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S\nAnd it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service instead so yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers um\nIt's really that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and are there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it is receiving this helps to solve that problem\nBut uh the burden is paid by American consumers

A. dot com\nBubble he really it was raining and\nYou're listening to work out on the show we talk a lot here on the program of coming Social Security crisis in court and said we'd get Congress to take action now to help us\nFurther this conversation I'm very excited to bring on the program Alicia Munnell shoes the Peter after ... professor of management sciences at Boston College is terrible school of management and more to my heart she's the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research that might not sound like a big deal you but in our circles in the financial planning world\nThe Boston College Center for Retirement Research produces some of the most important data are useful in the financial planning world so which I'm really excited to have you with us on the program today\nOh I'm delighted to be here and I like your endorsement\nAlicia is a a former member of the president's council of economic advisor she was former assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy um so how is the retirement outlook these days for today's workers\nIt it's not good Rick I'm we calculate an index it shows about fifty percent of today's working how falls are not going to be able to maintain their standard of living once I stop working\nWell that's not very exciting and ... is the situation been this way for a long time or has the landscape changed in recent decades\nUm the landscape has changed a lot in recent decades has gotten a particularly a worst since the financial crisis\nMean to some stew though may\nWhy what we should ask why we lost a lot of money in two thousand eight and a lot of house values and those items haven't totally returned\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dallas pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it and yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nSo that's a sharp and the stock market the people hold stocks or the people in the high income so if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have um their stock values have gained in\nTheir stocks have gained it value but for the bottom two thirds of households they really don't hold very much stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our our most recent data trick two thousand sixteen and hadn't quite gotten back to the off\nPeak of the bubble a by two thousand sixteen but the house values are really high on the coach as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even high in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day in our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks and oh seven had they held through today there'd be a lot better off\nThe first factors you pointed out as most people didn't own stocks at all second those many of those who did hold stocks and those southern panicked and nine sold at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time there are ... are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later they haven't\nEnjoy the run up in value because they didn't hold onto their investments are having continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat that's right and it's and it's a lot of people lost their jobs ... uh two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded that they withdraw the money the level of marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and it has a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves that they won't outlive as one key working longer the longer you work", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "14"}
