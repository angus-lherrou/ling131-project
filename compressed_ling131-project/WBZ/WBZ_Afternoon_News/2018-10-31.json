president is is making this big push on all the all these rallies over the next week here every battleground state we'd been to every one of these candidates have gauge what their line is on the president all of this one way or the other is as a referendum on him\nYeah he's not on the ballot jet but he is on voters' minds and across the battleground states we see borders telling us that they say see their vote as either in support up or in opposition to the president and that could reach historic levels this year not typically in midterms voter say that the president is a factor\nBut we're seeing those levels now go up by double digits in maybe fitting for a divided country is just as many who say it's to support him than to oppose\nAnd we've seen that in every state we've been through here or he's talking all immigration immigration integration Democrats the focus is on health care\nYeah because in all the states that we've poll voters are saying that they think the Democrats would protect preexisting conditions more so than they think the Republicans would do that by wide margins so it's probably no accident the Democrats are focusing on that that they're running it and all of their ads\nYou know the question is whether they're going to be able to run against a good economy which is also something that's helping the Republicans\nYeah that's the issue here so it's the economy versus the direction the country is headed ... what are you seeing in a\nBig split you know we see many people saying that the economy is good but they're not all voting on that more people are voting on the direction of the country and right now the Democrats are trying to take advantage of that okay\nAnthony uh we'll see you next Tuesday but I mentioned before then as
