T. M. a uniform transfer to minors act\nUT amazing account that simply says you're going to set the money aside for your daughter\nAnd uh the problem with it\nIs number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child\nAnd instead of using the money for college she might use the money to buy a Corvette so for that reason especially since you're targeting this for college we might instead recommend a five twenty nine college savings plans which are available and all states all around the country and in this way\nYou own the account not your daughter your daughters the beneficiary of the account\nBut you control it you determine how the money's invested you decide when the money is withdrawn for college and if you indeed use the money for college than the withdrawals are completely tax free no taxes at all it's fabulous\nAnd that's why the five twenty nine plan is the preferred way to save for college because you can use the money to any college in the country for any college expenses tuition room board books pretty much everything except travel\nOr if you don't use the money for college them withdrawals will be subject to taxes ... percent penalty but you could always transfer the money to another child if you've ever have another one or two cousins of your daughter you could even leave the money there for your daughter's children and another Thirty years\nSo lots of fabulous flexibility associated with the five twenty nine plan so that's what we'd recommend it to five twenty nine plan targeted for your daughter\nMoron sitting for college next on the record all been show called us a triple a plan wrecked you can even schedule a call [noise] look for the red button not our homepage at ... dot com [noise]\nWith the author of the number one\nNational bestseller the truth about retirement plans and IRA coming up on direct Edelman\nCattle you need time eleven fifty three at the same go if you don't like the weather here in New England just wait a minute and we did and now there is plenty of beautiful sunshine after a very dark and cloudy Sunday morning\nLike I said how can you can check your ride with a super retailers have New England all wheel drive traffic on a three year state attorney but enough to\nHave seen out west certainly gotten much busier mass pike west bounce laws by the west both service plaza further west bound gets heavy for about a mile and a half from one forty six in ... crashed before route to Ninety an Auburn it clears briefly then you're back nearly seven miles from shopping and disturbed which\nDo not east bound work who by mainstream should read causing some ... to Ninety west bound other work who causing about a mile and a half backup before church street in North where I'm going up north up around one twenty eight cellphone slow from landfill down pat sale on the street and again from after north after the globally through three southbound busy connecting one twenty eight and Burlington route one in four Ninety five troubled free\nIn a ... report twelve o three on WB these tropical countries\nBuying or selling a home think hiring real estate in ... in Christopher ...
