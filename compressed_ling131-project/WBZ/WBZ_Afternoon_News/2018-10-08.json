going around\nBecause that's a hoax that a lot of people including some very smart people who I follow\nHave shared and my recommendation is that you don't pass it on and you don't tell people your account with cloning but if you have really solid evidence could have been because there are cases I I had a friend actually a former\nRetired US Senator who started the weird messages a couple of years ago and then we looked into it and it turned out he had been clone so\nIt can happen but these particular messages that are floating around her fulfill aren't\nHow can somebody uh bought or some uh bad actor clone my Facebook account\nActually it's pretty easy I Would have to do is go to your account grab from pictures which are easy to do and then create account with the training and your friends but I think it's because there are many people even my name's Larry Magid which is a relatively rare name I could think of\nSeveral people who have the same name and they could be on Facebook and they would not be in about it through because at the same name well\nThat's why it's possible for somebody to come up with a name exactly like you're not\nA cut off any alarms but if you see somebody who has her name but for example would I Do appear to search for my name and I look and then if I look at that account and I see pictures of me that I Know it's a clone by the picture

false alarms\nHow does that happen how can somebody uh bought or some uh bad actor clone my Facebook account\nActually it's pretty easy I Would have to do it go to your account grab some pictures which are easy to do and then create account with the same name and your friends think it's because there are many people even my name's Larry Magid which is a relatively rare name I could think of\nSeveral people who have the same name and they could be on Facebook and they would not be an umpire through because at the same name well\nThat's why it's possible for somebody to come up with a
