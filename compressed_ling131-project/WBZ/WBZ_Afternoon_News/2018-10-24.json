global mail here to CNN's offices and being tested and that all the devices were simply made but functional and could have been lethal jak\nOr Nicky thanks very much we're gonna move now to search for the person or persons behind these attacks ... has more on this\nMultiple law enforcement sources say one of the bombs consisted of PVC tubing and used a digital clock connected to a small battery as a possible trigger device by rote technique powder was the explosive\nAnd in order to keep it light weight glass was used as shrapnel investigators think whoever put the device together was trying to keep the weight down so that it could be put in a mailbox without having to appear at a post office or mailing Ron hospital was a former assistant director of the FBI or does it say that they didn't explode\nWell let me say that that they were intercepted prior to their ability to explode may say that they were never capable of exploding even though they may have had black powder in them\nSo six packages oh consisting of a large manila envelope with six American for rubber flags stands will now be analyzed the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia\nInvestigators we'll deconstruct them looking to trace the origin of the wiring and the other components to see where and when they may have been purchased and buy me on the package itself\nSo it looked for fingerprints and potentially the

appear different towns and sort of his homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush she's now senior national security analyst for CBS News they knew what they were doing enough to make a bomb friend but certainly not in a very sophisticated way\nThat's right and what we're hearing from law enforcement is it the crude device it would have been lethal if opening detonated but it's not a standard recipe and so what we're hearing from law enforcement sources and this is an individual they didn't go on the Internet and just pull down a standard of al ... which we think before\nSo he's left his own signature right there is something unique about the way this has been put together which will burying the lead very helpful to investigate\nThe notion that it's TV not metal and so potentially could get through a metal detector is is a little frightening\nThat's right this is somebody who was thought about it he ... and that's also the reason you have all the return addresses being Debbie Wasserman Schultz to all these democratic leaders\nThinking that perhaps it wouldn't be screened because it was ... or they would have expected something of interest in that case like that I Do I think there'll be lots of breaks this is somebody who's made plenty of mistakes the wrong address to Eric Holder misspelling John Brennan named John Brennan doesn't work at CNN he works and NBC until this is somebody who's made plenty\nThe stakes along the way all the outside packages are identical thick thick stamps to tears ... printed label this is somebody who's who's likely left a lot of\nOdd but still scary yeah Brett Townsend thank you very much be these attempted attacks come as the president and his most prominent critics have been engaged in a brutal war of words before the election that has brought continue calls to dial down the volume from the top down we just genius in Wisconsin\nVery clear sense an interim today called unity it acts\nOr threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nBut in the past his real some of her she insulted the same people\nUnderstand the letter bombs the legendary Maxine\nWaters I have no confidence and a guy like Brennan Hillary broken", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WBZ Afternoon News", "city": "Boston", "day": "24"}
