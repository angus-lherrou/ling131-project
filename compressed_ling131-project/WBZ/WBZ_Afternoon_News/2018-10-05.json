with traffic on the three's\nAre in and of course the Columbus Day forecast as well\nWell now the road to confirmation it appears the votes are there to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh in a vote on the Senate floor on Saturday with Susan Collins now saying Mr President I Will vote to confirm\nAnd democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia broke his party ranks today and said just a little while ago he will vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nActivists didn't waste any time confronting senator Manchin on Capitol Hill\nBut\nThey are\nChanting shame the word shame their mentioned announcing his decision seconds after senator Collins said she would vote to confirm so pleased to be joined by devil BBC TV political analyst John Keller are you surprised John\n[noise] no not really a the conservative base that\nMansion and Collins or feel they have to appeal to modify that made it clear over the last week to ten days that they would not tolerate a abdication from the party line and colleagues its cage and mention of course running and the strongest pro\nTrump state in the union and facing a typical reelection these politicians did what they felt they needed to survive now that's going to make them anathema\nTo voters who want them to act on principle here those anti Kavanaugh activists well they made a calculation about what they can survive and what they asked and they've got to have to live with it\nJohn ... and just reading a tweet from President Obama's national security ambassadors event Susan Rice she said who wants to run for Senate in Maine and with a one word reply me so it's already shaping up she just your thoughts on that\nWell I Believe it's two years away for Collins that a lot that's a long long time in politics a month is a long time in politics and that's how long we have until the mid term elections however those elections\nAre going to be in part a referendum on all of this and who is madder than whom it more likely to turn out to the polls and the outcome of those mid term elections\nGoing to send a message either of of firming this decision by these politicians to vote for capital or sending them a message that you just stepped on a big political banana peel\nSo Alaska's Murkowski is the sole hold out of the Republican Party who said she vote no I I we know with certainty now the votes aren't there barring any weird

it's a big deal to\nA a a that this happened to the Supreme Court\nBut a Murkowski is a good example of how politicians in the end or a function of their constituencies uh Alaska politics is very different from Maine or West Virginia and Murkowski a and Alaskans have a very independence streak that sort of issues partisanship in many cases\nSo she did what she did they did what they did\nIn the end I think what what has also have to look in the mirror\nAbout what message just they're sending to their political leaders everybody is going to be looking in the mirror after November sick so I can assure you that boy\nAll right John Keller thank you good to talk to you and have a great holiday\nWeekend you've earned it onto the roads right now where people are just trudging along on the
