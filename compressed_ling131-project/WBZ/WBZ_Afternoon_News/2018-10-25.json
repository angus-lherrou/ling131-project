come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange route a place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable like a flag down a cop call nine one one or ... toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight\nNew York city safe and that is for anything new or someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York we don't underestimate the difference even one person can make\nGeorge our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as I Do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision that can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nNew York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second it on every day they are not just this week our detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the threat stream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city has made it\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution I'll tell you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today\nI have a men's pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD to each and every day\nEspecially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today all concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the publicly serves safe\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city will make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor\nJames O'Neill and leaves leads to listen to express my appreciation to all the men and women and why pi de ... who have done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on the media outlets an attack on the prominence of public figures\nOr going to make sure there's expanded the presence as long as we needed to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending people who are coming under attack that part of how we protect the Democratic process\nIs to show the threats like this would not taken lightly so that they expect that presidents and I know that for those who have gone through this in the last few days that's a presence that they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that ah every day New Yorkers have responded to this situation\nWith the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for that makes me very very proud of all eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation\nWith a real sense of resolve or they're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved\nAh the people in this city or are not being thrown off the game are not having their values undermined the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now\nIn the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear a clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been\nWhat changed for them too much division in the air and in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here\nUh first of all helping law enforcement this was something that everyone can do if you have any information at all let you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately uh let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold it back\nSo many times and I agree with the commissioner law enforcement the ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizens step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information\nSharing if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police and get their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation a tone of civility a tone of mutual respect is something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voice is doing we also have to ask questions or all of us treating each other with
