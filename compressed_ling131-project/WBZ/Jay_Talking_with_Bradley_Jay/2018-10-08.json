like this one I had been down in Florida\nIn Claremont Florida I was meeting up with my friend and his wife at a local pub and\nWhen I showed up mind you that I was one hundred percent solver um I just got out of work and uh I had ordered a pitcher Bud Light\nAnd the borrowers packed with berets there was like some college thing in town and all the hotels around we're all parents and\nUh I've got my wife tab\nOn my buddies right shoulder\nAnd I've got my right hand on his wife's lower back in like saying that well and I miss you guys type thing yeah and I'm within about three minutes or so it may get an order and my picture but like I feel somebody touching my aunt [noise] and I mean like\nSeizing my hand when I say touching\nAnd only because I was told her that I grabbed the concept real quick that my friend's wife is very beautiful and there was um six one free forty and there was a guy about six five\nA standing behind my friend's wife a that was rather intoxicated and I grabbed the concept for real quick that he thought he was touching her backside\nInstead he was massaging my hands okay um\nIt got ugly pretty quick I was up but the guy is grill and\nWhat were you in his girl floor for because he was touching me I mean I I\nDid one with the heat and you knew that he was doing it by mistake\nWell I knew that he was trying to grab my friend's wife\nYeah so which is which is which is a crime touch a new or having him think that it was the wife are both\nI say I I think both personally\nSo you're you're ... you're sober and you started yelling at him\nOh yeah it was it was ugly and I was look it up at a I mean there was a big ... and my my body I signed up and move\nAnd my other my peripheral vision off to the left and I turned around and my friend said to me because I have your back and I'm like I can only deal with what's in front of a I Can't worry about what's behind me well what he saw which I did it\nWas the gentleman that I was confronted the bar his friends were standing behind me at the pool table\nAnd they had an screwed the pool sticks and there are passing out pieces because they're ready to jump me from behind so my my buddy was dealing with the guys behind me as I turned back around\nTo deal with the gentleman that really\nOriginally started the confrontation um I saw a\nBig black shadow coming across my pitcher beer so I knew in my mind that the guy was already a swinging\nAnd I knew if I turned around I probably catch it right across the job\nSo back in the early nineties I was in the Army Reserves or when I was a hundred and eighty three pounds and ... my wife and three forty now um but the training kicked dead right away I use it in Twenty years I took a step back\nThe guys\nLeft arm came right by the front of my face I grabbed his wrist I twisted it out and with my right arm by Jim does elbow straight forward as I pulled back with the left arm\nAnd his bones came right through its scan I took the back of his head slammed it off the bar and drop them on the floor and it was like\n... when the white goes on all the roaches runaway um his wife came running up at the bar for the dance floor for singing karaoke and said oh my God you've done it again [laughter] picked him up brought about side put them in a minivan and they laughed well\nThe cop show up at the course in Florida um they come and look at like

Know the owner of the bar and it's got thirty two on the bar alone\nAs soon as they want to check the surveillance cameras you can clearly see that I wasn't even facing this guy once he started swinging so then it's considered self defense\nThey went hotel the hotel\nAnd eventually found where this guy was saying um his wife had come down to the front desk and asked them for a medical kit because her husband and I cut himself shaving so they gave her this little first aid kit like with bad day the\nAnesthetic wipes and are turned out that he needed you know\n\nThree attach attendance

catching\nAnybody regard as community\nIt can get it back again to conclude if\nOh yeah how far away is that from Boston\nAbout eighty five miles\nSo that's kind of do but I could live there right\nUh

and\nStories and and the bars and so on so a little bit of nightlife air a lot of younger people go there at nighttime for entertainment so that's just too mild to hit two or three miles from here\nBut if it is it yeah\nYou know where ... where I grew up in New Hampshire was pretty close to the main border because Rochester in east Rochester New Hampshire kind of border main\nI'd write I never thought of going to mean was never popped up in my mind I never think of Maine I never think of it as an opportunity or an option that's interesting\nWell it's just beautiful day we had a house

through\nA ... I think we still have family and friends there and I'm a Elvis there the USS Constitution you there\nOh you are uh-huh\nWe got a gun and we got to one of the people from coming on soon as it goes\nI Know now they're over there yeah account blocks of let's say they are in a uh it ... it should be one I think she's passed that for the um [noise]\nAnd taken off that thing takes off really exciting landing even landing in your connection like landing in Reykjavik what's exciting it was especially exciting 'cause I was super windy whoa I thought this\nWas coming in hot and it it's a little island with a lot of wind and I was like one of those whoa bank kind of landings\nAnd then take it off and\nLanding at an all new place and then figuring out how to get to where you got to go take the train might\nAs well started a little bit\nOn this trip I I Know I meant I talked about some\nBut Helsinki is fresh clean 'em it's about six hundred thousand people the entire country has about I don't know maybe six million not many\nAnd they've decided that they want a good society than not like Americans who were all about us and like freedom really means me me me me there's they decide\nWe want to have the society we want rules we want we're going to bathe 'em 'cause we like the rules 'cause we made them up\nLike they don't cross the street into the light says they can even if there are no cars coming also you know what they have and you might find this offensive I didn't tell you this before I don't think\nYou cannot just name if you live in Finland you cannot just name your kid anything there's a list you choose from it's a huge list but basically you can't name your kids I'm dumb stuff some would say that's certainly not freedom and you're kind of right it's not\nAbout what it does is something that you conservatives want a lot\nAnd that is a ... everyone's on the same page it's a national identity\nCulture border what is it language that's the ... of conservatives they're into that culture that's the rules that they as a group ... obey\nEven name they don't want some goofy crazy name Bayh won that name consistent with international heritage\nNow\nThat's pretty interesting right you want freedom but you also want culture borders and language in this case ... there's a there's a tug of war there but\nThe education health care free and they're happy another thing their their cities clean\nNot a cigarette but on the sidewalk\nAnd you ... when I came back to Boston and I thought my God what a dumpsters and it really is it's so dirty no uh did not see homeless\nDid not see drug addicts stumbling around\n\nI don't know how they do it you can say well it's because they're small really is that it ... I don't think so I think that they've just decided as a society they want a good society it's rather it's about the group rather than the individual\nNow there may be all kinds of downsides of this living there have loved to and and places like that places like the Scandinavian countries and I'd love to I'm going to actually look it up my left to speak to someone who live there and say\nOkay what's the downside that we use the tourists don't see I Love I Love the ... it's extremely\n\nI'll do is he in freshman claim Helsinki itself was right on the water and the whole archipelago of islands there\nIt's you can ... feel and breathe the salt like it when you're in Boston you barely noticed that you're on the ocean but in Helsinki you totally do [noise]\nAnd fish I'm a big fish person fish fish fish fish fish salmon twice a day for salmon soup\nAnd I mentioned that bright colors are important to them I think because of the year of the it gets dark so long\n... bright colors in the home right paintings bright table like a bright yellow table but I wanted to get into a I didn't talk much about ... ... talk a little about that [noise] remember that\nIt has an ancient history ... ... it was a place of course before it was it was a like part of Sweden and the borders change at all then through a a an agreement with the Russians Russians Russians got it\nAnd it was a Soviet country\nRussian satellites for a long time but\nThe Russians didn't destroy the the middle ages ... and the old city of talent is highly preserved it looks like the fourteen hundreds\nAnd they're very careful to keep it that way there aren't one downside of it is way too many tourists kind of a bummer and but you can get outside of the main area and you can avoid the tourists the air being V. thing\nSo all into that now this is my first ever being the experiences so far I've only stayed I've only stayed in a way you have the whole place to yourself you don't stay with anyone one great thing about it as you can get a two bedroom place you could never afford a two bedroom hotel relief for them but for\nOne hundred and twenty bucks a two bedroom it's hugely spacious\nPlace and then you know like fourteenth century building ... even the shape of the building was weird it had this very steep proof and when you go inside the steps were stone even inside\nAlmost had a disaster how may have told you this it's All right on the last day head back to the uh the ferry\nHave your keys right and using coal you're just leave the keys and the place forgetting that there's a gate there was a locked gate you had to use the keys to get out of so it's OK loud chicken reading okay yeah I got to leave the keys on the table\nLock the front door locked the door downstairs and then you get outside oh no you have to be the ferry and a half an hour and we left our keys on the table and we have to have the keys to carry out\nSo trapped ... locked between the building and the outside kind of why we just made a massive trapped travel mistake kind of missed the ferry that's going to cost fifty bucks and do everything so it just so happened that the\n\nThe ... for different apartments in the place where within reach she reached out through the bars so it was six o'clock in the morning Sunday Morning and I just started hitting hitting buttons hoping somebody would wake up and buzz us out\nThank goodness that would have been a bummer man that would have been major stupid right there and one thing when you travel and you're always it's you're always on the edge of making a dumb mistake seriously like\nIt's so easy to make a damn mistake like the date maybe you buy your ticket for the wrong day buying online that can happen um\nThe times you might make a mistake you might you might be leaving it Fifteen hundred hours but in your mind saying five o'clock you got to keep you going to double check all that stuff\nAnd get get places early\nAnd\nThe well the the finishing up on the air being be giant bang for the buck I don't even understand how hot the whole hotels will stay in business with this\nSpacious cheaper better if you stay one with someone that you meet the person they're all local connection that will help you out with well the ferries over there and the good restaurants over here\nAnd the app is so good the filters on it are great I urge you to try it out don't be freaked out I'll be afraid and folks I Need you to help me out\nSomebody sent me some links to air being be places off the grid high elevation remote in New Hampshire and Vermont that was really great that you sent us please send more Seventy busy\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter]\nI'm born and actually she didn't want to fight for forty four\nVeasey phone\nCaller referred to\nFollow us on Twitter feeds the traffic [noise]\nW.
