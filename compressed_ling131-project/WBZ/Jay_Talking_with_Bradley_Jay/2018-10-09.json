{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBZ", "content": "Okay but but again you you bring some interesting a perspective\nI always try to just be a little more balanced because again it is in in many in some respects a lot of that is based upon an ex boyfriend and thirty six years such a long time\nTo um to remember\nSpecifics but anyway that's what I that's what I think and I agree with you I I'm surprised that others had not mentioned choosing Cowell McConnell yup\nI'm One more thing and that that age she she called her therapist that that it happened in their late teens somehow her that Democrat judiciary staffers change that down to age that team and Nineteen eighty two\nCould we see we haven't seen her therapist no shit Susan have we have well my\nChoices are the ... ah USA Today the Washington Examiner I'd Google away\nOr enough I got all of that but I still I Want to see the therapists notes that's what I'd like to see if we are going to really both reopened it let's see the therapist knows but I don't think she wants to do that are in my opinion\nI think she wants to\nRule out during the week up on that point we agree thanks Susan is on the ... not going to go next to John up in ... John you an extra nice I go to John\nThank you for taking my call 'em I'll give you what you want first I think a winner here and are the Republicans and Donald Trump for making a a a recommendation and slate part the justice to the for being confirmed that was that was good great great great on his behalf but um\nI guess the homeless or is here in my opinion but the Democrats hum and I say that only because they're trying to do I heard a lot of your callers they're trying everything\nThey can to stop Trump in every way possible I Do think this was politically motivated and I it it just ... I I used to be democratic because my parents were\nI've shifted to independent but I'm trending more towards Republican only because of the stuff that the Democrats are going to try to get a Donald Trump out and not supportive of the kinds of that that\nThat we that won the election rightfully it's just it's appalling it makes me it takes away from our country's pride and it's it's an embarrassing to being around Democrats now that I bring up politics all the time now just because they don't\nLike the hypocrisy of Democrats saying that you know they're nice they're friendly and they're all this but yet you know in front of everybody think they do these negative that this whole charade about this justice is is embarrassing to our entire\n... hey John I Hope you'll be listening on Wednesday night we're going to be up at the mess school lower in the end over or come on by and see is that the school of law or from eight to ten we're going to have a conversation with the Republican and democratic candidates for Congress the first time meeting You're welcome is free and open to the public okay\nThat'd be great that would be great thanks ... great show great ... of all your callers will prospect I appreciate it\nI'm sure that they're very very much all points of view welcome let's go to Karen and limits to care and give us when to give us a loser one or both okay\nI'll give you both um well I think unfortunately the winner is on the Republicans and the judge had got confirmed and I'd say the losers are really the leadership of the Democratic party knocking Democrats so much\nAs the grand and interesting distinction that should not have\nThough because the Democrats represented and do things for the people but the leadership if if if corrupt and\nI saw that in twenty sixteen when they didn't have Bernie Sanders you know on TV oh you're in or out enough and they put Hillary Clinton out there when he went for winning almost half the states\nI agree with you totally on all those points very good perspective Karen I guess fool lines going to try to get two or three more a gay thanks I Love your calls as always thank you much\nSix one Seventy five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty actually if we get these three calls and I'll be happy let's try to move quickly read in Delaware haven't heard from reading while Reid next door nights I go right ahead\nBy the biggest winner of course is Trump okay but I think the Senate the Senate as a whole\nBecause when we were kind of ... for the Senate I think that it it looks bad\nOh very interesting perspective just remember you we get would we elect we ... we both Ford is don't we [laughter]\nYeah that's been real quick radio you know come to a lot earlier I didn't get around eight now I can get your quarter governors having dirty\nWell I don't know why why that would be but I think part of it might be because darkness is coming over the landscape earlier read I think that as\nI could come to a lot better than I can get seven thirty now\nWell okay but again I think that's the the function of ah the daylight ending sooner because our C.\nAverage or kill thank you both excellent excellent ... we'll talk soon okay All right good night dangling off\nAnd I miss hearing from you thank you much let me go to Louis in mold and always going to get you in one more in at least go ahead Louis\nHi Dan was so I think the people who have their integrity are always the winners I Would agree\nAnd so um even though Kavanaugh may have won a seat on the Supreme Court you know I'm his integrity and so you know\nSo who to give me your name give me a name or or an institution that is one and only\n... interest can knock you haven't mentioned the second accuser\nBy oh I've made I'd had been mentioned her tonight I'm because she never came forward and testify the focus has been a doctor for you're correct on that\nRight and the reason that that uh the witnesses to her account not investigated or questioned what because there were corroborating witness says\nOkay so so you you want to mention though I I mean\nChristine Blasey Ford and Deborah merits are the winners\nAnd bearing integrity and certainly hello\nGimme gimme quick lose it goes against others didn't want to get in okay go ahead say the biggest\nLoser it's Brett Kavanaugh\nOkay good enough I appreciate that Louis again at the get you an early give you more time to get to more want to try to get in okay\nYep heavy rain I\nDo now we've got we're going to get to more in here I promise day in Maryland Day do you go to be really quick\nQuick short term winter Trump and the Republican Party okay\nBut generally rent in our generation and a half ... and the Republican Party but when you look back in history oh long term the Republican Party\nWere the only way I thought\nI got you thank you much de pre she didn't want to get one more in marketing Indiana marked I give you about ten seconds what are you got give me a winner give me a loser\nGot to be with American cabinet and hurting profits and the biggest regret that would be Dianne Feinstein or not doing this quietly\nWhat's with that I agree with that day smart we're done for the night Bradley's walking in and we got ten seconds left I've already told the world you're going to talk about ... talking about like good or bad light how badly hurt I Do all the dogs or cats thanks Rob all dogs or cats are that's going to have and that's my they'll jolly raised in the past\nEight years ago and probably that's where all your pets or

C. buses WXXI Kay s F ... two men for an eye heart radio station\nUh and I had had a long industrial management career before I came to Carthage and so I was hired they're actually started the country's first program to teach students\nHow to have careers and develop products and businesses\nAnd it's been very very successful my graduates are very successful because they have this preparation I'm and I'm very actively involved in promoting innovation entrepreneurship two scientists around the world done workshops and all sorts of places\nAnd how you concentrate on public science education can you give me some examples of that sure\nUm there's really no need in the country to have people really understand\nHow nature works and how we are connected to it\nAnd to be able to make smart decisions because they understand that\nAnd so uh my biggest effort right now is managing a big program partner from Carthage school I work for the Appalachian mountain club and Dartmouth College Smith College and Stony Brook university are part of our team\nAnd we train undergraduate students in science communication and then we do a whole suite of programs every summer\nAnd I do programs throughout the year\nWhere we try to get people to understand the environment\nBy taking a cosmic perspective to use astronomy to understand how the whole universe works to explain how things work here and why things are the way they are and why we should treat them better so it's a very important program uh we've done programs for over fifty six thousand people already in seven years\nUh we're launching you're eight\nSo you you\nTeach how cosmology and the history of life on earth combine and one big fascinating story that changes the way audiences interact with their environment that in itself is a question what do you mean by that\nSo um people generally gets a broad brush assistant everybody but people generally think that they're more important than everything else that's out there um have rights to take whatever you know resources we won and so on um if you understand\nAll these really amazing things that happen\nFrom cosmology from the beginning of the universe they created this environment the way we have it here well created us also created everything around us\nSo the exact same history that makes humans possible also made chipmunks possible and grass possible and Wales possible um and so if you understand\nAll of these pieces and how they fit together you start rethinking and saying oh wait a minute wait a minute I'm not better than everything else I'm just here for the same set of reasons that everything else is here let's treated better let's not take more than we need let's use what we should use was not try to distort the environment\nAnymore than we have to ... not affect it but really treated much better\nFor example the situation where there are a couple of shark attacks the it seems the human reactions we've got to either kill the seals are the shark so we can go in the water and go swimming I told them the other night\nThat that that's not right no be messing with nature just so we can do whatever we want and going to somebody else some other creatures environment and be feel safe we need to do it if it's not safe to stay out of the water\nExactly I mean it ... the beach was not put there so that we can go swimming it was there as part of this big natural environment so that's a that's a great example of the kind of attitude we'd like people to take okay\nNow gather last scope is part of what you do for the international year of astronomy two thousand nine\nYou and your partner Rick founded Galileo scope yes we did that's pretty cool too yeah I'm so uh\nFor the international year of astronomy which was in two thousand nine and we've continued it through this day including the international year of light and twenty Fifteen or we're looking forward to twenty Nineteen 'cause that's the fiftieth anniversary of the moon landings\nAre so some of us are old enough to remember that but it was a very very big deal in a very exciting thing um but back when we started the program\nWe were looking to be able to give people all over the world the opportunity to look into space and see things uh and of course we're looking at all over the world you can't have an expensive telescope I mean we can afford that\nSo that means is that when you take a look at the map of the United states at night and see the light and how it's changed dramatically over the last ten years that we just don't get the pollination we used to in the United states because it's too bright at night\nThat's right right and again another thing you know bad light it goes a fixable thing and as we fix those things if we can work to fix those things we can help I mean you can think it's just better for the animals but ultimately it's our food\nSobriety right right so put opinion that and\nAnd you said is fixable hook is probably right after the break after the news and the weather will talk a little bit about how that's fixable right right absolutely alright six one Seventy five or ten thirty now I'm going to open it up to you as well\nYou can ask about the light in your house you can ask about your schedule you can ask about anything that we've even touching upon and things we haven't WB\nCBS News updates

Nineteen years old and this is how I live United [noise] I've always been kind of computer geek and I found a way to use those skills to help the homeless in my community\nFor people facing hard times computer skills and in basic resume are so important may seem like a small thing\nBut it makes a huge difference in people's lives so it's United Way created a program\nTogether we go through their own chops history\nResume and then say that I'm a very own Usb drive provide work books and trees [laughter] I even budgeted for cupcake so he can celebrate this class\nOf people get the job that's huge when somebody says hey man that John the only apply for I got a [noise] that's what living United does like to me my name is Dale ... people chief financial independence [noise] so I don't just where the shirt\nGive advocate volunteer living on ... by United Way an ad council\nTo be sure of\nSo here's your weather my friend's fifty five degrees what it was fifty nine last night I thought that was cold and now it's fifty five [noise] I didn't expect that\nOvernight considerable crowd ... said temperatures steady in the mid fifties and during the day morning clubs giving writer sunshine warmer more humid in the afternoon I Seventy seven and I ask\nYou all is this something Holland wise in the air 'cause I'm I'm feeling a little little off they might visit ragweed maybe\nI Seventy seven a Tuesday night partly clarion humid with areas of Fox farming and then Wednesday warm humid sunshine that she cries eighty one see that's not right\n\nOr the you know with all this warm weather the deer ticks are having no more and more north into the White Mountains which is a bummer which is which is where I guess Doug area and live you actually having a a a an observatory up there\nYeah I Do at my home I have a a little building with a roof rolls off so that uh I can use my telescopes anytime I Want in a beautiful sky it's a wonderful\nPoint it's not it's not moosehead like doc up there but it's better exactly exactly and uh so you probably have a pretty cool telescope if you have to roll a roof back to using mhm yeah I mean how cool how ... microscope I mean you're a telescope it it\nIt's pretty killer I build my own and uh this one's a nice ten inch telescope but I've got a couple of other smaller ones in there it's really terrific\nAnd you grind the grass and everything yep mhm I'm coming up to see it All right I Can't wait for you to come as you are right in the heart of you know folks I'm always talking about going into New Hampshire\nDoug lives right exactly where I Want to have my little dream cottage okay we talked about problems for people and animals and food\nPretty much every system are caused by late at night or lack of a dark cycle you see it as a way to fix that ... I mean without just turning off the light\nAbsolutely because this is not a matter of not having quite a bit we need like yeah I'm going I'm going to finish this interview with you know the next hour or two I Need to get back to my hotel if we had the light I I'm not going to make it right we need to be able to have light but the trick is to have the right amount of light\nIn the right place\nAnd not have it in places where we don't need it 'cause that's wasting it ed and creating affects some ... imagine if you're watering your lawn what the sprinkler and you have to spend money for your water you want all the water on your lawn you don't want to be spraying it onto a random places right and yet that's what we do with light if you look at a street light some of that light sitting the road\nBut a lot of that light is flying sideways up into the sky\nSatellites can see light at all that's wasted like that's wasted light it should be dark ... should somehow be reflected back onto\nThe right life should only go down yep and eliminate where you're walking or or traveling and if you do that and you put only as much as you need yeah\nThen we'll minimize the effect on the environment we're not going to eliminate them right eliminating it would mean getting rid of all the light it we can reduce it and we want the right brightness and we want the right color it's the bluish light\nThat has the worst effects blue lights scanners creates a lot of glare creates most of the health effects\nIs this late in his room blew it looks kind of this one's not too bad I was just sort\nOf in between um uh so the yellow where the light the better so for example um we were talking about before having light at night while you're sleeping is a bad thing yeah\nWell sometimes you need to have some light around either you have a very young person who needs some white or an old person who needs yeah you can actually get red LAPD night lights\nThat do not\nThat won't affect adversely affect your sleep pattern exactly and you can have a glow there so if you need to get up and fight or you have a little one is afraid of the ... in the closet\nYeah\nYou can get those easily available men and learning to read lap and plug it in in here that's all right that would that would be a healthier so that's like I Would be like I was asleep\nWould that count for sleep if even if I'm awake no because I didn't actually be a sour right [laughter] you know I was trying to find ways to get some melatonin and that was it good okay so so for example you want to have\nLight fixtures that only send light downward yeah don't spill out beyond the area you need to illuminate orange yellow as possible\nAnd know brighter than you have to have because you don't want to ... reflecting backup yeah we may have us any brighter than you have to because I was just going to bounce off and create glare so if you do that low and behold\nWe can reduce the problem so for example lights on houses you'll see lots of houses which have these very big bright lights around their front door sending lots of white flying I yeah and they think that makes her how safer oh yeah well actually doesn't cause it's creating clay or if you're walking up to your house that whites in your eyes\nYou're not even going to be able to see if somebody's hiding in the bushes studies show that\nStudy showed that feeds prefer brightly lit houses\nAs long as the lights pointing at the house is kind of like some of the shining a flashlight and the occupants eyes\nExactly which does you know good and so you can actually put lights on your house that Ollie sunlight down near your insurance 'cause you need like to be able to put the candle are perfectly reasonable level light yeah\nBut it should only point down on your door and put it on a motion detectors what's on what you needed an off the rest of the time and here's the beautiful thing about it if you make all the lighting changes you save a lot\nOf money I'm going to say sorry to I was just going to say how do you sell us all and you can certainly sounded by saying well we have a lot of money\nAnd you do because wasted light let's put it this way\nYou only need so much light if you're making three or four times as much you're spending three or four times as much as you need yeah\nNeed this beaming down the street light right I mean yeah ... yeah ... you could have those but you know reflect hers are a great thing you could certainly have\nNo small low lights were exits are you know to guide you were exits are in sanctions exits intersections in excess but having street lights or so for example in residential neighborhoods street lights are very bad thing really they're pouring light into people's bedrooms creating health effects\nAnd they're creating glare which actually makes it harder to see when you're driving down the street\nSo you're actually more likely to hit a kid in the street on the other hand\nI mean I as a personally was the situation right outside here mhm they're just construction and the intersection or whatever that highway is outside ... and the whatever roads perpendicular to it I have to walk through it every night and there are no street lights on and I'm feeling I was actually feel like I Would complain about it on the air\nHey guess what is a better solution that right which is to have sidewalk lights okay you can have a ... type fixture the sands about two or three feet up that lights the sidewalk\nI needed a motorist to see me crossing the street they have headlights that is the best thing to see us because it's right at your level is right at your waist\nAnd it's right in front of the car it's the best possible lighting it's the same thing if you're walking down the street with your flashlight\nYou don't need lights to light things you your flashlight just letting right what's in front of you your head land if you're going hiking get fair enough at lights what's in front of you so headlights or a great thing\nI write little a little bit of deep science air since I'd I don't understand this and I want to maybe you can get me a little closer to understanding it I'll Try when I read about light\nAnd\nThe ongoing study of what the heck it was much higher science thought it was in ... later they find out it is the idea that his ways and particles at the same time is something that's needs clarifying to me\n[noise] so there is an odd characteristic of everything on the very very small scale whether it's light\nWhere the particles called a full time or the particles like electrons or protons or neutrons all of these things have characteristics that are both particle liked and wave like now if you could really really explain that\nThat would solve some of the great mysteries and physics to really understand okay what we do know is that um particles behave like what we call wave packets there's a there's a wave that represents it\nBut it's a little packet and space that's moving so there you know there's an electron and if you're close enough electron it ... it has some wave like characteristics and light does the same thing we can describe light\nAs electricity and magnetism electricity wiggling back and forth and back this isn't wiggling back and forth together and they traveled together and that's ... and a little package and we can look at is traveling in a little package and so there are different kinds of\nWays you can sense light so right now all your listeners are sensing light by having an antenna on the radio\nThat antenna the wave is coming by okay making electricity move in that little wire and then we amplify it and make it something you can hear you have any deal\nThat's all the way right it's all behaving like a wave\nYou can also use your digital camera\nWhen you take a picture every one of the pixels in your camera right all those little dots there's a number associated with that and that's the number of particles of light that hit it wow isn't that God I was with that and you can measure that actually you\nCould read or write off your camera you could just take any picture that you took with your phone you open it up in any kind of software move your cursor overt it gives you the number right there's a number okay that number is the brightness of that pixel and that's how much light hit it\nOkay and that's a political thing so that's the layers personally yeah can actually do the particles and waves thing\nAnd you do it every day you just don't think about it right I think I understand what you're saying they can measure light as waves that could measure light as particles right hey but they really don't get how it all kind of mingled together\n... exactly I mean the math works and we can do the math yeah we just no way to picture it in your mind it's very difficult to picture in your mind that is true or or draw a picture of\nObviously weekly can draw conceptual pictures and that's it right\nI could draw conceptual picture that says you come across them wiggle and the wiggle gets bigger and smaller and goes away and in that region where we have the wiggle that's the particle\nAlready made out of a wave that's the best I think I can give you okay so back to the home front sure\nPeople have incandescent light people have neat that neon fluorescent fluorescence mhm and they have every day as it can you go through the different kinds of sure like fluorescent and then that lady that people have and why isn't the pros and cons of them sure\nUm\nThe incandescent is basically a piece of wire that gets hot because they put electricity through it in Edison made the first one\nUm and\nIt wastes ... well it uses a lot of energy to make light which is why they get so hot yeah a lot of heat\n'em and so incandescent bulbs\nOr an old technology pretty much going away in fact a few years ago a law was passed and says we shouldn't happen anymore I remember that yeah I'm fluorescent lights are lamps where you pass electricity through some gas and skates is mercury yeah\nThat close\nAnd then there's a coating on the glass tube that takes that light and converted into the colors of light we can say oh so that's why it's called fluorescent it's actually glowing so\nThe the light that originally created by the electricity through the gas\nIs actually there's not visible it it's barely visible as close to ultraviolet light so it's a matter of fact if you buy a plant light and yet it over your plants in the winter\nThat's a fluorescent lamps without ... oh my and it makes a lot of vulture violet okay which the plants like some of the different kinds of things on their life in ... and so you can buy fluorescent lights\nThat give you different ranges of white uh bluish white too and media white to a yellowish white\nThe really blue ones you see in a lot of places like supermarkets right you go yeah place and it's really bright and it's really glaring have you ever noticed like yoga factories there live that way it's very uncomfortable yeah yeah that's because blue light is bad okay bluish flight is very straining on your body\nAnd so you know that's kind of where they started you can get them now that sort of yellow or light\nThat's the the best of the fluorescent fixtures\nSo there's the downside of of I mean this is sound the humming right now the problem is some sort of by mhm thing going on you you barely noticed that can be harmful right\nEye it yeah it's an unpleasant or down it's an unpleasant sound yeah [noise] um [noise] then you have compact fluorescent bulbs\nWhich are the same as a fluorescent ball but made into a little ... you know quickly to that yeah go into your into your fixture we hate those write in a chill ladies came out that was kind of the next best thing for incandescents that was the next best thing yeah because they use much less energy and they don't put out the heat yeah\nL. E. D. technology has a number of advantages um they don't make any heated all they're very and if it energy efficient yeah they're very long lasting\nOr the fluorescent bulbs had mercury in them so they're so if you break a fluorescent it's actually danger yeah and you can't recycled and very easily and that lady nice solid state little tiny gizmo\nAnd Eli ... can be made to have a variety of these colors fade into the wish to the yellowish yeah by the frequency by the frequency and so if you get the yellowish ones these twenty seven hundred K. yeah babies are actually going to look a lot like the white you got out of an incandescent bulb\nGreat you know can you do extra innings can you stay longer sure I figured you could er we talked about it right absolute okay I didn't I didn't want to same presumption was\nThank you very much because I I really want to know how the how he did he actually makes light that's kind of what I Want to know next sure I can explain it okay good and uh we will we will do that Doug ... going to continue with us on WB\nSamaritans works to prevent\nGenocide if you need to talk about how you're feeling if you're grieving the loss of a loved one to fill time you're learning how to help out everything kayakers you can find support at for ... got or feeling desperate for I'm starting to buy anything in your life call or text American skate by hotline twenty four seven I'm Kevin Kevin\nKevin around forty six Seventy three visited some ... or ... ten thirty dot com slash ... cares\n[noise]\nW.

was a ... expensive trail system right a ... you know the land is preserved it's a great great place to go\nWhen you yourself live in a fairly dark area mhm uh can you talk about how different Lee you feel living there oh\nAbsolutely I I think living\nIn a natural environment is a very healthy ... you're you're not you know stressed by a lot of the day to day things that people put themselves through but you also have all sorts of other species around you you see animals walk by UC bird's doing their thing we have\nYou know what we're talking before about pollination we have pollinators all over the place because we don't have artificial light yeah so we have you know all these different things that are growing there and so\nUh is very much a healthier environment to live at than to live in higher stress polluted in various ways environment as soon as I live I\nStress polluted life I guess now that I think about it I feel like I have anti freezing my veins I feel so toxic after having talked to you or during talking to you and I look at I look around at my environment right here\nOne two three four five six seven screens some moderately size some giants eight and then a ... break clock\nAnd a lot of this is the bright blue bad light and of course I also had my phone and there's lights on in in this right off the lights in the on the MBTA mhm\nAnd my um sleep schedule is backwards mhm so I laughed pretty dangerous life here well the thing is that\nWe know that all of these effects\nAre negative on the body and they increase\nYour risk for various medical affects\nThat doesn't mean you're going to get them right but it makes it a lot more likely that you will and the and the beauty of this and you're asking for is what can you do about it yeah\nAnd those of you who have electronic gizmos which is pretty much everywhere and um there are settings that you can put on them or apps you can put on yeah that will actually make your screen\nYellow where it will take the blue out because it's the blue light that's really the problem\nSo as we talked about earlier you can have a red night light if you need light in that room but you can ... there's a setting on in Iowa

looked like a big courting and it uh you're just sitting there and all so\nMother Nature puts on some really good shows you don't you don't really need a two hundred channels on your TV when you think about all the shows that Mother Nature puts All right\nThanks Bill Bill in Durham alright got five minutes to talk about to launch is that are pretty significant an interesting go ahead\nSo uh uh of of our great space craft a masters just put up to new ones that are really really cool uh one of them is the park or solar probe so to go right back to what we were just talking about it's keeping track of what happens on the sun all the time you know we really need to understand\nWhat the sun does and how it works and be able to predict what these different effects are going to be and you know part of that is just for pure science 'cause we want to know but a big part of it is that\nUm when solar flares you're going to happen we can adjust the power grid move satellites around and do things so that you know you you can have all your toys and they'll they'll keep working\nSo the question is is it going to answer what questions do we have the disapproval answer\nWant to understand how the magnetic field of the sun works because that is what ends up creating all these fliers\nAnd we want to understand how the energy moves from the surface of the sun out into the atmosphere of the sun and off into space 'cause those are fundamental things we don't really understand completely and which have big effect on us you know you can see a pure mercenary and go hey I Want to make sure my electricity is always on we need to understand those things\nBecause of it and the spacecraft actually named for Eugene Parker who's a professor at the University of Chicago um it's one of the few times is I think it's the only time we've named spacecraft after a living scientist usually it's after somebody long gone you know name for the work that they did\nThis alliance share of the energy and his son creates ... created in the corner and come out you created on the surface or both all of it starts at the core okay all of it starts with the court\nSo the reactions that occur in the core produce the energy which becomes all white and the heat and everything that goes on in the sun ultimately starts with the energy that's produced at the\nCore what this is the question I should understand you have to do already probably but what you know what's burning in there is what causes it to do what it's doing is it the intense\nSo our average in the middle of the things ... so since we have a whopping three minutes I'll give you the very short\nVersion um stars work because this big ball of gas is is actually very heavy so its own gravity is pushing on the center of it very very hard center is very hot very dense and it's so hot and so dense that actually Adams hit each other in stick\nWhich is something that fusion you can't do at home yeah um and every time that happened some energy gets release so protons gets smashed together high strung and becomes helium and that releases energy\nThat's the dominant way that the sun's making its energy is its hydrogen Adams keep finding each other or getting pressed together becoming helium atoms releasing some energy that energy slowly works its way through the surface\nHeats the gas creates the turbulent makes the magnetic field does all that stuff but it all starts with those Adams at the\nCenter of a store I Will use sixty seconds we learn something very important in sixty seconds\nOK the other launch\nThose to another big question we have which is not other planets going around other stars and a last summer a very famous spacecraft called Kepler finished its mission discovering planets will the newest mission to continue that cold test\nWhich is the transiting exoplanet\nSomething or other I forget but basically it will continue to look at stores look at the planets that pass in front of them and we'll learn more and more about the planets that are out there because we discovered that not only is the earth not the only planet there are thousands and thousands and thousands of planets out there\nIn our galaxy exciting very exciting any plans to try to figure out what dark matter is\nAnd that's a whole other project there are lots of folks who are working on that to try to understand what dark matter and dark energy really are\nAnd um we don't know that's what makes it very exciting is to try to find out what it could be pretty significant paying like very signal more than half of Seventy percent of everything I've ever you know he don't know what it is yeah is that while it is wild\nAnd there's probably even more beyond that we don't know it was an has been great having you

probably probably before you come here I'll probably come up visit you I Love that come up yes absolutely come up spent spent an evening in the observatory looking cool things and then joined the

to\nEither take a photo of key parts ah or I'll actually take the book\nI guess in the future\nAt some point out I'm going to go through the David Bowie list\nThere's some classics on there as some of you are familiar with you know somebody like David Bowie more than just the music so I mean you get that he was an artist and\nI don't know a cultural leader if you will and you would appreciate probably the the books that but we thought was cool\nI Know that I share similar taste in music so I figured that\nI probably have similar taste in books too and it's just interesting knowing that I'm actually reading the very same lines in a book David Bowie read and I wonder if I'm thinking the same things some of the books\nOh that's a pretty English specific and you have to be kinda from a post World war two England to get it but not many there's ah\nOn the road Jack Kerouac is on their chemical stranger that's the one I but\nAlso I found a couple of the classics I figured you know there's certain things I haven't read why not I never read catcher in the rye I Know that's probably for young guys but I never read it and people reference at all the time so I'm going to read that what's

depending on how you have to find love I mean you might not be something that can happen instantly\nBut it might maybe all the love everything you need to know to fall in love you can divine instantly do you think there's such a thing\nI'll give you my my reasoning after this but I'm curious\n\nYour special someone you love was love at first sight or is it something that grew\nI Can't imagine knowing right away\nIt's just too many factors that have to fit into place to know all the way that's the way I see it on the other hand many of you may have\nSeen the person and the the the puzzle

evolution\nHe said do not believe in cosmology like\nThe way science works and the planets and all and do not believe in evolution I took it took a poll in no judgment area I just would like to take a

okay\nI Know specifically some people by name Doug doesn't and Sally doesn't I'm guessing really about half you people don't and maybe I'm wrong since hey half the people might not be wrong right maybe you're right and I'm wrong [noise]\nAlso the older I get in the closer to my end I was I was thinking I was walking down plum island the other day as you as you really get old\nIt must be kind of a covered in fact I think maybe they're maybe there is a God yeah and maybe I should just go that way just in case is that a factor the closer you get to the and\nDoes that mean you get closer to

this is a safe\nI could talk to you I get to learn all the other callers I have a relationship what everybody yeah and it's a safe it's a safe environment so this is my social media\nAlso it's not like on Facebook here if you if you are I mean there are consequences\nRight exactly\nThe shame um there'll be shame and and\nOf call\nUp and I appreciate the car with chat is not made no man's land where his father church goes I just I couldn't relate to a lot of what he was saying yeah um\nAnd I got a story about that I I made up a little story that has to do with what he said and what you said when you're walking down the street given all that thought\nAbout just to refresh everybody you're walking down the street and you start thinking about you know hey ah maybe I should I'm getting older so I should just not put off thinking about God\nNow it's not going all the time but the deal is this I thought about my mother and what a comfort that was to her and her\n... years and as a ... it's pretty easy now to not be involved but maybe in ones dying years and it's nice to have face and the right who knows man you know\nWell I have made a whole story about that I I heard a long time ago but I had at my own stuff to it it was the St demons that were applying for the position of add add on Cho\nDoes so Satan interviewed them I'm an even number three one position do after they after he won his position they interview the aim is that they asked the first one they said well what was your strategy he said well I told the boss\nOr I Would create a world of\nA pornographic material where everybody would be drawn to it and\nThey'd be drawn away from the things that go out and holiness and he said I I get pretty good I I Want about eighty five percent of them especially when when the high tech world came along and where are the computers I did pretty good one eighty five percent like they said if you don't get him and number two he said what was your strategy\nHe said well I just kind of strange man that there are smarter than God they could figure everything out on their own they didn't need 'em anymore and I get pretty good I I Want to ... percent of them are especially when the world of philosophy at science scientific data exploring and I said yeah\nWe hear all the science [laughter]\nWell okay I Know you got nearly ... million e crazy world of science\nOh well no I I I'll get to that are good anyway that Ninety percent that OK yeah which which I think oh you got it figured out around he said well why don't you and he said well I'm afraid to be ... so they interviewed number three is that well how'd you wanted to position it said was real terrible I just convince mandatory plenty of time\nA Ninety five percent a populist so he may be that hot show so you are made that up [laughter] yeah kinda I I\nHeard something like eight years ago but I just at my own characters to it\nThat's pretty good yeah I didn't like I didn't\nYou go to clarify something for me I like the devil was the head honcho though to these demons we're looking for the what what job like\nThe head honcho job to saint AS number one man that's what they want it\nDo you I mean the one hand any that\nYeah so that's how they they got the job you know but we do we did the best job he won them eat one wants people to say so but anyway I'm\nA science thing is it's not that I don't believe in science that just the science has to do with what's what's now that the difference between\nA naturalist and and uh a supernatural it's I guess you'd call it is the natural is fully have spent everything it can be explained by nature everything can be explained by science I Believe science exists but now\nLike I Believe that\nEverything couldn't have just created itself by accident\nSo old that has to be a supernatural element that set everything in motion and not a lot of sites like this that's the only difference\nIf you believe science right oh yeah I I mean you're on the on the ... tells you that we run into this problem because science tells you that you're an ocean the earth and six thousand years old is wrong\nSo you can't write truly believe you know I think for you you're reading a story and I did not make this up but I like it and when I heard it I thought of you who say all the books\nIt's all the books on religion and God go away right and they have to start from scratch when they come back there's\nCertainly no guarantee that they're going to be the same can be all totally different\nBecause it's\nYou know it's going to be all totally different whereas the if the books in science go go away and they have to do it from scratch again never it's going to\nBe the same stuff\nIt would be the latest stuff but scientific stuff would be the latest\nOkay what what what Dave because there's so many areas that it's been so many things that have been and Trump by somebody to come on it's smarter smarter smarter and if\nIt oh yeah we don't believe that any more because we prove that wrong so yeah we we have this new um and white men or whatever so it would be the latest okay I really the same\nLatest and that's the difference it makes it seem like religion is kind of made up where science is kind of observed\nWell here's another thing that I have I've been here for over four years now and you've had college gets on there and you asked every single one of them the same question and they never ever be able to answer it said well what we're out of the universe come into play what did it before that\nAnd nobody can answer that first giant you've you've tried you're out of it get people to answer that the smartest people on it and it's just\nWell I don't know [laughter] you know what what's on the other side of the universe questions I asked what was that even if it's like I don't know\nAnd so while you're doing is for anything that there's a question mark on you you plug God in there\nWell here's the thing I Would ask you a question why do you believe in evolution\nA well as long story but it makes sense to me\nOkay it because if you look at the science of it you had to convince you that your stores you trust but sauce that you got your information from and then the question why do I believe in creation creation because I trust that saw\nAnd then you thought right so we just you know why you're showing that source though I don't understand why you trust short\nStories by source is so corrupted I mean look at the I mean you you'd be within the church used to sell forgiveness sell like passes to heaven for money\nWell that I don't consider that the church I consider a threat to revelations Seventeen but\nIt's not I don't consider that a Christian Church All right it's not against the people it's just it gets that sets them All right Matt shift you read the scripture and you get into that ships that make it just doesn't match\nIt looks like it on the surface but it's not it doesn't really have anything to do that\nSo All right good job good job very good job I could be totally wrong science could be wrong\nWell scientific theory is different scientific fact I totally agree with and I ask you another question I probably won't have time for the answer but what\nWhen you hear somebody say hey futuristic set price you have eternal life well what does that mean to you what exactly does that mean\nI Know I hear different versions of it like it or you have you with matching\nI'm asking you what do you imagine when you hear that\nAh\nI don't want to go to some nice place and it's kind of white and comfy and uh it's very comfortable [laughter] we have to break now my man but you you've made me think Saturday busy\nCompanies physical work environment has a tremendous

... children die and hopefully no one's saying but to go into any of those no\nI think that was on it that way though right after pass I didn't go okay anyway quick what other people get on court Trader Joe's things I'm the first one's not a big deal but what I was growing up\nLate fifties early sixties that they would have more applied to what I mean we saw Trader Joe's okay\nLet's not let's

into it more when I was younger I also wanted it\nOnly about four percent of Americans believe in evolution and cousins\nLet's see [noise] really that's what I that's what the scientists that was with us tonight\nSixteen percent do not believe in evolution right\nWow\nI guess that guy was right when he talked about the ignorant mess with us I mean I don't know I'm a scientist but I listened to them and I think the evidence is overwhelming [noise] um but the thing about God you know creating us so that we could worship on yeah\nI mean I think I think father of the father explained it pretty well that was the reason he created a ... because if he had he would've never given a free will and for me and you know I Can't prove it and and it really doesn't\nCompute pulling a pure logic basis but it feels right to me in in ... somehow I was raised God is always refer to as the father and what does the father went from his child see once his love as respect\nWants him to go to the fridge and get them a beer\nWhile you're up would you give me a a give me a cook in the fridge to ride the juice to say\nWhile you're up okay God but you know I get your point yes hey drink of God as God the father of yeah and he\nWants you to honor and respect him and that's you know that's the commandments and all that then the other thing about the\nThe the age of the earth and evolution and all I think that's a misguided notion that was we were led astray by a man who first came up with that idea that the world was only five thousand seven hundred years old or whatever it is because\nThere's a thing I Believe it's in the Bible is not it's been it's been used on by a famous philosophers and religious people like a Tom Kline is St Augustine you know these guys that somebody mentioned that a few nights ago last week I guess that a day in Avon\nIs as a thousand years on earth\n[laughter] yeah and what I find need about that is there a scientific evidence that that is true Einstein's theory of
