I bet again we could be wrong\nBut knowing the way the civil rights movement worked in the sixties they were pretty they that's that's that's the that was the non violent way they followed the rules even some of the bogus roles to move the ball forward and then even though they had the permit yes the dogs and fire hoses were unleashed upon them Bull Connor and everybody after I\nHad to put the bodies on the line and doing that you also look at the worst\nOne and make sure we understand that I'm not going to agree that there was no permit and less until I find out that the fact unless you know for a fact they had no permanent\nI Can't you know I don't know for a fact either but I Can't imagine that had a permit I came from the sheriff who is going to arrest them and tell them they couldn't cross the bridge\nAnd maybe they slide and were denied yeah let's think about the war said it's just not civil to ... the way\nThis war citizens once again that's a protest um and they they probably ah I I Know they didn't have it for that\nBecause it's not the Nineteen fifty Frank I Know people are saying that and the number one sure don't protest no no no no you're missing Kate don't put\nWords in my mouth and if you're going to you know you better bring your a game if you're going to have a debate with me Okay Number one this is not the Nineteen fifties and people have a lot of freedom that more freedom than they had then\nNumber two they those protesters were actual protesters they were all dressed in their Sunday Best they did not commit violence even when the violence was being committed against them and they did not collect together and my violence they are two separate and distinct very distinct and I think it's actually kind of insulting\nTo people who protested\nIn the in the Senate chamber anybody either they didn't have any violence and let's look\nAt Egypt Frank I got to let you go because I've got a couple more people to fit in with okay but let's look at our own revolution if you worry much\nOkay next we're going to go to Janet Janet\nYour\nJanet you're on the air can hold on I can at least to some in my car okay today well thanks very\nGood I ...

C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never stuff [noise]\nThis is going to be awesome 'cause I've recently had a ... produce crisis\nOr during the summer I buy peaches at Trader Joe's by the way I had to throw him out some serious they ... that's right I'm Glad I'm here to the uh yeah they were tasteless they weren't really like peaches and sort of fake peaches they had no taste they had they were mealy just three alone it's frustrating\nI I agree I mean there it it stores that sell lousy produce it's really frustrating especially to bring something I'm an avid be rotten and two days\nI mean it is actually surprising these days given that that most consumers their perceptions of the stores that they're using it shaped largely by produce quality that these chains especially a lot of these large large chains don't have higher buying standards when it comes to produce\nA I think a good example of a store that has really high buying standards is white man's a Wegmans gets very very high marks from its customers\nFor quality of produce for quality of me for quality prepared foods it's largely what drives people's you why they love it so much why they love Wegmans so much\nA whole foods gets very high scores for quality of produce quality meat the problem is there a the tradeoff is that you have to pay a lot more for it white man's there's not a big price only at all really like that and in fact leg men's has lower prices than stop and shop and Shaw but gets far far higher ratings for rotted offers\nAs well about a mile and a corner down the road I'd never been to a ... in my life\nAnd it it is really kind of the exception to the rule word offers really high ... high scores from its customers for quality produce quality meat overall quality and yet it's prices are are lower than than a lot of its rivals\nUh another kind of exception to the rule is market basket I mean market basket is another fan favorite here in the Boston area\nA at for good reason it has very low prices its prices are among the lowest in the area\nA and yet it it's quality is is up there it's it's not a it gets very high ratings overall it doesn't get as high ratings for produce quality as as Wegmans or whole foods but people do like it a lot especially compared to the alternative\nI Know you folks really do care about supermarkets and produce because we've talked about it and this is a great opportunity to sign up for a checkbook dot org\nAnd also you can also compare positions lots of stuff that you need ... super cheap and something like sixteen bucks a year thirty two bucks for two years so it's it's thirty four dollars for two years okay this is the the the Seventeen dollars a year that break down that's yeah good yeah\nWell and what are the kinds of things have you done recently I Can't remember\nSo so Bostic consumers checkbook were non profit consumer group uh we are supported only by consumers are we don't take any advertisements from businesses we don't take any money from businesses all\nThere's a lot of places out there these days that that have ratings of businesses and all those other places they're funded by the ... some cells either through referral fee or from advertising and so it's in their interest to make those businesses look good\nNo not us were unbiased we are a nonprofit we're funded only by consumers are and ...\nFor a lot of people that's a big obstacle or to using grocery delivery on the other hand\nIt's a huge time saver if you use it effectively if you can make a list if you can plan and advance it's a big time saver and for a lot of families there there are more than willing to pay twenty percent ten percent more to having their groceries delivered than have to slip out to the store and drag their kids with them along\nUh the problem another obstacle you and I were talking about is you're relying on someone else to pick out your produce yeah because you don't get to squeeze in al tell you as we took a lot of produce deliveries from these companies not just in the cart but peapod and an Amazon and others and found that we often were very dissatisfied with the produce that were there was big for us\nAll right we're going to continue to drill down on local grocery chains and more with Kevin wrestler check book dot org WB news radio ten thirty this is a good one to ... called six one Seventy

means the doctors good or what\nShould you get your doctor like you choose your restaurant the busiest one I don't know I don't think that's a great idea at all okay so we're talking grocery stores

things rolling now it's ... in the in Roslyn deal although you\nHigh high badly and Kevin can I ask you is short for althea no okay Darcy Dorothea alright yeah [laughter] yeah where Dorothy you\nSpecifically about delivery because I Do get delivery Roach there's\nMaybe once a week or so and I try to buy stuff that's on sale for like one sample today I got to delivery and I'll you know buy a bunch of stuff so I saved twenty four dollars should be tried [noise]\nOkay so you have to kind of a strategic it that\nHow you shop ... when it gets really the stuff goes I totally agree with Kevin\nIt is a rip off [laughter] not only do they charge you weigh more than the uh you know if you went there in person but as you said the\nIt's ... [laughter] [laughter] so for me the most of my proudest goes um [noise]\nIt is a little tricky having sibling of ticket so [noise] you know it was for let's look at around here and you know come on [noise] um do you get good produce [laughter]\nUm you know if you want to go out and that kind of thing [noise]\nSo that's why\nIt's just outrageous sticking to it [laughter]\nThanks via the reason I said althea is in my town and Senate ... New Hampshire there was ... one of my classmates was named ... All right Kevin ... billion Wednesday now believe how do you do\nOkay I had a really really good ...\nOr ... or ...\nIs like stop and shop that different prices areas are on thing um\nMy daughter lives in ... where you live or she's been out for a male she takes they show the local stop shop going to the library and she had to obey the the\nThe one they're on ... street a ...\nUm is cheaper than than going to do and I've seen it up when I was living in rock and stuff for the show was still a little trick and they were selling\nCorn effects Pepsi's because like you think that you're getting cheaper than ... ... it's\nIt's kinda buyer beware um ... uh unions\nAre stuck push up as a unit market where they have to unions grocers union and they have they may or the or because you're in a so that they have they have to tell you that help more so that's one reason you\nStandard I always feel bad I don't know going back a second time is it okay to have one for the road and make up something in there I said I I if I have diabetes and I need another one\nRight [laughter] well it BJ's they have a rule that uh the parent has to be\nThere for the kids get to stamp out and so now it's embarrassing for me that they're going back for the the fifth time at our regular grocery store that keep talking about somebody cares about where I shop but\nA ... there again that people know them it's kind of serve yourself so it's not quite as embarrassing as like the big bowl full of ... cues with toothpicks and them or\n... or ... you can have one or two you're just not me saying you can have one means that fair to say okay you got one more\nOne more to know this is really the last one this is my last one you don't have a strict no in at this point like will be four or five miles away from\nThe where the samples are and I'm like just fine just go get it so I can get some stuff done here right but as I said I mean yeah it's they treated like above\nAll right is there any in New Hampshire the big Granite State or how do you do so\nI Can't rent there any and let me tell you what's happening up here I Am Kevin to New Hampshire they had a ... there's a market basket it's been tablets has been for many is about Twenty years ago where they built a brand new stopping truck right across the street [noise]\nStop there anymore and what happened market basket I couldn't compete with their prices\nBlew 'em out yeah this is a big problem for Shaw and stop and shop and all these conventional supermarkets and that\nUsed to be there was shows and stop and shop and kind of star market and and that was it that was those were really pretty much your choices now there's so many everyone's wants to be in the grocery delivery business these days you have target\nAnd the big warehouse clubs and and regional players like market basket and Wegmans are becoming really begin to Amazon with its purchase of whole foods are all these different companies trying out grocery delivery and it's it's it's kind of it's mystifying to a certain degree because\nThe profit margins on groceries it's really small I re Wegmans market basket make it work for them only because they have very efficient distribution networks they are only on the east coast or in the market basket case only in in\nNew England and so they can build these efficient distribution networks but ah shows and stop and shop and many others are really struggling because there's competition from so many sides from so many different players\nAnd a lot of the players that are competing with shows and stop and shop don't even care about profit so target for example has expanded groceries throughout at stores\nWalmart has also and the reason they have done that is not because they think they're gonna make a ton of money that we can make a killing on selling groceries nobody does\nIt's because they want to get you used to buying stuff from it Amazon once it gets you used to buying groceries from it so you just go there for everything and while you're there oh now you're going to buy the higher profit items that\nAnybody has gone to buy groceries at target knows that while you're there you end up buying other stuff you have this store actually now makes money off you and they figured out target even that they can devote a third of their real estate basically to groceries\nBreak even maybe even lose money but ... but because of the higher traffic in those stores they're going to come out farther ahead than they otherwise would because it was so\nYou have to get right on point and so these conventional\nSupermarkets are competing with that kind of mentality their their competitors are like we don't care if we lose money selling groceries because we're going to make it back in other ways but Charles and stop and shop it's not like they've responded by selling household good it's not like they've responded by selling other things that are higher profit\nThey're kind of locked into the grocery business and on top of that is one of your other callers mentioned they're also locked in the union contracts that are more expensive\nAnd it makes it makes it harder for them to compete on price than these other players because he's other players for the large parts for the most part are not union shops they may have union truckers they may have union butchers\nThat most of their workforce aren't unit that's not to say they're not paying as much so Pasco has a reputation of pain very high wages market basket as a reputation and Wegmans also pain fair wages um but it is that I I'm not here to unions because I but I Do think it's something to consider\nIf you're a conscious about this ... that some of these stores have uh our pain out better benefits and and wages than other yeah and you know you can look into that also it's\nProbably good that they're not getting on union but they they pay their employees pretty well but what they do and if you work they put money away like effect like a four one K. right and you could put in twenty thirty is he going to come out with a good deal of money you know what I'm saying when he retired\nAnd Costco was as a good reputation also for paying wages and in offering good benefits a Wegmans does also having very good neighbor relations without having union traders Trader Joe's to trader Joes do I mean so but that's not to say that it's better that their employees are better off than shots\nAnd stop and say I'm not going to get there because I Do think that one one issue with the non union shops is that they're not paying the skilled labor the higher rates that these other places are for so butchers for example aren't getting the the high wages the middle class income salaries that they might have union jobs\nUh but but it's an overall it's it's it's another reason that Shaw and stop and shop and other conventional supermarkets aren't real big trouble and many markets a safe way for example is is really one of the nation's largest chains\nThey pull completely out of Philadelphia for example uh they they just couldn't compete anymore with all these different is different offerings available\nNow I think puts out but you still sharp am I correct Kevin\nI I Can't I can never keep it all straight and the tension in an hour is that in in Safeway murdered so these these huge mega chain\nThey are are there again the storm Danish company owned them and I think\nWell so there's there's um a rail a hold owns I Believe Shaw but I again I Can't even keep track of it the scorecard yeah I just can't Safeway emerged which is interesting because they weren't mortal enemy that now one big company\nAnd it's because they just couldn't they could hear it anymore and it's that they couldn't compete with one another that\nThey couldn't compete with all these other options Ernie how do you know so much from markets\nA well I have I have a friend who is the manager down here at ... one of the market basket and a and an extra ... I read the section but here's my strategy Bradley I go over to Charlotte and provided for fighting on special\nYou know what I'm saying well yes and then I go my right on a shopping market basket ah [laughter] so I I picked I picked four or five items unfair that will be like we don't have the special you know on a weekend at a chart\nAnd then I'll do my regular shopping naturally at market basket I get the best of both worlds\nGenius Ernie thank you very much I like Ernie and he's always smart and to the point I like him Kevin wrestler consumers checkbook dot org one question be fresh market does that pop up at all be fresh as\nWe did in ... one of the problems we had an ... shop everyone we couldn't shop the Milton market sample and lots of others we would like to shop a lot of uh a farmer's market yeah but it's kind of pop up and go away it's\nRight to deal with and so I Want it to like be fresh\nCause I walked by it every day on Harvard have the help is just\nThe the help they hired just didn't get it yeah it just kind of the sluggish ah yeah I was the bums me out and so checkbook dot org you folks really ought to think about six thirty four dollars for two years\nAnd it does local services like doctors vets a\nChimney sweeps yeah probably didn't you know he's known to have some nice we do have to leave it was a local services especially home improvement\nStuff I mean that's really are special area is a focus is home improvement stuff and the medical care doctors and surgeons in hospitals and and dentists\nTo thanks again for coming in you're supposed to be here tomorrow by it might not have to because of the storm and the rain I don't know\nWhere my flights like and I was wearing my flights going to get canceled and it'll be fine\nAll right well thank you very much for coming in and I know that it was late at night and you and it's it's kind of a burden but I really appreciate that you come out as my favorite show\nA gay uh six Seventy five or ten thirty folks six one Seventy five or ten thirty so be it will be open lines are a number of things we can talk about Harvard and where you are reviews accused of bias against whites and men yeah what else\nOh I read a book and it's kind of\nDifficult to understand and I did understand I'm going to share with you what I understood and I'm also going to ask you now that have finished that book I Need something else to read and what needs to justice so there's that as well all night all morning here that would be easy news radio ten thirty would your ... and me Bradley Jay on WB\nSpending your life making someone else rich doesn't sound too good doesn't and online training academy they can show you how to take back your life by teaching you their pot and get approach to trading and investing strategy in the market learn strategies to generate additional income and take the first steps toward changing your life for you and your family\nRegister for online training academy free can't\nJust get free ...

I went to the bookstore and I got some use books like I told you\nAnd I get absorbed in reading them the right flies by it's an actual book in my hand that I and I like that it doesn't have a battery that needs charging when anything I I like it a lot\nKind of get lost in it you're not looking at pictures you're not looking at videos you know it's good and it was good you folks still read\nYou remember how much how ... how much you liked it and you might want to try it again\nSo I got three books I read one of them flew by the books were Albert camera who the stranger and heart of darkness and catcher in the rye you know I'd have never read that and I know it's\nI should have read it for a long time ago like in school but I I did not so inspired by ... being such a reader and me wanting to do something else I've looked at his list of our favorite reason I've chosen some from there the other two by the way are not on those\nI just got those because they were only four bucks and they were classics\n[noise] so I did read the stranger ... and I just wanted to talk to you about it a little bit it's a quick read it's a sin book and it's a it's super famous it's classic curative song about it\nSong is called killing an Arab and that's what goes on in the book I don't my mind that you know telling you what the books about I mean\nYou're not reading it to be surprised I don't think but it's an ... takes place in Algiers and it's\nYou know very straightforward description of a very everyday life is guy who is just a description of his interactions with people but\nAs time goes on he's is involved with a friend and then they get involved with a there's a problem with some Arabs that don't like his friend 'cause she's read and I think\nBeat up\nTheir sister or something like that anyway I'm going to tell you at a time\nSomeone dies and our main character goes to jail is a trial which is very interesting it's interesting in the the detached way he looks at it and this is key to the meaning of the book is very detached about everything\nTo his mother dies super detached\nAnd somebody asked him to do something you probably shouldn't do he's very detached his friend I'm was going to get in the fight with this with an Arab and he went along with it and they're very weird detached way [noise]\n[noise] and then here's this trial abuse it use it in a very detached way but as his execution\nNear as you start seeing seeing things in a different way which you might think that's obvious there's more to it and that than that and it's just written and and such a way that it makes it a great it's a great book it's not\nGreat like a Michael Crichton book it's great and another way it it's an example of magical it's it is it takes you to a different place different time a different feeling it's an old book too but the description of the ... there\nNeeds to see in the sand the descriptions of the hot sun and the sea and the sand and the sweat dripping in his eyes as he as he\nEncounters this Arab which affects what happens\nTotally good read you can get a use ... you can get a library I didn't really understand what it was about so\nI Googled it I said I Googled

don't like to know\nThe number two it bothers me the the Republicans want to take away the protections against you being bumped from your insurance for pre existing condition out of all the things out there\nProbably more important than immigration for me\nIs that I I fear that that is a problem\nWhenever I think whatever problems you directly experiments through\nIllegal immigration pale to the kind of problems that you see if you get bumped from insurance for pre existing condition or if you have to pay a lot more every month for pre existing condition that direct you know the cars and you know the effect and while I Do approve\nOf some of the president's policies and the Republicans policies absolutely\nThe fact is that their friends to big business and insurance companies are big business and they don't have to cover your pre existing conditions they make more money and that's a problem for me that is a big big big big problem for me if if that weren't the case if they said we'd like to\n[noise] we'd like to make health care better but not take those kinds of things out then I'd I'd I must be on on board with it there's certain things I don't like about\nThe\nCurrent health care situation for one I have to pay for coverage maternity coverage right\nAnd I ain't going to need it because I have to pay for taxes for schools to and I ain't going to need those either supposed to be do some stuff just for a better society but I really don't think I should have to pay\nFor I don't think I'd have to pitch in other people's maternity coverage because I don't want them having kids\n\nSo there's that would be pre existing condition protections are extremely important and to the president and the Republicans want to take those away\nSo if you're an older person with a preexisting condition by the way than you do not want the Republicans or this president if it's a big thing for you\nI it doesn't seem fair you pay you pay your pay and then you get sick and then

on a bill only pay so much for that\nMedicare or Medicaid Medicare I Wonder if the previous caller was talking about Medicaid I don't want to start at about Medicaid oh I thought he was talking about Medicare no no\nNo minute ... you know I Want my whole life and the thing is is I retired when you were supposed to work sixty four and a half [noise] and then ah the thing is is that um\n[noise] so I get my Medicaid card and everything like that so everything I Do right now from here on and I have to do my ... my co pays [noise] which people with Medicaid rub mass so they don't have to do and ... and every time I have something that\nI have to pay a pretty good portion\nAt the way that in my pocket which are probably had Medicaid or I Wish I did a match how they wouldn't have to pay anything\nWell if you don't so that's what I mean what how much of a percentage like twenty percent right\n[noise] oh I don't know I Can't uh last time I went to the doctor was like Fifteen hundred dollars and I had the ability for Fifteen minutes it to the lake at the end of the deal I had a two hundred Ninety five dollars I had to pay out of pocket\nYeah that's exactly twenty percent\nYeah but the thing is is I kind of recent I hate to say this\nBecause I now I live in a building which has a lot of people are on Medicaid mass helped and everything like that and I mean I I'm just outraged

to cut health care\nI understand that I understand that I mean the thing is I didn't vote for him don't want any way [noise] but the point in their system they well they can then they just seem to have the power and they're riding the tide and the people who are getting all these things are like I said\nI don't think they're paid and I really don't think anybody's paying attention that's certainly not vote and Bradley my town\nNobody's bone in your town LOL\nIf they're not ... it's like Fifteen Percent or whatever it is a very small percentage and the thing is now with the ... it's

I'm Sorry to interrupt you but you can get somebody from on one of these health care organizations like I'm your man or or or or United healthcare or or somebody like that and maybe they they do that people don't come out and and talk to you\nDid they know about all the Medicare though or just about all they sure do I mean why would they know about part hey if they're only covering ... be for example while I was about the restrictions or part D\nWell the thing is like they were to cover your medical ... excuse me they cover your a medicine to\nOh the supplemental plans\nOr yeah so the supplemental plan helps you out with here do not in part D and your ... okay so you're a big fan which which uh you can tell me which company like which which one do you like\nUm ... healthcare okay\nUm I've had them for almost a Fifteen Years now\nIs there a particular named to the product that you buy\nUm I mean like I mean um as far as what a\nMedical name of your your policy is special\nThing but it's it's\nUm it's called the supplemental plan a and um that's basically it\nDid they check to see if you had any pre existing conditions or doesn't matter\nNo it doesn't matter All right you know and I think uh you know [noise] I'm originally from Massachusetts and I listen to you on a written solicit every night I took it down in North Carolina a family\nI Want to be around my kids I see and uh and how do you like it down there a wonderful you like it is yeah it's so much cheaper or\nI got put it this way I was living in an apartment in and Lyn okay and and uh uh\nThe rent was go my rent would have gone up to Seventeen hundred dollars a month yeah okay and I got I got three bedroom home a half an acre of land or a car\nThey're a shoulder at full basement and um pay less than half of my rent\nAnd land so do you own this new place oh yeah but I mean you're paying less than eight hundred bucks for mortgage it exactly\nBut I mean I I got through the VA so it helps you know uh uh I couldn't have done another one\nIn ...

I missed the accent\nYou know a\nRag sent there's no accent\nYeah right [laughter] okay [laughter] it's very you know there that have the accent\nExactly [laughter] exactly that's a that's a really down and you talk funny [laughter]\nBut anyway ... I I I Know you get a people are waiting and uh\nUh like I said I I just wanted to give you information\nAll right thanks ... that's good info All right thank you take care okay\nSo yeah like speaking in Lexington North Carolina is well about a quarter of the size of Concord New Hampshire it's real small Nineteen thousand\nI mean there must be nice to be smaller than smaller than Brighton right I Would think Greensburg is a big town when since big\nLexington not so much good Lexington, Kentucky is a different story six one Seventy five or ten thirty give me a shout open lines\nBut talking about the ins and outs of Medicare it's pretty interesting to me it's it's an unknown territory I've been studying up on it just 'cause it's it's really since I speak to people who are on it all the time I Need to know about it some day I'm going to know about it too\nThere's part a which is\nYour hospitalization is tough part B which is kind of how patients stuff\nPart C or the sea option I think is the uh advantage plans and then parties the drug part\nAnd there are lots of ins and outs about lots of complicated stuff about when to sign up for example if you're working and you already have insurance do you need to get ... be right away but it depends on where you work it depends on if they have enough employees depends on stuff\nAnd you may be in a plan you may be in a situation where you don't have to get being stopped paying for it right away\nWhich is good especially if you're making a lot of money because if you're making a lot of money you have to be quite a lot for it\nAlso there's part D these the drug part and you may not think you need it now\nBut if you don't sign up for it you may have to pay a penalty fee every month for the rest of the time you use it forever and says people recommend you sign up for it anyway and\nThen there's the doughnut hole in the drug coverage I'm learning all this I studied up on it today\nThere's a certain up to a certain point was difficult to explain\nYou'll be sharing costs with your insurer over them there'll be some you pay some up to a certain point and then they don't pay anything\nAnd then you get to another level up higher and then it kicks in again but there's this bully blank in the middle way you don't have any coverage and I'm Wondering and I don't know if if that blank spot in the middle there\nIs covered by your for example you're United healthcare supplemental plan I don't know maybe there are versions of supplemental plan to do is versions of don't\nBut I appreciate the opportunity to talk about it a little bit because if I were basically what I just did there was help myself remembering by explaining it to you\nI could get more details but I'd be kind of guessing and I don't want to catch on that I really want a guest expert and we shouldn't do is just once we should do it like every six months\n'cause it's really suit as one of the most important things that can do for you is get you the information on how to do Medicare rights they don't screw that up because it's a lot of money\nSo what is W.

Taylor and say no\nI didn't think they could say no I saw them as I understood that you had to just pay more\n[noise] no I uh I don't know what they cut a the a ... candle God it was coming out of my checkbook count automatically won it cut off\nAnd breaking the action and they they are completely\nThere when I get that go on and they sit now you've got a preexisting condition with ... you're on\nWhich seems weird to me I mean Medicare is there for you because you're it's a stop gap measure it it's a safety net\nAnd it seems like me I Can't believe that they would say they wouldn't let you on my understanding they would just make you pay more if you had a gap they they rise it ... is it true that Medicare won't take you if you have a preexisting condition\nOptional on from a a it had the you know not old enough that no yeah\nI Am not in our study that's already if it's a it's probably you don't have to take a look\nAt me and it's just absolutely crazy it's twilight\nZone and so because it's optional and you know you know it's extra then they don't really consider it to stop ... kind of thing and if you haven't actually well what if a man\nWell they don't want to go on because they know I have a heart condition so I'm a high risk a person who made the effort to spend some money\nAnd that really ever to name you'll never be able to have to be a\nA timely hire the local area and we're going through the motions or I'm going to sue the bank but not know the thing that they cut off my account because I knew for a long time and they didn't have to be any law\nSure they do have to prove they didn't\nAll I got letters from saying\nYou know it was not my fault but they uh\nThey don't care if it's a private company that\nProvides a lot and they share that yet another horror story thanks W busy\nAnd I aren't media we know that marketing or customers is a challenge Disney says of all sizes share we can help not only does media reaching Ninety three percent of Americans every\nWeek more than Facebook Google and even television but recently privacy concerns have for social media platforms to slow down their advertising options while radio is expanding its reach targeting through the heart media\nLap every day visit I heart radio dot com to learn more and gang visit I heart radio dot com and put an attempt to work for your company\n\nW visa ... W ex ... two men and I heart radio station\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio ten thirty weather news was never so [noise]\nAnd there were you down here in Massachusetts than\nI I worked in that area I traveled back and forth I remember that well that works for the good old days\nAnd do you live in a matter of\nFact I I I'm On Thirty years and now I've I've got firsthand experience with um the so called free health care of other countries several countries ... matter okay and uh\nI you know it always amazed that I mean the people that have never experienced it\nIt gets so great I'm experiencing Quebec several times when I saw in the hospitals are actually that's where we are involved in a professional race and years ago\nAnd we've been traded several times the different members of the teams and you know I've been in the hospitals weatherman in actually been victims of the healthcare system up there myself with substandard care overcrowding public hospitals are under staffed public hospitals or any particular incident was or\nSomething we have to be that way they just don't doesn't it doesn't it doesn't but in any not touching wrong then I thought\nWell that country that has a base as two separate systems may have and I have a lot of friends in my business relations at and are in Quebec and the people that you know have money\nEarned as close\nAs they can pay supplemental and chose to go to private households\n[noise] you know so unfortunately you know we weren't doing we were only allowed to go to a public hospital because that's what's up emergency services and like I said every time the Syrian substandard in my opinion from ... surgeries to myself personally I've been enjoying that required\nFor the treatment of home due to pull them selling a jury into my knee um so you know my experience with that particular countries system is flawed but like I said they have\nThey don't that's there's probably a system no or a bad doctor\nWhile it's government run under staffed um you know one of these major hospitals are and one time they asked ... on a Saturday afternoon to add to call in\nRadiologists I'm up to treat this person was obscene that was severely injured have spinal injury\nYou know just forget to getting jam not particular day that was twenty nine treatment rooms with two doctors on staff and six dollars and waiting room was fault so it's kind of a system you know it's free to the everyday people the taxes paid for it the system as it used its not perfect by any means\nUm I I'm stuck to the situation I'm self employed\nI have only choices in the state of mind to buy health care from impulse I'm Still has her fingers and so what I have my business of Seventeen employees we had\nAs many as eight different ... said now moved to la la\nLa Crosse MBP a bunch of private ones that were had decent plans on a state revamped it drove those you know they drove those companies are now are stuck with MVP and Blue Cross which are basically went up so here lies the problem insurance companies are greedy um\nAnd the rates are high 'cause there's no competition in two thousand twelve\nMy family plan a at that time was eight seven hundred and sixty six calls for\nThe plan a month and it was a halfway decent plan that same plan now is not available but ... stuck to use which is close to it to the fact we only have blue Cross Blue shield to choose from is\nJust about ... hundred and forty dollars avoid [noise] San Francisco for a fifty percent and that's because there's no competition now you could go another stage\nOf the states that have multiple carriers and you can get a family plan for you know three to four dollars less or paying my sister doesn't Hampshire so they ... out of the biggest problem is insurance company is lack of no competition you create among monopoly\nInstead of a free market you sweat prices go up there was no competition efficiency there's also and so that's one problem\nAnd I've also experienced healthcare in Cuba that was a disaster\nA that was just recently within the last three or four months\nSo they don't need that\nUm my we're down their trip\nOr my wife ... developed a problem will lay severe swung our way they are they thought it might have been a blood clot so we went to the hospital and have Anna um it was on a Saturday I was I was a Saturday Saturday Night I think that was\nAbout seven thirty eight o'clock they finally got a scene just shy of midnight um they had to call in a radiologist doing all this on our like a bad one doctor on staff at gp on stopping the emergency room uh\nI I was reading the emergency room went into the bathroom a known them during the ... on the stalls no hot water no salt no paper towels and the bathrooms um [noise] this is a hustle Havana which is you know again has completely free health care\nOr they finally have their radios just looked at her uh they said ah she's got ill and infection and whenever they gave us antibiotics and they all said that results of the sonogram what's actually was developed in a in a terrorist causes it basically said\nFifty year old woman you have a fifty seven year old woman you have the legs or Seventy five year old woman\nWhich they are doing all the toilet her so when we got home she went and saw a doctor and we'll put all Tucson again a\nNo author is a fine and given another on drugs to treat touched so probably about a week after ... been straight about so my experience is you know they're not as well as you know another ... years ago when I was younger and down the islands have never been done but with what they socialize medicine or\n... yeah but this Cuba and I don't see why they have to be bad like the Canadian wants no usually well let's look at\nLet's let's look at the VA the VA is a perfect example of a government run health care that as best as mediocre and in the in the VA mediocre\nMaybe fair okay only in metropolitan areas where they have you know\nA large amount of doctors a at a large amount of um of a retired I'm you know veterans\nOr you know that um where they can support a full time medical staff audio VA hospitals are contract doctors part time doctors part time nurses contract nurses primary stop I hear complaints from people I Know that go to the world will be A's sets of white river or some over in New York San main\nBad they never see the same doctor twice now every time they go in there it's like normally can because it's a rotating thing of temporary part time doctors so I you know the private private industry to always do things better then government\nAnd this from wrote care and road construction to health care in my opinion are the problem we run into his why now when we have we have three different problems that we don't see any other countries won\nThe drugs the drug problem as far as the costs of pharmaceuticals pretend that we get really stuck to his on this country and the government does nothing about it because our politicians are in bed with all big drug farmer right\nRent that with um they're getting the packets padded that's probably the one that's there for many ... biggest thing that I'm a conservative I you know unfortunately I was limited to a choice to vote for on my check at\nA you know I bought it for what they what was supposed to get done not not the lots of particular person Ron doing it um so we have drugs farmers one thing lawsuits\nWhere you don't have all these frivolous lawsuits along these other countries you know they you can't sue somebody in Canada because the ... of the drive through things like that don't happen is the same thing that health care but the medical malpractice\nIn Canada is very very limited as well as what people can collect uh on on these lawsuits so that will lower cost of health up there and then the you know instead of one of the other things is this is the lack of competition between insurance companies so transcribe them in a field day\nWhere you know by setting their own rates and being able to take not take any people at risk they weren't all they want all the gravy but they don't want the lumps that come with it they don't want the rest so there's a tree things need to be addressed\nI Believe by it by having term limits in D.C as well as on the state level\nOr a ... I think you'll see the chance for some of the things to change the private sector [noise] you know now that prominently chose this we heard about where we're going to get cross border able to go by on the open market a health insurance from other states to have more carriers I don't\nKnow why that hasn't happened up because that would definitely help lower the cost of health care in this country\nIs that what it's all you are very ... you know you're awesome you are very convincing\nNow I don't I don't generally calling these talk shows but like I said I have firsthand experience with dealing with Charles companies are having you know a Seventeen Eighteen fulltime employees that I provide health care for ... from and from my travel experiences both north and south of the border\nHey guys got a pretty good handle on yeah you're very convincing so I'm going to take a break and then ...
