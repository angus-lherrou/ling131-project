R. issuing that um and there are what's known as mortgage backed securities or agency bonds I'm so these are basically ... bonds that are repackaged mortgages\nAnd I don't I Will actually can you explain that I don't understand okay\nSo uh\nAgencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac yes um when you get a mortgage they basically by those mortgages\nAre getting a mortgage I I go there and I say I got to buy a house I Need money\nYeah so you you get money so you you day on how you go to bank of America say yeah bank of America it's a and you've you've satisfy certain conditions like give twenty percent down in yeah where if\nA then what happens is they uh Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac basically will guarantee that the the repayment repackage\nThe the bond your mortgage with another hundred mortgages the guaranteed repayment from you at a hundred other people people right so yeah and they'll repackaged led into a security yeah\nI'm ... years when you buy mortgage backed security you're basically buying a little share of a hundred people's mortgages\nIncentive for you kind of on a\nLittle share of their house that's right and if they default on that on their house payment if that's a problem\nUh so that's worth Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's insurance command so if they default Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac come in and they they guarantee that payment\nOkay and is that is is this related to what happened in say two thousand eight\nSo those were different in two thousand and eight these were known as subprime mortgages so a subprime mortgage would be if you don't have a twenty percent down if it's an a speculative condo in Las Vegas or Miami a\nLame vetting on the on the purchaser\nWrites the no guaranteed income no documented income um and so you\nKnow banks were were eager to give out these mortgages these things got repackaged probably\nThe banks are going to give them up because they were guaranteed\nThey they could repackage them through some financial engineering I see 'em and in this sort of convoluted financial engineering\nThey were basically able to make what look like terrible mortgages repackaged and make them look like a ... diamonds and the rough\nAll right okay so that's a mortgage backed bonds what else\nThose those those are the four big ones I Would say um you know in terms of uh you know when you're thinking about bonds then each bond tens have different characteristics so ah\nCharacteristics are important and bond says first of all how long maturity is that right is that a one year bond a ten year bond to thirty or bomb\nYou'll get your money back with interest depending on what the maturity is if it's one year you get your money back plus the interest and you're done that's right or Thirty years right near them\nAnd so obviously you know\nIf you make the longer commitment you're you're in some ways Barrymore interest rate\nRisk right so uh today's you know you could buy a bearing more interest rate risk meaning what\nSo in this sense so if you bought a say ten year treasury right now I think ten years or ... like three three percent three uh three point one percent okay and um\nYou know\nThat's not a great interest rate does your liking him for ten\nYears risk as an opportunity because you could have taken that money at that point and put it in a CD and made more and and have more liquid actually write\n'em do that so that's not exactly the the rest of the risk is you buy today at three percent a year from now interest rates are six percent and now you're locked in to having this vehicle is paying you oh so you're going to see her sad if you'd\nGotten a shorter term one you could reinvest it at a higher rate that's right and you're missing out on that 'cause you chose ten years that's all right so long term can be a bummer but long term can be good you were talking about treasury is it time to go to the treasury bills now where do you do bonds yeah but that ...\nSo\nSt security officers treasury bills those are under a year yeah um then there's treasury notes that's two to ten years\nOr are they bonds and in fact there in effect ball given your money to the treasury are they going to give it back with interest that's\nRight so it's just it is a bond that is okay so you're talking about and imagine if you had gotten we just talked about how it's bad to get locked in not always resonate if in Nineteen eighty seven to ... new body thirty year treasury bills or bond\nAnd you're locked in sixteen percent for Thirty years insane\nYep you looked pretty good shut it looked pretty good at worrying man right I mean it's just pretty worry free yup yup and but in Nineteen eighty two you did not know that inflation was going to be brought under control you ought to put yourself back in the early eighties when oil prices and inflation was running\nYeah but you know what in hindsight is this for me and I'm not telling you what to do any time you get it for like sixteen percent if you look at the ... the top and the bottom of what your interest rates are\n... if that's a pretty safe thing if I had to do it over again easy easy to say I feel like if I knew how good sixteen present really was regardless of the end of the\nInflation\nI probably grab it if I had a chance to do that now anyway\nNow pros and cons of bonds which takes let's take some cons of bonds so some downside and various situations\nSo so I think three big big risks right so one is interest rates and sort of\nOne oh one overall interest rates go up the price of the bond goes down and prices\nOf on goes down doesn't affect you much unless you sell the bond is it just goes to\nMaturity that price doesn't matter that is right except if you're in a bond fund if you're in a bond fund and that's the case and the overall value of your pieces of pie goes down some that's correct can you explain how that more so I can understand it better\nYeah so so for an individual investor I'm buying specific bond says is probably not very efficient way to get a sort of diversified portfolio um bonds are ...\nAre expensive to to buy and sell 'em for retail investors it's almost impossible to have corporate bonds I'm\nOK for individuals like folks listening ... chances are that is not going to be not going to work out generally doesn't yeah so there are alternatives yes\nSo the alternative is to invest in say a\nA bond mutual fund so this is a mutual fund that holds a big basket of say corporate bonds government bonds what have you depending on the fund and\nBecause then you've got to take advantage of the economies of scale bond that is right bunch of what they save by buying a a bunch and plus you you have diversification safety that's right\nAnd they're going to manage their interest rate risk which they considered to ration um that's just a measure of interest rate risk they're going to keep that serve basically constant\nAnd the fund so that they're always sort of adjusting to fund um for you know to sort of opt to look up on the condition\nYou know is there any chance you can stay later 'cause you're good and we haven't finished ... okay\nCool because I Want to find out more about was we've only done three questions on bonds and that was the main topic please feel free to ask questions about bonds use what we talked about so far maybe you've always wanted something about bonds well this is your chance free human not robo advice to somebody busy\nA lot happens while you're asleep morning I'm Jonathan Weiner joining alone there are named ... around two am\nFollowing our only by the time you're getting and having your first cup of coffee\nHere to bring all the news from around the world to know because you're whether together any more they accuweather\nShower responsibility to make sure you the best in the morning\nBecause we live here too easy names when the dirty\nW Veasey buses WXXI Kay s F ... two men for an eye heart radio station [noise]\nBusiest W Veasey news radio ten thirty with a new one [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat's right so normally normally a bond fund would have a regular payment right that would be um\nThat they promise you or it fluctuates they promise within range how does that work\nI they're they're not going to promise you it\nTypically the average of all the coupon interest and the ... that's right okay so you're going to get some actual coupon interest yeah okay so even though the value of\nThis finding itself might cut down you are getting still in addition and separate from that the coupon interest to me that's that's important question as your typically\n\nOther exceptions\nSo so I think it it really depends on the product writes us on Sunday or just going to reinvest that within the fund yeah right and so that's going to be built into your your accumulated certain that as a value the fund is going to increase in value how over time by the value that coup so that would\nThat coupon interest a counter balances any loss you might have to do the value of the prince about the bond itself the marketing department I tell you that you have two things going on the market value at the bottom and the coupon interest\nAnd in some cases you might just get the coupon interest and other ... you might get the average of all the couponing interests right or it might be backed in a kind of has ah\nIt might just be basic part of the whole reinvest it into new bond so the coupon interests would come into the fund right and the fund manager would then take that coupon interest and re invested in Dubai\nAnd so in that case why do you get is\nA combination of the fluctuation in the market value and the coupon interest desperate and some cases the market value micro down\nSo that might reduce your coupon than just a little bit but you still bet couponing she says the factor that's right you're not wholly dependent on the market value of the bonds you know the market value of the bonds may bring the total value down a bit\nSo so this is the the interesting and I write I just want to do I have it that's right okay right so so when you raise interest rates there's sort of these two effects right on the one hand the valley\nThe bond falls in terms of price terms but\nYour coupon interests that you're getting gets reinvest that at a higher interest rate oh okay so those two sometimes can be offsetting I'm at a few timeline rising longer the reinvestment effective investment in higher interest rates actually\nProbably dominates\nOh All right the uh so I was bombing that out you know if I if I had a bond bomb and I was concerned that if I had a a bond and a rising interest rates and then I was being dumb or a bond fund that I was being down but not necessarily\nI don't think so okay good it depends on how smart the managers that that's good well we have some questions you ready sorry okay you never know what you're going to get you ready yep okay we'll see how many more conspiracy theorists we have\nWe have a first mia David in Boston this is good solid actionable info\n[noise] Dave how\nAre you good I'm I'm calling I had a question about ... bonds but it just dawned on me that I have some double re launch believe it or not that I bought some of the well Thirty years ago I avoid it Thirty years because\nIt interests for that length of time and then they stop\nAnd I put them on my name and the beneficiaries in a man I'm Around to cash them now but a visa have fallen out of favor of a notch and and I wondered why\nWhen I was tough for us to hear what type of bomb they were\nThey're double either called the police and they're very popular for example the ones I have a more popular are the ones I have or face value a thousand dollar bonds that you would pay five hundred dollars for\nAnd then over the thirty year period you could catch them before Thirty years but for example I avoided the thirty\nOh and show I go to the bank and collect about twenty four hundred dollars dubberly\nBonds I'm the savings bonds and they were low risk Jennings products that and they get interest for I ... up to Thirty years right up to only way to buy him was to buy 'em in the electronic form and and I think he treasury just direct right\nWell you can buy them at the bank and and those days oh All right All right so I don't\nI don't uh they're no longer issued in the paper form right\nNo you can't do it at the bank anymore okay but I Wonder why they are not a falling out of favor\nBut I guess so I I I think it had they've\nThey've been effectively replaced by treasury direct um so now you can basically by treasuries\nI'm In small small quantities directly from the treasury did they do need to do these extra\nBut of course the interest on them is very low I understand so in any case I'm not buying them but my question to you or the reason for my call was on municipal bonds and the fact that I had bought those sold the house was several hundred thousand dollars and I was able to lock in five percent\nAnd what about twelve years but then they got cold and I wonder if you didn't distinguish between call ability and non call ability and the fact that you could actually I've learned that you could specify when you buy immune eight\nOr that you are a non call level is is this correct now I'm not sure about the interest will be considerably less than a ...\nThat's correct so so for the rest of our listeners just to make sure we understand what it called the bond is\nA a ... bond gives the ensure the bond the rights to basically re purchase that bond prior to maturity so it could have been a thirty year bond\nBut you know they\nThey could buy it for power or for a slight premium as say after Fifteen Years um and so that that that option to the company or the ... that issues the bond is is valuable to them\nAnd so in return for that option they're willing to pay you a higher interest rate up front\nI ... when I get called ... which is that bad\nSo it's it's it's\nBad for investors perspective right because typically the bonds are calling or paying higher interest rates than current interest rates but in some ways you've already received your return right you've made your reward because you've got higher interest rate for a longer period of time\nHere yes I'm sure there's like a question relating\nImmunity from was there was those municipal bonds was the ... the money that you earned was that tax free tax free and that's pretty damn federal you're you're a smart guy I guess\nFive percent when we get five percent today but I guess I haven't checked originally but if the market's down I guess manager up\n[laughter] so do you have any further questions first David yes I just wanted to distinguish or\nAsk 'em I'm Ryan\n... you're buying a mutiny our general obligations would you recommend a general obligation over a revenue bond which is more security\nAre typically it's going to be a general

probably why he was a little fuzzy on the war bonds 'cause I guess they may not have had more bones so I Want to go back\nTo the target date funds and I think that a lot of folks might find them attractive way it works is you know I'll just took it off\nThe research say you plan on retiring in seven years so you might pick a\nTarget date twenty twenty five that's right fund and that'll be all sort of set up knowing that you don't have time to regain any losses you're going to need some income so and so it's probably going to be\nWhat Ryan\nIn terms of mix and yeah\nAll about say twenty twenty five ... somebody that might be preparing to retire and seven years\nYeah so that that ... going to be very conservative it's it would I Would not surprise me that the that fun would maybe have eighty percent of bonds\nBonds yeah what ... what sort of bonds would they likely have doesn't matter\nSo a target date fund invested in other mutual funds was in the complex of it's a fidelity target date fund that defined itself is then allocating across the different Fidel like fun\nIt's not going to black rock\nWell it could it could okay it could uh but typically they would keep it in complex\nOkay and there would be conservative and a lot of bonds and the goal is to what about\nWhen people need income or are they gonna by the way they're gonna keep that fund\nPast twenty twenty five I Would just generally more income or they done at twenty twenty twenty five\nNow that that fund would continue on\nOkay so now it's that you retired in ... when he joins that's right and you ain't working and you're probably going to need income mhm how does it generate income for you\nSo\nYou know again this is that this will depends specifically on the fund right I'm okay for an example\nHow one might one find might generate income so so defined could be set up to give you sort of regular disbursement\nThe you know pain when does it come from is it comes it's coming from them it's coming from the fund itself right the income that defines generates always coming from income\nThat defines generating or like who um who bananas however says it\nCould be from sales of the CDs it could it could be from the\nSale of principle of the bonds and the fund the bonds of one could mature right and then you're going to have every afternoon money um\nAnd instead of investing in something you might take some of that cash that we got a burning up principle if you're spending money from a bond sale right unless it's a profit from bond sale\nSuicide you read the the funds\nIf ... if you if it uses funds from bond bond sales right to disperse view\nAnd if\nYou don't have a ... as much to reinvest ... correct it starts to dwindle the principal\nRight so the principle that the the bounces these funds overtime should decree\nOkay I'm actually twenty twenty five at least right probably gonna see yourself losing some principle\nAnd that's kind of kind of actuaries you out to figure out how long you might live and how long you might need the money\nAnd the thing yeah I think that that's a\nFair way okay do you happen to know how long they and you probably don't just checking expect someone to live after retirement these days is Twenty years\nIt's funny so I actually look that up today I'm sixty five a life expectancy for men is to live live for so you're eighty four and for women it's to live to about eighty six eighty seven years old\nOkay so you're looking at if if nothing hits the fan ... needing cash for Twenty years\nThat's right and I think most people do not think in those terms I think in those terms right there you know and and then this this also comes back to whether you want how conservative you really want to be if you need to preserve your\nYour wealth over a twenty year period right the key is to\nCan you can you say you're going to retire and joining twenty five according to fund and then to find behaves like he retired but you just keep working\n...\nOkay 'cause that's where people are going to have to do right how many people your guests have enough money to survive in the ... mode which they become accustomed Twenty years after retirement\nYou you know like it's at twenty five or something twenty five percent yeah it's probably even lower than that I mean the ah thirty percent of people have less than ten thousand dollars thirty eight hundred people there he was out of the entire a demographic or older people\nTen percent at thirty percent of people retire okay our retirement have less than ten thousand dollars in savings [noise] um and I think if you go up to the you know in the if you go to like two hundred and fifty thousand um\nYou know I I think it's it's it's like ten Fifteen Percent of people have that much in savings a retirement and two hundred and fifty thousand if your plan living for another\nTwenty years um is not enough I not\nAlright there's nowhere to ours are up thank you very much

I'll do bombs again you can do bonds three times you don't learn as all at once\nThat's important I Know about bonds if you're getting older and it may be an option for your portfolio you may think portfolio sounds like a rich person thing but if you have a four O. one K. or retirements you might have what's called the portfolio\nAnd you might want to know about the things that make up your portfolio and how they might react\nIn different market conditions conditions like rising interest rates or rising stock market or the reverse how do they react\nI did go to school for there's a little bit when I was in college I was I got an actual business minor I didn't even do that I even forgot I had a business minor how 'bout that oh it's so long ago or I care so little about it\nOr something I got I have a business minor I didn't even know that for what that's worth\nHuh\nAnd I also when I got out of school came to Boston immediately lived on lived on ... avenue like most people who move here really it seems by service liquors\nIn the Seventeen hundred a lark I didn't know what I Want to do you know I was working at TGI Fridays\nAnd didn't really have a career in mind\n[noise] so I took this course on how to be is a a mutual funds salesperson I never took this test you know what I hated it I have to be in any kind of a salesperson was not me it's weird to think back when I had no direction\nAt that time and it it makes me sad when I see kids what do you want to be I don't know really you got ... what do you like doing on I don't know what are you into more I don't know I have to remember I didn't either so I had gone to college\nActually I'd gone to I've been I've been an operating room technician how's elbows even people operating on them\nFor three years of school and doing it for three years then went to college college was just fun\nIt was a lot of learning involved but it was just fun compared to working compared to being under stress in the in the healthcare environment it was a just a blast and that was about that was a little older than the other kids like a year or two and I\nThis other life and they're worried about passing their causes I didn't care I just have I didn't worry about I I passed everything and never failed anything\nBut I didn't get great grays either it was more about debating and arguing and the memorial union building an and and interacting with smart people that's what it was about for me\nSo they were kind of threatened things I was just thrilled tickled pink every minute of college\nWhat you mean people can go to this place called the campus and they can just kind of go to classes and learn stuffing and drink beer and not work and society is okay with that\nSigned me up people say college is the best time of your life I don't know about that but it was right up there\nIt really was awesome and I didn't even think I Would like college my parents never said oh man you're gonna like college\n\nThey never encouraged me to go to college they didn't they didn't make me understand how awesome I was I had no idea even after\nIt was only after working in the hospital for like two and a half years and I met someone somehow they went to you and age and I went and visited them and saw what life was like I was blown away I said this I Want this\nMy grades weren't great in high school and I want to go to college so\nI guess I kind of a quiz myself I'd distinguish myself pretty well in hospitals environment so doctors and nurses they wrote me recommendations and I got in and this is back when you didn't have to\nDo massively in that I mean you had to go some in dead but not like now it didn't weigh on you for your whole life\nLike now\nSo then I got to Boston still didn't know what I wanted to do this here we've come full circle I Am I don't know what I Want to do\nAs a it's a bad place to be not knowing what you want to do not having a reason to get up in the morning just kind of model of the law I feel bad when I see see kids muddling along and then I got to remember that was me modeling along not too long ago\nSo basically what happened is\nGot to Boston I was working a TGI Fridays I was doing college radio and I took this course but it didn't didn't want to do that and then the college radio became a real hobby\nAnd then very shortly in the Boston Market you're lucky at the time you were lucky because the people who are in charge of big time radio were also involved in college radio so if you were in college radio involvement they knew who you were and when they needed to hire people\nI was very fortunate that my boss the very great an honorable edifice\nHired from the college ranks as the way it was and that's the way it was in that'd be CNN that's the way it was with a lot of pasta unlike other cities I think\nSo in Nineteen eighty\nOne wow huh [noise] now did anyone than here in town for\nUm a little over ... over a year two years maybe\nI started it'd be CNN started and then I had my ... my career my thing so I'm very fortunate to have my sting established\nThat early in life and then the key to success was taken seriously\nDon't screw up really really pay attention to business prepare work hard don't screw up take it seriously you know just\nSome people didn't treat it seriously and are gone they're gone right away to the other great things that ...\nWho's going to be an overnight and then we were going to move on\nThere was a snack and\nWell I'll tell you about this nagging or have a whole minute

rest of the Russian records and you can get a premium for rent western records\nA in a communist country as a matter of fact a friend of mine in Brooklyn her boyfriend used to make money by smuggling western records to communist Poland you get on the train in West Berlin\nAnd clandestinely go to some small town in Poland not even get off\nThe door with open ... it'd be something that a change money give money give records boom done back to Berlin that's that's what's what what life was like ten\nThere anyway so we went to the record store and there was a David Bowie record all in Russian spotless pristine cover it was orange and black\nAnd my boss got me that record isn't that cool\nThat's kind of looked at all the way but all the way back home for the frame on it it's in a frame now

his endorsement of violence especially towards journalists\nSymbols and people like bombers makes it okay makes it morally okay\nHey the president says be violent I guess it's OK and those folks are looking for an excuse by the way what we're talking about it at some point do you think the president will actually have a call on people to pick up arms against liberals\nDig up arms against someone trying to get him out of office are we going to get to that point okay let's go first to\nJenny in women hello Jenny badly they how you feel on the evening I'm married yeah I had my ... I had my no you've ... you've had your ... high walk on the back of my size man\nI Know but it is I I I told the marks that I think that they um that the young lady must have squeezed your head too tight leash with ... says that it's the comment you made about anyone that can see anything good personally and Donald Trump\nNo I didn't say that at all what if you embrace their of course I Know why anyone has good ... good qualities okay if you say I like that guy than that you know we're getting to the point where that's a problem\nThat's not the Germany were precious older cats than an avid and Nineteen thirty eight\n\nReally regarding leading up to that I Know I Know it was just going to say I know what you're talking about I still think\nWe're talking about it so much we're on the waiting room mocked\nAnd an enormous enormous overreach and I think it's insulting to those pressure cells that died I really do\nI Enron is not at all\nOh I absolutely I think it is well you're wrong but that well for every once in title you do that sometimes you you can't tell people their opinions are on you can say their facts are wrong\nBut I Know your your opinions wrong\nHow can end up paying him [laughter] [laughter] it can be and it can be it has to be based or if it's wrong though in any event I ...\nA light on it I can make the case and ensure you to be wrong well I don't I don't think you could I not insulting to those pressures souls because right down the road where they will be ... you know who\nSent these devices no okay do you know that over Ninety percent of the hate crimes reported for Donald Trump took office at and basically con jobs either lied about are done by themselves to make it look\nI have I have the stamina saying the president I'm just saying are you aware that I'm aware that you're telling me that\nOkay well you can look it up and see how many of the hate crimes that had been reported have been either out to the perpetrator\nBut that doesn't change okay and your piece go ahead yeah\nWell I'm just saying listen I didn't vote for this guy didn't vote for Hillary either I voted for Bob peddling\nMayor way that I wrote it so but my point is I I really do think people\nYou have to talk about fat you have to know what you're talking about before you can make these broad reaching statements generally what I'm Talking about the can I just finished place when Steve college was shot nobody turn to to Bernie Sanders or anybody else to say what prompted him to shoot\nI'll tell you why sign as long as they're endorsing and telling people to hey I Love when your body to them that journalist that's why the bomb\nIt when Obama said that faces\nYou know that can be broad reaching to sew anything I'm not saying the guy I should say half what he says but you can't you can't already put responsibility on him for something that you don't even know where it's going to lead you don't even know whether or not it's anyone that even likes you don't know anything but you don't know what triggers somebody you don't know who's done it\nSo I just think it's I think as this\nDo you do feel that ah those kinds of statements which there's a list of like hey Buddy Roemer journalists that's my kind of guy using ... people\nI don't know they would in Boulder kind of to do this I think it's a ... statement I wouldn't make it so\nSo you wouldn't know what I\nSaid I don't know that it would in Boulder and trauma to do that status I I go I think again I'd probably taking another step who knows what triggered somebody has already clearly going to be a highly either just trying to somebody and send somebody on another path or\nThey actually did have you with candidate and the head we're kind of pre World War two German here that\nI can tell you that as someone who is a registered independent and didn't vote for either one of these people\nThe fear that I have felt for people that I Know it just sort of the country it as a whole\nUm with violence than aggression had come from the left\nEspecially it did you ever see the video of it you know that that the one in Portland now with elderly man I'm Talking about all the other ones especially at a place like Portland where some poor man I'm a journalist that jail because he pulled a gun because he was surrounded by um odd and being threatened\nAnd he got arrested and jailed pulling the gun\nUm there was another man out there that is ...\nGlasses stolen off its phases even try to walk into a building by him off and hit and be I mean they they\nNeed a young man okay so you don't go on and on wait\nDon't you think the statements by the president also Wimbledon the left to violence\nNow I think they were already there\nYou know I think that the only guy vitamin K that works for an all bad all people and so you're going to be involved in both on the right and on the left\nI was going to say that professor to hit the kitten ahead but the bike lock and you can hear him crack his head like metal bike lock you know there's so many things where people were talking about they rallied the than\nI Am ready to I'm trying to make the point it doesn't matter which side you on your on the other thing like that in both in violence in all\nPeople are naturally and most of my best my I have you admit\nThat he that this is a an unhealthy thing and that he has to take some responsibility for this he's the president is\nNot for this new young all sides\nWhy would he take responsibility for for people from\nThe tone for violence\nWhen an chief of the day that he was a ... ...\nAm it in the olden antifa too can I just and I know because\nMy running out of time you had all six minutes and seven seconds\nBut you you can't say that he embolden people from it and ...
