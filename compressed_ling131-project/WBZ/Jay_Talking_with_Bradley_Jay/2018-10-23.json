good morning I\nVery much enjoy Terry being on the I was wondering why it was a short segment tonight\nYeah I usually am on the weekends and the the guy does have a real job [laughter] so he's kind of hours on the week nights can tend to tend to catch up on and he loves stocking to the list as you know but he just did a I told me one o'clock and I got an extra twenty minutes and then I felt guilty and had to let him go\nTo so unfortunately I'm late\nBut I I wanted to know why I you know I I think he I don't think we were at all involved but I'm just wondering why Terry didn't mention the two elephants in the room here is one the the whole reason the guy was exiled or or self imposed semi exile was for criticizing Trump\nOh yes and in the\nNews that the Saudis did not take well to his constant critique of Trump and America so it's I think it's ironic that he then they ended up here are hiding in plain sight\nOf course he he also was pretty critical of the the Saudi Government I think which was the other thing that probably stuck to their raw or as well too but you're right there I mean there's there there there's ... there's do have\nSome ties in with the Muslim Brotherhood and he was sort of on the ... yeah I mean he was not part of them but he was kind of close to that side and the soul Saudi us from ... you know the western stuff was what he was protesting against\n... uh I Know the Saudis have said that that was the reason he he left the country was because they shut them down at a couple of his prior gigs when he criticized Trump\nAnd of course it was [noise]\nYou know at this point in in retrospect ... whatever the Saudis reasons maybe for acting against them I think we have to be careful and not necessarily take it with a grain of salt but understand that they had their own agenda as well\nAs a as a journalist he he no doubt worked his leaves in various capacities and no doubt he crossed some wires that made the the Saudis unhappy a mature there there is some irony in this and that and the fact that this may have all\nThis might have all burnt down to his wanting to marry his fiance perhaps is the sad part\nAbout it and I just I think the the bigger higher and he is the fact that Trump ... got hurt anybody magic that\nUh you know oh you know the uncle what it was so famous sure what's the line from Alice in wonderland curious er and curious sir yeah but I\nMean Terry mentioned the cousin ... shot I I don't think he was nearly as famous as the uncle remember you're about my age I think they there were some claims that he was the world's first billionaire backing\nAll day Oh yes that's and remember\nWhat was the movie I think Nicholas cage played him\nHow we're going to a movie buff to call in on that because you're right I Can't remember that offhand\nBut any rate uh you know he I think he just died last year a peaceful deaths which ...\nThirty years of trading with every dictator in the world that surprised he made it made it to his eighty\nOr the these days anyone who uh you know as I like to say the one who goes out and their own terms of this and carried out in to shield you kind of say well good for them\nYeah especially when you're the world's most famous arms dealer you know and but I just find it ironic when you read for the bio and it says a notable events foods he sold his mega yacht which was I don't know we're we're three hundred million or something this over to Donald Trump in the eighties\nI suppose you know what if you're independently wealthy you got to have a ... it's almost the rule\nBut I said I Wonder if that's floating around Manhattan with access show the on the back of it man you\nKnow these things go where we were going to find out well let's see what kind of find that a lot more in the weeks ahead but we're probably going to get multiple versions of everything\nA it'll be interesting to see how this all plays out in in in what the what the the big effect will be but it does seem that the the Saudis overplay their hands there seems to be at the impact on this\nBut I'm just curious you know Trump hasn't been overly sympathetic and I'm Wondering whether he knows you know he had dealings with them I I Wonder where they actually knew him well you know we I mean I think he sort of had some dealings with the uncle ...\nWell you know I I I think you know he's concerned about I think ah the the economic impact that this could have more so it doesn't seem to be the indication he might have known to cause the so give a to show he rather personally interview and as you know\nAnd as a columnist for the Washington Post that wouldn't have perhaps been a favorite profession\nBut there is a panic because they're\nRunning out of tab elsewhere so here's all the highlights of the story again I understand this I went through this a couple of times before we'll talk about that for a moment to moment\nThis is the belief a tab came across a message on Facebook it was September twenty seventh an end whites are pulls from a neighbor telling her their local grocery store in Cincinnati had been stripped of the diet soda last popular in the Nineteen eighties and now a cult favorite\nListen trip taboo still around I southern in kind of like well for us 'cause back so why shouldn't absolutely around she said I drank my last one a few days ago and I'm suffering withdrawal ... where are you guys getting hit\nOr miss white fifty six had ten can stashed in the cupboard and agreed to leave them on the porch the next morning to were gone since then\nMissed white has not been able to find tab anywhere in town this is the city of Cincinnati she received a few cases on line at a target near Wilmington North Carolina but when she went to buy them\nIt was sold out so Cincinnati\nDriving to Wilmington North Carolina for a few cases a tab and it was sold out by the time she got there we're talking about people with a serious tab Jones as expression goes actually maybe an expression that just made up but you get to play\nA friend brought me three cases from Atlanta she said those assured to go fast too it's a little bit sad isn't it is wide said\nSaid as one word for fans of taboo often call themselves ... another word\nComes here or see a tab conspiracy is great stuff\nRoom was about in recent weeks about why their favorite fizzy drink and been whisked off shells from Cincinnati to Charlotte North Carolina some speculate it's the Coca Cola company which has been making the soft drinks since Nineteen sixty three really since Nineteen sixty three that's when they introduced tap man oh man\nHad quietly discontinued it on Wednesday the company said that's not true\nOthers blamed the Coca Cola bottle in company consolidated the largest independent bottlers industrial Coca Cola products in the United states\nDevote days of the drink will call consumer service in recent weeks so they were told that the bottle ahead discontinued offering tabby in stores in portions of its fourteen states territory which includes Ohio Kentucky Virginia North Carolina and the district of Columbia\nSo those of you in New England who are addicted to that little fizzy beverage\nRelax and rejoice they're not include those are states aren't included in that list\nBut the bottles says is true here's a quote after careful review we recently moved tab twelve pack cans from the portfolio beverages we offer instead it said it will focus on low end no calorie Coca Cola Sprite\nFresco and see grows products no no no not the G and I think they made ginger ale and other things for lovers of tab you'd just the latest attempt to take away their beloved soda a steady threat since Coca Cola introduced Diet Coke in Nineteen eighty two\nSo at least ... had been living\nAnd dying over the fact that at any given moment tab may go the way of the do do\nBecause the Coca Cola company wants people to drink Diet Coke instead\nWe've been through this before said Kelvin Boyd a tab drinker for for decades who works in the cargo department of Charlotte Douglas international airport in North Carolina we know what to do well they hoarding or they find it some of signed a\nPetition they planted limited ... headquarters consumers are calling Coca Cola regular complain and they're demanding the grocery stores would tab back on the shelves\nThis voice that a friend of his approach the manager of a public supermarket in Charlotte about re stocking the shelves the manager offered to secure a ship and from a public ... in Florida [laughter]\nUh this is a call it that I like it's almost like a drug deal Mr Boyd said hey man can you get me a fix I'm a little bit traumatized\nAmong those leading the effort to keeps tabs in stores is Natalie cool I'm In a Web developer from catch him Idaho started drinking dad was a student at Duke could have been created the blog I loved tab dot com in two thousand there you'll find photographs of celebrities drinking tab and the soda featured in\nMovies [noise] I Would love to have enough time in my hands to do something like that the comedians ... Sarah Silverman\nFamously devoted sketch on her show in two thousand seven to eight tab addicted friend\nIt's like a real called community said kudos ... whose brother is an editor at the times I get five to ten emails from people asking where they can find tab\nI said I can relate to this because there are a couple of times that I went through something like this\nWho can take a break for news and a few minutes but then after the news if you can relate to this as well whether it's ... some of the product share the pain six one seven to five or ten thirty or eight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty\nOr when\nThe Coca Cola company made one of the most ham fisted decisions in the history of big business a few years back and decided\nWell it's not the way they actually thought about but it's the way it played out in this Coca Cola we have is is much too popular and successful let's dump that formula and give people a new one that they hate and let's see what happens\nNow that's not exactly the logic that they used but it ended up being that way if you remember a number of years ago they decided to introduce\nNew coke [noise] new coke\nWas awful it was an\nAwful awful drink and so serious Coca Cola drink as which I was at the time we were panic stricken\nI I remember when the transition was slowly being made visiting every mom and pop store corners supermarket convenient shop both bigger than I could imagine thinking okay we're two people really go to get soft drinks maybe there'll be some hidden up on the shelf and I and I was doing this I was\nHoarding as much old coke is I could find knowing that it was assumed to be going into extinction and people would be over the house and if I like them if they were Coca Cola worthy\nThan you know I might\nTake a moment and go into the clause and bring out a\nVery rare two liter bottle of old coke and treated like it was a vintage bottle of shuttle live feed rough child Eighteen forty six and I'm you know through such a thing but there will be very expensive one oh look I have a two liter bottle I was panic stricken I can relate\nTo these ...\nGetting back to the article says tablet an iconic brand long before ... and those are the generation discovered it introduced in Nineteen sixty three is coca Cola's first diet soda highlighted the TV ad as classy enough a candlelight and crystal glasses oh yeah yeah died so that again like crystal glasses sure\nMarketed to women who are the message you would help to keep them trim not to sexist a but of course it was sixty three that's what we did then in the Nineteen seventies it was an extended line of tab drinks offering caffeine free and clear versions\nAround that time studies in laboratory rats show that the artificial sweetener in tap saccharin could lead to an increased risk of bladder cancer those studies did little to hurt tap sales were ultimately deemed inconclusive\nTab still contains saccharin by the early eighties or their ...\nBut in Nineteen eighty two the Coca Cola company that that that are introduced Diet Coke which dampened tap sales there was a company wanted to phase out the once popular drink by twenty living only three million cases of taboo may compare to eight hundred eighty five million cases of Diet Coke\nAbout half of that is sold now\nBy one and a half million cases but to every religion has refused to give up the only networks and friends and call colleagues who advised them where to buy it\nAt all like I understand if someone who said ah\nWas shipping I was paid nearly forty dollars for a case\nOf tab\nIt's hanging in there though and the New England fans don't worry apparently at least for the time being you can still get tab around here oh and you can get old coke again too because the new coke\nIs gone forever hopefully don't you have the news every body\n[noise] the unemployment rate is that a forty eight year low most people that want to work are working if\nYou're trying to fill open positions that your business you'll have to find your next candidate from the currently employed I heart media can help you spread the word to Ninety two percent of the U.S population that's right Ninety two percent use this radio station to find your next employee driving to or sitting at\nTheir current job you'll have your pick of the most qualified\nCandidates for any position you have available we can help go to I heart works dot com that's I hard works dot com\nBubble you leave the bus WXXI K. S. F. M. H. D. two men and hard reviews the\nThere and that just a little bit more about this piece of the times and give you an idea of what people are going through and again if you have a favorite beverage or snack it just to something\nThat has become part of your DNA you do it because a force of habit over the years we don't like new things if we can avoid them\nThey said at one point someone was buying tab on line because that was the only way to get get it but they finally had to give up because he was shipping I once paid nearly forty dollars for a case\nAnd it's a lot of money for chase a tablet and it's a lot of money for kids to get a drink of it's not a kind of a beer or wine is a gentleman that said Nineteen Ninety two she asked her then husband excuse me or a woman as to whether or not you know to she asked her then husband to go to the store to stock up\nOn tab ahead of a snowstorm\nSo she said he runs into another lady's husband buying some too but there was only one case all they split what was left between the two of them because they didn't want to go without it [laughter]\nAh ah\nThese are smart smart men they understood\nThat going home to their wife without will be specifically required item was just not possible not a consideration better to go home with only half of what you would hope for so that to get together a I Can't go\nOut and you know no ... well we'll split the games will just go with advocates there'll be angry at a little upset but not a singer so this will give you an idea of how\nSerious these fans of a tab are a Ellen rodeo Lexington, Kentucky is called Coca Cola customer service during the play and started a petition on Facebook man I Love this stuff in\nThe meantime she asked a friend that picks them up for an in Alabama but he didn't have time she also said she was going to buy it on Amazon but twenty dollars for the twelve\nPack that she saw in line was just too steep she's considering driving to Indiana to see if stores carry a theory she lives in can tacky but she's willing to drive to Indiana\nTaking a chance that they might have tab there we have our habits and uh there's certainly psychological addiction\nShe goes back to see maybe they thought as tap people would switch over to die coaches said not so instead she said\nI've been drinking a lot more water ooh ooh that's not what the Coca Cola people want to hear\nI relate to that was classic coke I went through something like that a while back and again if you that some of the stories you know someone who went through like this whether it was tab or something else\nFew minutes that we had before we swap topic six one seven to five or ten thirty six one seven to five or ten thirty or eight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty\nRemember awhile back drinks cakes went under and are the ones who make a ring ... devil dogs ... and everything else like that now\nI'm not an expert in much but there were certain snack foods that I consider myself to be an expert in and when it comes to those kinds of snack foods sorry\nDrinks cakes reign Supreme\nBeing ... a whole host of ... ... don't even try ring things are the ambrosia of those kind of simple snack foods or a package of ... a nice cool glass of milk\nCan't beat it still can't beat it [noise] so when I heard the drinks gates was going bankrupt yeah I panicked\nThe same thing again I went to all the convenience stores in the day goes mom and pop shops the corner markets in in and try to stock up on and readings devil dogs\nAnd the Yankee Doodle ... of course the problem is unlike Coca Cola these things only have a limited shelf life and at least in this case I kind of realize that so I I I I kind of space lot when I could do thankfully thankfully\nOther companies came in and took up the recipes and they're all now still available again but actually it's kinda like a New England or northeast thing I think they go down as far as New York city you know like you to talk to people in other parts of the country about the ... anti doodles into not from here originally they gotta stare at you with a a vacant look on their face\nYou know it's good these days it between the Internet and online and everything else you can get most anything you want something to be said for that but on the other hand\nIt was sort of nice a little while back where\nThey were regional things regional specialties regional items whether they were beverages a drinks like so you had a a certain cache of that was built up for beer drinkers another series to be a drink of but I remember it for the longest time you couldn't get Coors Beer\nEast of the Rockies\nBecause Brewing Company made there'd be are they figured they they didn't have any\nUh breweries have distributed Easter Rockies because they wanted to be fresh they didn't want it to to get stale so there was a certain mysterious snus a mysterious so\nThat was built up about Coors Beer you know if you found someone someone had a six pack or so it was ... that gets back to what the guy was talking about here in the piece about the tablets only is almost like I felt like a junkie making deal he any course you're going to go to ... it was in a semi went west and they brought it back with them oh my goodness gracious\nAh and they continue to be sort of a regional beverages I remember as a kid growing up\nNow it's everywhere of course you can get it at the fast food joints Dr Pepper you could get Dr Pepper around here you might have gotten in one or two places ... wasn't something you found New England go down south was everywhere I used to fantasize almost not quite\nThat was used to fantasize about pouring Dr Pepper on Syria when it comes down to Florida when visiting family like we couldn't get it up here\nAnd uh so you know it it built up this special or about it so it was nice to have these these regional specialties now now you can get everything almost everywhere and that sort of died down a bit\nAnd we have kind of miss that should be nice to have that although even out of this day the kind of a hotdog rules\nThat we use for lobster rolls up here in New England the one piece wedge rule as you might say that it's a it's a ... not a it's not as a to peace\nOr Doug world but one piece wage that you just kind of like folded open up with a hot dog in there or the last me for making lobster or\nLike that is not something that's a build around the country that still seems to be something that is unique too much of the northeast in New England\nSo for people moved to other parts of the country if they used to that kind of hot dog role they good as friends would bring it up to them or do something special are still there still are those specialty foods out there\nKind of like that that'd be great it's an interesting demand makes a\nA dining out let a little more unique because when you go in certain parts of the world there are only certain things you can get\nIt but right now if you're a tab drinker or New England you're okay other parts of the country not so much maybe it is a marketing ploy yeah\nMaybe it's just Coca Cola things to start working your way towards Diet Coke you know stranger things have happened but ... out there it's not tab I've got my other favorites I understand don't take a break right back to the conversation on WB Z news radio ten thirty\n\n[noise]

to be fifty degrees right now there's thirty three degrees in Arlington\nForty degrees in Andover and it is thirty two degrees in Avon we're hoping to get a chance to talk to Jim swallow yeah British author of\nThe new novel nomads New York times best selling author as well and of course as we're dealing with the transcontinental calls you may be running into a problem here and they were open and get them on a few minutes\nIn the meantime I could talk about the book\nOr here's the only blurb I think that you need to know it says if you're a fan of the novels of Lee Child Frederick foresight and Chris Ryan or you can't wait for the new bond film and love the TV series twenty four\nThen this is for you this is from closer and you know what not a bad run out of the book\nA it's a good read one of those a few could vacation reserve leisure resistant espionage novel what I liked about it in part\nAnd get a chance to talk to be fun to discuss this but what I liked about it in part is it's an espionage\nNovel that involves or am I six or the British Secret Service in part and almost all it takes place on the other side of the Atlantic\nSo it's your typical\nAnd not your typical you're atypical spy novel but from the European side of things and the European perspective and there's precious Little America the NFL though a couple of Americans pop up here and there it's kind of refreshing in a way\nA a difference in put a different insight on it and I was amused in a couple of points in the book where they make references to Americans uh one that supposedly we really don't have much\nOf a sense of humor American stone which is interesting to see how we're perceived in other parts of world it's funny you know a number of years ago when I was working with her like a chance to talk to the Simon Cowell when he first\nBegan doing his ah you know TV judging saying when he was working for for Fox and doing American Idol\nAnd what I remember him saying is because he had done of course this in in England and as such but you know in Europe for a number of years before he now brought the concept to America and when you sit at that time and it resonated with me as I read the the the passing reference is a joke in the book is that\nThe best thing is in the world we thought or Americans which surprised me and he also said the worst singers\nAre American\nSo there's almost no middle ground the best or American the worst are Americans that the mediocre it's gonna be one of the other end he also said that they they really didn't have a sense of humor maybe he meant by that that they really couldn't take a joke about themselves and that way but it's interesting called me the same observation what Americans\nAre apparently at least too much of the British don't seem to have I have a sense of humor\nNow I Would counter that by saying I'm there are a few art forms that\nAre unique to America or that America created and then handed off to the rest of the world thank you very much\nRock and roll\nOSHA beetles perfected it but if it weren't for Chuck Berry and all those guys\nAnd rock and roll rock and roll jazz country music and I believe stand up comedy\nReally where's their stand up to ... a tradition of stand up comedy than here in the United states now it's being practiced around the world but I think about stand up comedy side of the United states I surely the British shed their music\nHall comedy the Benny Hill kinds of stuff that's not stand up\nSo case of the Brits may feel Americans don't have a sense of humor at all but by the same token\nWe gave the world stand up comedy that passing reference our founders\nSomeone talking about British a truck driver so I Do is listen Johnny Cash all day and you're kind of think\nHuh what Johnny Cash England there is an enormous\nAppetite for country music in England\nI've seen that every time I've gone over there\nI've never quite understood it but boy you get there I don't know how it may be tied entering the traditional English music at one point to another or something like that I don't know what they were saying no harm us appetite\nFor country music leader so it was interesting to see that passing reference as well the book in general man it's got ins and outs it's got its ups and downs let me just give you a quick synopsis of it\nAnd flooding meets John le Carre and nomad\n\nA deadly attack against them and my six team leaves Egypt mark deemed the only survivor along with evidence Framingham as a perpetrator forced to go on the run deemed racist against time to uncover the truth behind the attack and clear his name accused of betraying his country and his race against time to clear his name was nowhere to turn to for help and no one left to trust the endless rely on the loose civil ...\nGroup herbal Congress named after the ... river we're once you cross that you've made a commitment that you can never backed down from\nComing about two fifty here in downtown Boston is W. B. C. news radio ten thirty dean Johnson sitting in for Bradley gee we're speaking with author James Swallow the book is called nomad it's\nA spy espionage novel and it is a good one James what'd you said in ... me because a while back Tom boy he might have been Steve Berry and then I spoke with all the time who's done pretty well with a number of the novels that he has written and\nHe was told I think it was very but it's not it was one of the other authors have it on he was they were told exactly the same thing oh that's a\nVestige of the Cold War no one is interested in those books now and um you know he had great success with it as well I Am a big fan of I'm Daniel silver and the whole Gabriel along character and all of the novel she's written\nAnd yeah we had great books gripe and and as such a I I\nI Love this book or something that I read on the level of novels as well to win man as this fits in the very very nicely so that was your inspiration a job well done\nWell thank you one of the things that I Know that and even talked about earlier this evening is what I liked about the book is see\nHe's written from a European perspective so it's not an American in the case of silver and I I you know I really door or his books and the character Gabriel on\nBut the but silver is an American and he he's writing about the sort of thing is from a from a from a different perspective but he's American\nLudlum was you know obviously in Fleming inland liquor anywhere but what I liked about this book is it really is about him I six is from a European perspective\nWhy do you think that will make perhaps a little bit of a difference to an American reader\nWhile I Would hope that um that they were being trained by that I'm definitely I'm ... I'm I'm British you know I'm I'm European so I definitely have a ... percent civility [laughter] um I mean if\nYou think of my writing career straight up you know some of the first thing I ever did was actually working in American television so are the funny thing is the British rise and we have a very American viewpoint\nCorrecting style\nAnd so you know I don't think that's true I think you know I'd I I kind of cut my teeth are watching American Movie than American TV so I\nThink I Do have a style that he's you all the ... the boss or anything and cinematic so what I'm trying to do is kind of Mary both of those things together you know I I ... in my heart hot so am I ... bridge either so they're really\nStrict about reading these books but I think the thing about the espionage thriller in in any form or shall we say they truly an international medium is it can be written by this from different parts of the world because it has a\nThrilling locations kind of global trying feel it doesn't just have to be concentrated in in one particular nation\nI now I'm intrigued when you talked about people's additionally thought well you you have an American kind of style what what what's the difference between the two styles\nI think the uh the American soldiers sees the cinematic more visual uh whereas I think that the European style tends to be a little bit more literary\nInteresting\nNot gonna quibble with that I can I can see that that was certainly case you mentioned you you cut your teeth with American TV I have to ask you a ... and as we talk James we're going to take these little sidetracked from time to time I'm Sorry it's late at night might well for me it's late at night ... kicking in an ... year here\nSo when you'd written American TV what had been some of the programs you've been involved with\nI'm I'm very proud to say I have my badge of pride is I'm the only British ... worked on a star trek TV show\nAt the very beginning of my career\nUm I I got the opportunity to pitch in story ideas for a TV show Star Trek Voyager and are sold a couple of stories to that and that was that was my um my brief dabbling in in the in the American TV industry\nAre you there ... there it's it's such a shock that it really is it's like it's a machine that eats ideas is very very difficult to kind of get hauled over there I was lucky enough to make a couple of sales but eventually I kind\nOf decided that it was just too intense for me so I came by carbon and then to attention to write a novel\nI've you know boy I'm impressed\nA star trek here of course is is always golden and Voyager was a great series um\nYeah I mean I you know I Love Star Trek I mean just this weekend actually I was I was a science fiction of and talking about are working on the show and it's some you know the kinds of ah they're they're they're great people really really passionate beautiful wonderful people put me in a way to look to hang out with\nNow part of the beauty of Netflix is that he has brought Voyager back to life again right people can watch it anytime they want to any of the episodes so it's going to allow\nYour ideas to live for quite a quite a while longer as opposed to a gym hoping someone a season syndication then that's\nThat's very true I mean the the show right now he's in a isn't reruns here in the u._k. and occasionally I Will turn on TV and go hey that's what I'm saying you know and that's not the way it's kinda nice to see\nA very very cool I was coming up near the top yeah we're going to take a break for news at the end about five minutes but can you stay on James is that Joe thing because I I I still so much more to talk about when you talk to the gym swallow the book is nomad I'm a great espionage spy\nNovelist is is we were talking you hear a ring around names like Ludlum and Fleming and a silver and this is certainly fits in that category enjoy those books you will enjoy this one is well what kind of research is involved in putting this particular both together for you Jim says\nA lot you know to to do these kind of books a year involves you have to take a really serious deep dive into your every possible by so I you know I I I talk to people who are involved in so\nThe various different areas that the story takes place in if if I have to write about location there will be somewhere hopefully I visited myself where you know credit you walk the territory and get a sense\nOf the place is a place I Can't get to myself I'm not sure I talked to somebody who's been there I'm I'm very much\nInterested in what I can see that granular detail you know the it's the small things I think really well so the realism of whether it's a place supposed or a piece of technology or you know just a concept that the kind of things that you need to\nTo get your audience to buy into the idea because obviously with an action thriller the action tends to be kind of a of a a heightened type you know so\nIt's the kind of thing where it may be in the real world you know you wouldn't be able to clean delivery speeding sports car while shooting a bad guy but I find if you if you make sure that the rest of this stuff background is he doing to your readers will come to suspend the disbelief when it comes to you know the the more credit crazy action stuff\nNow when you decided to involve a directly or am I six and you and your lead character of course as you said is one of the the one of the truck guys for lack of a better phrase a do have friends or associates that at one time or another or still are involved and then my six was this additional research you had to do\nA little bit of both really you know I have friends who worked in the security services in the military and you know what I Do is I talk to people and just to get a feel for the for the authenticity so it's a small details you know to try and make it feel realistic but of course obviously it's not\nA this is not meant to be a a a hundred percent accurate trial advisable graduation\nYeah you you have to take a the poetic license as we say about\nA show yeah you know they're on the side of drama basically now\nI'm always intrigued as writers research books like this or do they come across a information or fax details that were surprising to them or they might have perhaps cost them by surprise or off guard did you encounter any that you're writing the book\nAbsolutely all the time you know ... one of the things is I Would have an idea and you can go down the rabbit hole looking for a particular piece of information you I Wonder if this piece of technology could be used for this kind of thing and then you'll find though only is it done that but also something far worse\nYou know I got a few more gray hairs from some of the some of the things I've read about you know the\nThese these concepts and themes of a\nTerrorist threats out in the real world of technological threats or pieces of hardware that are out there right now as close as we look an idea like that those stories with your finger on the phone for about a little bit you say okay well this is happening today well could be happening\nEither in a year's time in two years' time when the going to be coming out you know try to make it feel contemporary and I put this stuff and most people say well that's made that up I was like no actually anything on being conservative there about events and things are taking place in the real world\nWith the global price we have right now we ... we were the ... that's going on locally Blakely\nJade okay with that James I have to take a break for news and we'll start with that point when we come back it's W. B. C. everybody\nIn the evening and rationally for me to hand the current news from the new news in order to as a sport and you got to have\nIn order to have you gone to\nThe news I watch the news\nNews watch never stops\nW. B. C. news radio ten thirty\nW Veasey buses WXXI ... too many hard radio station\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio ten thirty with a new one never saw\nI I've had people say to me you know do you worry that you're giving me the bad people ideas about how do terrible things\nUsually the detail that they'll just have to read the book we won't go into detail but I I'm Sorry I cut you off I just want to put that in there but it's\n... you're quite right there I mean I'm you know famously a total Clancy wrote a novel about a bad guy stealing a jumbo jet crashing into a building yeah\nThis was years before nine eleven you know so I'm I'm pretty sure he didn't inspire those guys to do that terrible act you know so [noise]\nBut these things are these are these ideas these these concepts are out there um and you know the sad truth of the world is just that there are people either ... looking for white or other people um I think a thriller writer as a long way down the list of interest for them\nGetting back to the details of the book itself as I said before when I liked about it is it is a very much from a European perspective much if it takes place\nIn Europe though of course at the you know you you sneak over the United states at one point near the end and and and blowing the details because people are just gonna have to buy the book and read it for the details darn it which is the way it should be right\nIndeed this make you a lot\n... in in doing that uh your ear in France here in parts of Italy of course your your ear in England and\nUh uh\nDid you do a lot of traveling for the book itself\nDo absolutely I mean I've always been a world traveler you know I I I Love taking vacations in interesting different spots and I'm very lucky the from from a very young age my my family with you know we were traveling to Europe and to see different places and I think having that\nView of different countries is always made me\nExcited about visiting different places that excited about writing about them because I find I get I get very stimulated by new environments and seeing things just last year a visit Iceland research for the the for getting a series and I originally had an idea just to write like maybe a couple of chapters in that country\nAnd then when I got off the plane in Reykjavik it was just such an incredible place I rewrote the middle of the book to make more of a story took place because it is just such a fantastic scenery you know I thought I'm going to tell a story about this place 'cause it's just so cool\nI see I Love that I have not been to Iceland but friends and family have and they they felt the same way they were just enchanted with the place man they do you know you were somewhere where you have never been before when you've been to Iceland I've been told a celebrity\nYou know it it's like being on the planet is it is to just some of this my stark amazing landscapes that you've ever seen\nIt before we were able to connect that was just talking about some of the um the\nPages of the book that I I had dog eared are just certain little things that I saw that I I kinda liked and and what was fun to me about the book is\nThe perspective on Americans\nI think at one point there was some way might want to I was going to say uh if it was easy they'd have the yanks\nThe forest that sort of that sort of the the British soldier saying that yeah that that should you use your credit kept batch rivalry right between the you know the the the tough guy British soldiers at a tough primary and so\nYeah and again this is part of what I what I enjoyed the book the fun of one of the other references I think talked about um uh how Americans don't have a sense of humor\nYeah there's a ... there's always there's the running joke that you know you guys don't get irony you know because the uh the senior Tokyo there is a character who actually does absolutely the irony and it's a you know the British guy saying you're not supposed to get that you're not supposed to be able to do that in America care to saying well actually yeah we do understand that\nI like I like taking those finding those kind of little stereotypes of Dr Park in the hallway them that's always good fun\nYou know I always think I I I spent a lot of years as a music writer as well as James remember a another\nWriter a nationally known writer I was a you know a guy who worked here in the Boston area but talking about British Raj versus American rock and they said the British rock and roll usually focus if you think of people like a bully in rocks and uses like a distance irony and the polls\nIn your you'd be hard pressed to find that a lot of American rock and roll so yeah I agree with ... maybe\nThere's something ah maybe they suddenly be said there about that and uh uh\nBut but of course you know we have to stand up comedy I think a mix plan but their kids to have a sense of humor in certain ways but I like that the other thing that I caught that uh I like to maybe it's because I had seen this first hand in a number of times when I was all over in in England and\nIn London is one of my favorite city has\nGot to tell you but um I think it's one of the truck drivers who the the he was being questioned about what's going in the world is just I just listen to Johnny Cash and driving and\nThat's a little homemade my dad my dad to a big Johnny Cash and and I grew up in a house where our country and western ... being played like growing up in the seventies it was ... by this guy or my dad playing country and watch them so why all relate to him\nBut you know in the times that I had been over in England and and again I had been a music right or most of my life so I always kind of like a look to see what was happening country music I Know is huge in part to be\nTrue there is a I think there's definitely a weird kind of a love of the the west in in the u._k. because it's such a experienced is so tightly divorce from from the British and European experience this romantic idea of of of you know the old way to think that ...\nFold into country music I think that's the same sort of thing you know certainly\nI Would I Would open talk about how you know on a Sunday Morning growing up but it's a kind of Sunday Morning suddenly lunchtime there would always be a west and the British TV Sunday dinner and we turn on the TV and it'll be something about you know\nCrude gray Otis ends with Katie elder or something like that I don't really have memories of watching John Wayne movies well having my Sunday dinner you know so it's definitely a little afraid they're running through British culture\nAnd uh do you have any idea how your your dad became a Johnny Cash fan\nI I Know what I thought he was a merchant statement and those ... until it's different from all over the world the way the country and my dad\nYeah I Know that makes perfect sense he was emergency mean we we've been connected to a lot of different kinds of music at that point or another ah I've\nI've got to take another quick break it can you stay a while longer James yeah no problem\nOkay if we do that because I I also just want to talk about the um the art in artifice of writing in general I'm always fancy talking to authors about that what they're what the rules are are aren't so we'll talk a little bit about that and how that ties in the book and some of the other projects as well it\nIs coming up on three Seventeen

and twenty sixteen but it's the first of a series good character good movement nice plot lines it'll keep you guessing and keep you intrigued again the title is nomad and the author is James Swallow\nAll right I've been into a food kick tonight for some reason coming across a number of stories that intrigued me and some of the topics was intrigued me\nTo a\nCame across another one that has to do with the topic of a fast food you\nKnow I'm I'm kind of frustrated by the whole fast food concept and it's not that I'm anti McDonald's or Wendy's or any of this or that the other thing they they have the place I Know but\nThey do and I eat there more often than I Want to only because it's so stinking convenient and we always try to eat better and I think a lot of the fast food stores are trying to give you more options\nBut it's just too easy you know you only got a couple of minutes so you only got a you know a dollar a couple of dollars in quarters or something I said oh I'll just go with the fast food window and get something I did that did that this morning as a matter of fact\nThey restock on the times I thought really shed light on how much\nThe fast food industry has inundated our lives at least here in America I don't think you find that to be that the case so much in many parts of the world\nUm\nAlthough you know when I go to Rome and I see McDonalds Spanish Steps I just kind of shake my head but [noise] ... you know the way things are going these days in the world book can number this more than a third of adults in the United states patronize fast food

disappearance and very likely death of a cause showy and what that might mean in the grand scheme of things uh we also spoke with author James Swallow regarding\nHis book is new book to America not his new book over in England but it's a spy thriller from the European point of view based on the and my six\nNomad good book nice read\nThose books that is a good a good read if your cup of time to sit in a chair somewhere and a hammock\nOr somewhere else like that the uh James Swallow nomad you will not be disappointed particularly if you enjoy that kind of of a reading\nAnd we've just been kicking around some of the stories that uh even counted as I said I like to waste time on the Web so that you don't have to be focusing on food for the most part but\nI'm touching a couple of other things too before them but what we're going to do during the four o'clock hour we're going to shift gears and or course five o'clock in the morning Josh been swagger in that terrific W ... news operation kicks into high gear Josh if you're listening come in little early so we can play I've got a nice topic for you\nSee Josh once made the mistake\nOf telling me during one of what we called crossovers here that his life's ambitions had been to be the bass player for earth wind and fire before reality intervened\nSo when we get a chance to do sort of this crossover thing I always liked to have some sort of a musical topics to kind of torture him with no I'd actually Josh is a a good sport it's fun yes some good ideas like I threatened early in the evening to um\nHave a musical idea of musical topics since I like to throw at every once in a while it's been so many years as a as a music writer as an ... rich\nAnd you guys seem to like it as well to when we do that so he was or do after the news the four o'clock hour so think about this uh an online music magazine I won't mention which one because I don't want to go online look up stuff will be fun just to kind of guess there's no wrong answer you're not going to be\nThe punishment chastised because it's really open to opinion but the the music publication recently came up with the Fifteen best guitar riffs\nOf all time\nAnd they have to Fifteen songs that have the best guitar riffs of all time\nSo after we have the news and the four o'clock hour what do you think those are some of them you're going to get some of the you aren't going to get you may have suggestions for songs that should have been on the list that weren't I disagree with some of these I have some ideas of all the songs that should have been on them\nAs you might imagine a lot of them focus on classic rock song since that tended to be the age of the ... not so so heavily emphasized these days although you can still find some interesting\nA music ... good guitar driven guitar oriented\nBut here it is the list of the Fifteen best guitar riffs\nOf all time\nWhat do you think one or two of them might be given the shot will do that again after the

nine to nine ten thirty ... if you are listening you could ask you the same question\nSo start thinking\nThe best guitar riffs of all time what songs or the ... yeah some are going to be\nPretty obvious and before we do that\nJust a few more stories that I came across that I thought you might find intriguing that just save a lot about that the time that we're living in and most of this can just be or read it under\nWhat are people thinking is one out of Bristol, Tennessee [noise] I have to say this but these kinds of stories tend to always come from that part of the country at Tennessee ma'am lost one of his legs after his son\nTrying to fend off the Seventy six year olds chainsaw attack\nDrove over the older man with a lot more according to sell their county sheriff's office\nAll right so ... ... you got to figure out what we're doing here uh Seventy six year old tries to attack\nHis son with a chainsaw\nAnd then there's some ends up running over him with a lot more\nOfficials say ... son was only the front lawn when his father went after it with a chainsaw or they don't stick explain why the father went after them with a chain so but no doubt involve something like dirty dishes or something else like that\nUh\nThe sun defended himself against the attack by running over the suspect with the law and more according to the kings in time News I'm thinking that was probably a pretty effective way to defend themself running over the guy with a lawnmower probably stopped him cold\nThe injuries that the suspect sustained whereas as a result of all the lawnmower striking and running over\nHere I'm ma Ferguson Osama bleeding from his leg and he was taking the house\nThe doctors amputated his leg what can't you wait ...\nCan't you just imagine what that family reunion is
