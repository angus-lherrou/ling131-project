said hey\nYou guys are pretty hooked up over there what's happening you know it was good very good another brush with sports great I guess Jim Rice I waited on how to de GI friday's glass part out

for you though regarding sports should the red Sox go to the White House and you shouldn't be like this ... everyone has to go it's mandatory be the team votes and whatever the team votes everyone has to do it\nSee they just say they just don't go this time indeed we\nGet rid of the whole thing about going when sports teams go to the White House\nI'll go ahead and vote first speaking of voting did you vote early we get to that lady you can do early voting I checked out the hours ... in my town you should do that but as far as going to the White House\nHere's what I say let's let's skip that why do we feel the need to mix politics and sports can we not do that\nMore separately are the better off we are and this is a good time to just forget about that whole thing\nRegardless of the sport football baseball whatever no need for a trip to the White House why politicized yet\nYou might say well you know it's it's a way for an American institution to\n\nInteract with another American institution what really is is in space time for the incumbent whoever the incoming might be to look cool with Coolidge sports team that everybody loves his cool sports team that's great and it was ... whoever's in the White House at the time gets\nGets positive\nVibes from it so I'm saying that's just not not doing it all doesn't matter who's in the White House why you don't have to go to the White House um do you think they want to go to the White House they probably want to play golf I don't think they want to go to the White House yeah we won the world series where else that's I just want to

on\nBut I have a turtle that kind of nice because it was to hit she which is too bad because I Love well\nAnd uh I don't know I was walking whether I've been doing a lot of walking which has made me really start to dislike bicycles it's a new thing it's it's\nThere are many more bicycles there are many more people first first and foremost there are many more people in Boston and that's a problem it's going to be like Tokyo any day now they're building hundreds of units straight up there is no more no more a road space is there\nHope it's a real problem for real lifestyle problem it detracts from quality of life\nSo I figure I Walk and there are many many bikes and they they have grown to have and that kind of understand it an attitude because they have to deal with traffic but they\nProject that hate on to ... to a blow right through red lights and not once in awhile anymore it's just it's kind of a standard thing\nGo right through red lights\nAnd if you hit him\nWith your life is over and if they hit me that's a problem too\nThey can pop right out from ... beside cars stopped light as I Walk on the sidewalk or crosswalk bang\nAnd their weapon they have it's like everybody now has the same attitude not everybody but the chip hung shoulder bike messenger attitude that used to seeing bike messengers that would hang around and follow these in Kingston street has now\nSpread to bike world in general sort of anger at everyone who doesn't ride a bike thieves they learned it from the ... the motorists I guess\nBut now you can't walk you can't walk your dog seriously literally don't walk the dog and his path anymore down the river\nAnd there are these new lights blinding us on the sidewalks without apology\n\nIn some communities bikes work this one they just don't exist until they get dedicated bike path maybe by shouldn't be everywhere maybe there should be sort of main arteries of bike traffic\nMaybe you could take the center line like the mall of down ... a real transportation spine the center line make that our bikes and if you walk you walk on the sidewalk I'm done with that\nBut I don't want to be sharing the sidewalks with the bikes how about you and those lights that they have now I get it they need to be seen but these are headlights\nHeadlights is a vacancy not so much that can be seen if you're if you're a motorist coming from the side you're not seeing that like if your mind you're not saying that either so this is Mark I'm really aggressive kind of headlight rather than a defensive light and I'd like to say one more thing\nAbout bikes bike riders\nSome don't have any lights and they were dark clothing and it's my feeling that if if you hit by a ... an motorists in the night and you know wearing no protective clothing and now we're ...\nIt's just dark than they should not be on the hook for it automatically they're not at fault they're doing something else speeding and all and that's another thing but\nIf you're wearing dark clothing\nSo that it's difficult for voters to see you and you don't have decent reflect just you haven't made yourself visibility visible\nThan the default judgment should be against you of course the drivers drink and that's another thing and we have a Peter and revere feature yeah hey pager\nSkinny they shake good line rather hire on good morning Peter\nI heard you talk I have seen it sounded like oh good alone fuck figured I'd give the nice ... sure it's going to be in spirit okay um we were talking about ... time yes um [noise] ... been down to the mansions or low cost specifically the court castle I've yeah cricket\nI ran out of the area and seeing them from afar but never in\nA shame that one's close now as far as I'm concerned that was a hot\nI'm a tour guide I have to take on people\nThat was down there for over Twenty years I went for a few years before my own okay yah but upstairs and the music or um by the way it was about several spirits\nAnd the castle okay was owned by Mr Mrs Penny Hi nice people will nice people um [noise] there's a book that you might want to get it as well call haunted homes and are castles and America\nYou'll see the colonial any current good to have a spirit there but the court I I Believe is several the one that um\nThat I always saw a when it was moving was upstairs and they do what they call 'em the music or am I now though with a fireplace in the middle\nAs you walked in and on the wall too I'm nervous about a foot and a half by two feet\nAre on each side of the fireplace high so you couldn't look in it\nBut when you're standing there you could see reflections of whatever it was an American like say maybe I'm not a lamp hanging on the side I'm the only one that ... that something and it was the one on the left side\nYou're ... six one Seventy five or ten thirty just been talking about the evolution of bicycles in Boston I don't feel like it's happening correctly in Boston\nI feel like instead of a shutdown approach just painting lines on the road and calling and bike lanes all over the place\nThat key bike through ways should be made that are dedicated unsafe so that even toddlers could use them in an elderly folks that dedicated they don't interrupt traffic with automobiles and they don't encroach on but as trans do\nTheir little at a time I'm way more I'm more than happy to spend tax dollars are making this a bike friendly city you can paint ... lines in the road till you're blue in the face and it ain't gonna be good for anybody that cyclists or the\nOr the automobiles or the ... you need to spend the money to make to bring them into the the president and into the future and make it a truly bike friendly city like Amsterdam [noise]\nNow do you folks poop ... foreign countries and say hey this is America we don't want nothing to do in a stinky\nEuropean countries some things they do right like the bikes mark went there and ... and he actually got a bike ride mark you a road running a by he did the thing and he said he was in a museum and it talked about how\nThey got that way bike wise and I kind of thought that it just happened organically but it didn't\nIn the fifties and sixties a lot of people started dying in Holland\nDue to traffic accidents\nNumber of traffic casually rose to a peak of three thousand three hundred deaths in Nineteen Seventy one more than four hundred children were killed in traffic accidents that year and there were protests\n... top the kingdom ward and if you\nArgue Dutch citizens now that means stop the child murder\nStopped ... from lord more D M O O R D if you see double double a vowels chances are you're in Holland\nSo that they really had to fight for it there and I guess is that what we have to\nDo here this half baked approach or to just kind of\nDrop on July is here to try to appease progressive not working you know how they're taking a long time to get it together just sell marijuana recreationally they say they want to do it right I Wish they would do the same thing with bikes\nDo it right it's got to be a way so that bikes\nBut ... that automobiles do not meet much going to take some both thinking like what about this I don't know\nAlleyways the alleyways in the city public alley nine public housing six or seven maybe make a portion of those\nBike friendly because they're not used much they're used for parking and they used for some deliveries but they're not busy like a street\nAnd while there might be vehicles on there for delivery it would be a lot fewer vehicles then there are on the road and it's not going to be encroaching on veterans if you need to make the sidewalks narrow or\nShould I get my dedicated walking lane and they get the data vacated by the way I could do that\nAgain if you see a bike on the sidewalk time to get off don't be so when the folks ... unless you speak up\nThose\nCoupons shoulder bike messenger wannabes are going to take over [laughter] yeah I'm that's a little bit of hyperbole I guess let's go to how we in Brookline\n[noise] how're you doing how we\nWere doing good now Mr Jay a fine I had\nThat problem and what they did was about three or four years ago they passed an ordinance and if you were out on the road bike on the sidewalk there which actually the white five dollar fine now dog today I don't know the extent of holiday uh enforce it\nUh although\nI must say lately I haven't had a problem but there was a problem there for a while and these young kids say what\nA good job of sidewalk like thirty five miles an hour or so you got to hit you would be really bad right\nNow so that that can be done now I understand there's some cities are are in our country where they will enforce Jay walking laws you know if you don't use the cross or are they will hit you with a fine so it it comes down to enforcement\n[noise] man I don't know how many ...\nMaybe we have to take a survey and find out how many people are well I mean I'm calling you now but uh or where ever find out how much of a problem but it is for people or ... or people get caught up with it\nWhy is it in the United states people don't act well\nFor its own sake ... they have to be laws in fines to make them act well in ... in Scandinavia and housing he anyway they have laws rules the thing no benefit everybody like Jay walking and even if they can cross the street they don't they choose they know that this society is better when they don't\nAnd they like a better society in the United states so me me me I Would be favored in favor of\nI don't know maybe not laws I just would like it if people would kind of do what's right for the community and everybody ... but you know one person had a crosswalk is dangerous\nBecause I don't know I don't always know how many another thing I don't know how many people\nThey get hit by a bikes to maybe the polish a walk on comedy ... get hit by bicycles 'cause I just don't know that but I think you've raised a valid air show you know and\nSo you have a kind of choreography and British busy cities here because the the streams bicycles\nAre so everything has to work you know but maybe a comes down to enforcement true but that would be a function of all of a demand of people wanting those ordinances are enforced another way you could enforce an all\nOr [noise] or if you get ... ah just pick up a club at a whack\nYou have to do that but you know you get hurt really bad or maybe you should show the ... or you pick up a club and I say I\nProbably should not do that that's illegal and it's it's probably my hourly wrong\nWell there's bears way you have to have a an enforcement command yeah uh but that that means concern show I think we need a survey or maybe they're maybe we need to talk to the place how many were still get a of a of a personal injury is you know are desperate was getting hit by bikes\nThanks having to start with that thanks okay\nTalk to you soon it's interesting why we can't just do the right thing in this country without a law get away with everything we can do and it should be a\nCustom not even a law a custom we want to do the right thing and not talk on the phone while driving\nBut we're a nation of lawbreakers Scott flies we know that it's\nHighly likely much way more likely you're going to kill somebody talking on the phone\nYou don't care they really don't care where isn't the Scandinavian countries they would do the right thing even if it wasn't a law I saw it happen\nOkay one quick thing here about bikes in Amsterdam [noise]\nSeventy three oil crisis they really are the government proclaimed a series of car free Sundays intensely quiet weekend days when children played on deserted mode of ways and people were suddenly reminded when life\nWas like before the hegemony as a car you know they do that on memorials right when the because we can do that here oh no it's a free country we don't want the government
