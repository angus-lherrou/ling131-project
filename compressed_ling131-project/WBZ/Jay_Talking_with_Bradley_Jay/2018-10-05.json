struggle was going on probably initially right because initially the army had the army's had stuff\nActually no I I found the struggle starts very early on in eighty sixty one and\nA and one of the points that I make in the book is that their army is very well organized a these are not really modern institutions there are not a very efficient and getting supplies to men out in the field\nAnd that is true for the union army as well I mean the the old stereotype among historians used to be that uh the union army was\nMuch better at supplying a ... it's men than the Confederate Army was\nWith supply its man but I found the both of these institutions are just not very efficient so that means the troops out in the field have to improvise you know they have to look out for themselves and they take\nWhat they need from civilians\nYou know who are right there and have all kinds of things that armies want and need so they can survive and so they could wage war [noise]\nAll right so humans you more than one might have of the locals cheering on their boys [laughter] not\nReally accurate the more fearful that there has to come and do this stuff\n[laughter] yeah it's all though the the white population is politically divided a there are\nA pro Confederate white southerners of course there are also pro union of white southerners a historian sister have rediscovered a those union is as they were called a and then there are also\nPeople who are apolitical and just want to be left alone [laughter] yeah that's true in every war there are people who are mostly absorbed in their own lives and their own concerns and they they don't want to be drawn in to the fight right but almost all of them get drawn in any way\nThe armies more costs money you can't do business with the war going on unless you're supplying more stuff\nAnd if you have a farm you can't harvest correct me if you're you know busy with war things\nOh sure and I found that there are a pro Confederate white civilians who initially wanted help the rebel army and are glad to share resources with them but then they begin to realize very quickly that\nBoth armies pose a threat to their resources and even to their survival and the\nSame is true with pro union white southerners they initially or welcoming to federal troops you show up in the neighborhood but they too are beginning to realize that whether the soldier has on a blue uniform or a great uniform that that soldier can in fact take things that they need to survive themselves [laughter]\nThis is Jay talking we're talking with Joan cash and author of war stuff the struggle for human and environmental resources in the civil war didn't give me an exhaustive kind of an exhaustive detail list of stuff\nThat they might take from people oh sure\nYou use the words stuff it's part of the tunnel\nThan actually uh I came across set a phrase in a letter by a union army soldier uh he used that as sort of an all purpose term to describe the material resources that people need to fight a war or one of the most important things is food\nYou know human beings have to have calories to survive\nAnd soldiers want food uh and they especially want meat you know they believe men in both armies and this is true for officers and privates in the ranks\nThey believe that soldiers at war need um meet no warriors have to have meat to stay healthy and strong especially uh they want beef\nUh and that is at the top\nA and again you know union officers for the most part uh try to drive them out of town to try to force them out of business or for the same reasons but they're never able to completely stop a that aspect of the war\nOkay excellent thank you very much I Want to leave some uh some details unknown so people need to buy the need to get the book to get them all war stuff the struggle for human and environmental resources and the American civil war interesting take\nJoan ... professor Joan cash and really appreciate you taking the

I've gone to a lot of conscience I'm about your age lots of concerts over the years and I had one of the best times last night for Ninety minutes at a free concert up at the tops feel fear I notice I bought a couple of weeks ago that he was going to be that I got to go see this guy 'cause\nI have about a thousand albums I've collected over my life or not this album was the very first one that I had those thousands\nChubby checker was at the er at the top shelf fair and this guy did all this hits and all the old stuff like blue sway choose an all out to shake and of course the twist and all that stuff he comes out and to the audience at one point to twist to it like fifty different people and that was one of them so I twisted with chubby check uh last night so that's that's something\nAll right have a question for Seattle are you a pretty good twist dancer oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I wanted to marry [laughter] pretty straightforward okay the twist wow almost ... next question is chubby checkers still Chevy\n[laughter] you know is not just a little punch that little beer belly and it was his birthday yesterday he turned Seventy seven I guess he was Seventy six hours a day off but seventies seventies still has a black hair probably dying at a\nHis face looks not a wrinkle on his face just a little bell mini belly buddy from the waist down no looks pretty good probably from all the twist and\nThey look like you'd had surgery [laughter]\nNo that was that I've been people have asked me that question no it doesn't cause you can usually doesn't look like Kenny Rogers or you know what I mean it's like it it's it doesn't look like he had any surgery that I mean the guy is eternally youthful looking\nI'm all for it must stay out of the sun that's the key\nYeah and he had his posse impulse or what happened was I wanted to get him to sign the album and now so [noise] um I went behind the stage I and there was only one other guy standing there and you also had it out when I had these two albums chubby check out\nIt is buses right there chubby checkers set on the side and said the twist and the license plate was from Pennsylvania is probably from Philadelphia area I looked up is is I think his real name is if an Avon something like that Ethan Evans but um I thought he would come out of the bus and um [noise]\nAnd I just want to come up you say they're going to a meet and greet afterwards but I didn't have time afterwards but I told the geese and you're not in the bus right now so when she left they told the guy I'm Down I'm standing with you know he's probably all to against some dinner and he'll be back like at any time so it around twenty minutes to seven the shows at seven the cop pulls right\nUp to the press and the area's getting now so we wish them happy British came right over and signed the albums forest and luckily it was just me and this other guy 'cause I told the guy if there was a crowd that he probably would have just said I'll be signing afterwards or something like that but because it was just the two of us\nCame right over so it was really quite at night I wasn't expecting all that and it was really a thrill\nIt crowded [noise] no there was probably\nYeah it's a small the grandstand or a stage up there you know the bleachers on the sides and in the back and it's like a little mini like high school football stadium and uh you could have fit another hundred people in that I Would guess you probably holds about uh [noise] you know five six hundred people in a you could probably fit another hundred in that\nI'm so glad you had a good time\nIt was great it was great but I figured I pass on that but the second aisle at first I hadn't even heard them playing anywhere and it caught my eye in up in Beverly now that you're kind of up on the north shore again you know\nWhen I was ...
