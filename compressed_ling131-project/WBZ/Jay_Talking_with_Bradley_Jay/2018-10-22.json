right okay well no here's\nHere's what I'm hoping Joyce I'm hoping to keep keep it right you know I don't necessarily want to quit right now obviously I Want to I Want to keep it for a while\nBut what I see myself as transitioning out of nursing I'm hoping within you know maybe six months to a year we do have to chill condos down in Florida we have rented out what I'd like to do what we both like to do is get a phone call our v do some traveling around we have some money saved and just\nTo be able to I'm just so\nNervous I've been a nurse for thirty ... thirty four years to give up that security but at the same time I feel like you know and at the age where I\nYou know I Want to try I really kind of want to try my hand at the real estate and I feel like you know it's worked so far with the Congo is having good renters I'd like to kind of maybe flipped one of them\nEven like even if we can do and not to just kind of get by and maybe\nOne car underway era doing something enough to kind of have money for the kind of travel around at our RV and just like have our little house here in New Hampshire and travel around and make some money you know doing the real estate thing and eventually tracked a transition out of the nursing which\nOne's going to do it even though I'm only fifty seven is because my partner's sixty eight we don't we travel well and\nYou and another wait six months to see see if you still feel the same way because right now you're in the let me outta here\nYeah yeah but\nYou know and in another few months you may not feel that strongly and I mean I think you probably know the real estate's has seen as high\nRight and I don't think we have a\nCouple of good places down there now that that you know that we did buy when they were really low\nIt's like there's anything wrong with what you've already done but I think that the idea of\nBuying things in flipping them and making more money down the road is not like to be practical\nFor [noise]\nI mean so the stars they wake up once and it seems like today I think because you are right now we're in the height of like the villain the outta here but I Do think if you wait a few months you may find that\n... and you know settled back then yeah and you also have been working really hard to right yeah yeah I think I think the combination of being restless and\nAnd having the job being more demanding as long as you wanted to hear it in the\nRight to be back with you know my friends and my girl at work and stuff like that but it's like I just it feels like it's an all again you know to me like I I just don't see myself doing that for another five or ten years and by that title of the older and he's not very well\nAgain I Would just I just wait six months and see the same way\nSo that you have consulted the great article Gail and she has told you to wait six months I Know that's not what you want to hear but that's the way that charge a lay it down\nReally in Rhode Island thanks for hanging in there Roy how're you doing\nFine good morning a Bradley good morning Joyce how we'll good um I have two concerns yeah I'm trying to hold on to my house I'm a blind individual I'm retired I'm On a fixed income and two thousand nine my mom was my mom was gracious enough to leave me my house\nWhen nobody else wanted to leave it to me I'm I'm In the process of trying to refinance and my question is I actually have two questions you have the one and what does that look like for me I'm very I'm really worried about my independence I want to stay here\nHas a legitimate reason for being around their window and I and I understand that I I feel like taking care of her mom to\nShow her mom is in a facility\nYeah no we don't want her there anymore it's just a I live has it not evil tournament take care of a you know she's in a facility we get to pick up three or four days a week and it's you know the kid that we give her is so much better than the care that she gets at the facility\nSee it's upsetting you go out to go up to New Hampshire and keep your in your care all the time yes exactly so you know we have families fighting is you're you have other members of the family fighting it\nYeah exactly okay\nLet me just say this you may be getting into more than you think you're getting into like doing\nWell yeah well I I Know the the business opportunity is there\nNot not as if it isn't an opportunity I'm Talking about the ... the the full care of your mother in law\nOr we we did it for two years and it worked out really really good but she is and then and then what happened we were separated for a month because our family didn't want us taking care of her anymore because there's a tremendous amount of jealousy going around because\nYou know her mother started really you know growing up so much that she was I don't know ... you know appreciating her her caregivers\nWhat is their and their heritage and stake here\n[laughter] yeah but that's yeah yes and ... a ... a quite a large one and that's that's you know that they you know like I I'm being a painted as a you know after ... guy and I mean that has nothing to do with it nothing that you know I\nCare about her yeah and that's all you know I'm a I'm I'm like my own money I'd always have I always will so I'm I'm not really\nLet me say this I think you've got trouble with the family no matter what you do\nThat so that I said I caught caught defined as you\nDo you know I'm just looking at your cycles and they did it won't get better at least not in the near future\nSo did they take care of her ever if you if you don't do they step up or is it always use it has to do it\nI we used to ... or if it wasn't for us taking her out she would never go out of the place you know\nNot only that the worst thing about a Braley is is you can tell when we get her like she's ... she's at the facility Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and usually we pick her up Thursday night and you can tell that from being in the facility\nShe doesn't get a um a fair amount of cognitive I'm\nA speech with anybody and you\nCan tell on on Thursday night she's very it's very hard to get out of the conversation but by Sunday night she's doing pretty good you know sentences and ... it's really it's\nIt's hard it's hard to deal with it so you were taking care of before ... at this similar stage of ... of of ... illness\nYou want to do it\nThey don't do it\nI don't see why they have a say\nI mean I think you're going to have trouble with them no matter what you do but I Am concerned that you might be taking on more than you think you're taking on in New ... you'd find that out later\nWhile you're there you can\nYou can always jump bail out on it I mean that would never happen but ... and in the end there's a lot of complaining and knowing that she's with people that lover as opposed to you know high people that the you know it's just it's tough to pick her up her hands dirty and\nShe can't talk they're good and by the time you bring 'em back her hands clean and\nShe's talking now she's talking about a joy says if you're going to do something to do it quickly right yeah I think you know if you're going to do it I mean I wouldn't\nYou know you I think you need to do it in the next year\nOh yeah as far as when with mom yeah what do we ... I mean that's that's happening and that's being costs through legal or you know we've been pushing it through the court system now and I mean we're just winning everything in court now because of realizing that you know we're doing the right thing for her\nAnd then the only other thing is you go up to New Hampshire that's the only thing you're questioning about\nYeah well you know she has a place up in New Hampshire so we can go up to her place but that's just kind of make you know Jim bringing the jealousy all my family like got\nA ... you know what have you ever get to get the family because no matter what you're not going to please them regardless of what you do\nSee that that's what I'll be that's just stop trying they make you know I don't mean to be mean about it I agree I'm On I'm\nJoyce aside or just kind of science I just in the\nYou know if if there's something you can't do anything about then why then just dumping concerned with it\nYeah so you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't just don't even factor it in yeah that's exactly what I'm saying David right right you're good men tanks thank you okay somebody be easy\nWe have or do they give you a Tommy's information no okay tell me how you doing\nEd Bradley how are ya\nIt's how are you it's a pleasure to talk about you guys are you tonight\nI'm good how are you have time to sneak on doing great hold on to have any time he was born February Nineteen\nNineteen sixty five and nine twenty two PM\nAnd Wilbur now everyone knows that everybody does [laughter] telling me what can we do we only have a short time so let's try to be careful I knew that as\nI was calling enjoy what can you tell me about me\n\nYou know I mean you're ... you're very practical from places okay it's it's actually unusual um when do you do for work\nI'm actually a draw tender I Do I offer to drop rich but I've had several careers during my lifetime that on my own business very successful [noise] um but I at fifty three I kind of ... I kind of what sometimes I Wonder why I feel kind of not satisfied\nYou know what when you've done something you want to move on to the next thing it doesn't matter whether it's been that is so true\nSo I think that that I think the lack of being satisfied isn't so much where you are is more than if if you'll pardon the way of putting this kind of your nature\nI agree with that I think that with my whole life it's like okay I see that now what's next\nAnd you know I'm I'm On my second marriage for beautiful boys thank God they're very healthy and sometimes I find myself just sitting here like ...\nI hear that makes sense yeah like I said\nI mean well let me just say this relation Leon emotionally you don't want to be alone\nI'm sure yeah yes I agree with that but you also sometimes I Wonder if that sometimes I Wonder if that was spent mistakes\nWell I think I'm nuts and you know I'm I'm not saying it's a mistake or not a mistake I think it's just the way it is but I think at the same time there's a part of you that wants to check everything and just go take off [laughter]\nYou know let me ask you this um I've been married for Seventeen years to like Second Life yep [noise] and sometimes I look at this lady and I don't even know who she is\nLucy that\n... and ... and you don't know who she is or you don't know who you are with her\nWho may be bowl that's actually never looked at it that way you can be right\nDo you regret getting married\nNot at all believe it or not not at all that's what the that's why it's so hard to figure out not at all she probably takes good care of you right [noise] yeah I think she takes good care of herself\n[laughter] that's not such a bad\nAbout that yeah [laughter] shut up and start\nTo feel I guess alone\nOr what advice do you have for him I don't I don't know why I I I think it's I don't think it's her\nOK okay but that doesn't make it any less real no I'm not saying it does but I think that you know sometimes you look at sort of your circumstance and it's like\nYou know you think it's the circumstance when they could be the way you see things\nYou know what I think Tommy we have to go I think you ought to talk to either get rabbit I I think you want to wait wait wait you need to talk to your wife about this letter no the deal sea wife I'm feeling very restaurants it's probably me what can we do to fix this which probably there's some things you can do like go on a trip rather go to Jake Asian even afford I'd vacation get out of\nSound like a ...

of militant to me\nSo you know I Am concerned\nAnd I'm actually glad that we have a government that strict on that kind of thing now they're pretty ham fisted about it did it very badly\nI don't think you should be putting immigrants in federal prisons\nThat's no kind of environment shouldn't be taken away kids some kids have been separated from their family for weeks and months and they may never get back together that's that's that's should be a crime right there\n\nBut this caravan bothers me does it bother you managed to coach says they tried to stop them at the border with Guatemala\nBut about two thousand Central American immigrants swam a raft with across the river separating that country from Mexico from Guatemala they reformed in Mexico and they vowed to resume their journey and their numbers have swelled to about five thousand\n[noise]\nAnd I don't mind sending messages that look you shouldn't bother 'cause we can't get in\nA I feel kind of like a hard guy I guess but\nLet's if I'm going to be honest I don't want my life savings diminished taking care of other folks that super selfish I Know\nI guess I'm just super selfish but if that's not okay then that means it's okay for me to go and if\nFor somebody to come into this country and use my money to stay I mean I guess it's okay for me to hang on in somebody's lawn like some rich guys lawn down in Newport right I'm not allowed to go live in Denmark I'm not allowed to live on some rich guys lawn\nI'm not allowed to take steps that mine I'm not allowed to live places I don't\nBelong and they're not either\n\nIs that what I'm saying this stuff out loud and it sounds very mean\nAnd I'm trying to do it not with the anger that I hear a lot of you have you ever anger I think that's the way of making yourself feel better about it you get angry because deep down inside you trying to convince yourself that your position is right and you're kind of irritated by by yourself that was I have a self doubt on that how about you\nIt's not immediately clear where the additional travelers came from I guess because of than Mexico\nThey seem to be they seem likely to be people who've been waiting on a bridge over the years that river ordering the Guatemalan town of Tacoma Oman\nPresident jets drop repeated distress to seal the border six one Seventy five or ten thirty so you know I'm not a giant fan of the president's policies are one thing the man's another\nPolicies are not all all terrible there not half of them are not terrible I hate the throwing\nThe environment of the earth the animals under the bus I hate that I hate when I see his son's with trophies disgusting rich people rich idle animal killers just for sport\nI hate\nThat he wants to take continue to take what you have and give it to the rich people tax break for the rich take away your Medicare you know that's what's going on right the whole this is the whole thing very very briefly they've they make you afraid\nOf immigration\nWhich is a real risk and in ... in return for that in return for your electing them take care of the immigration as their favorite to you they will take your money and give it to the rich so I suppose if the deal right you like them\nThey're going to protect you from the he's in ... in Georgia on our borders just like you like but they're going to take your money and give it to the rich people don't you wish they protect you from the immigrants but not take your money and give it to the rich people in form of tax cuts\n\nOf course on the other side and the other side the liberals are never going to [noise] but they're not going to get much traction and tell you come up with a\nLiberal who strict on immigration get couldn't you have that I should say a Democrat who strict on immigration couldn't you have someone like that somebody that wants to get money out of politics somebody that cares about the environment somebody that understands the global climate climate change is real\nSomebody that wants to have rich people get tax more\n\nBut somebody who would protect the borders find me a Democrat who is a borders cause your language Democrat and I will vote for that Democrat\nIt ain't Liz borrowing it ain't some super progressive I don't know how it is maybe it's Joe Biden maybe that's as close as we get all Republicans wouldn't you kind of vote for I don't know someone that\nWas pro union and pro\nLanguage culture border somebody who was pro union and would protect the border\nWouldn't you love that why why is that so impossible\nI have a man without a party a man without a group man without legislators are all way over here are way over there\nIt seems as though you could have a party where\nI feel like I'm reasonable I suppose you do do

there was nothing in the lead over the counter so basically just the fridge 'cause that's a bummer turn it on Iran you know for awhile turned off again\nSo that's not good thinking oh something's

all weekend had a you know a lot of food in it of course didn't want to lose that food where a meal prep family we prep a lot of meals and stuck them in the fridge meatballs and\nMeatballs and beef stew and stuff like that and there was some lobster and there anyway so as time goes on it would shut offs faster and faster more quickly more and more quickly\nAnd after a while you would only be on

B. C. news radio ten thirty [noise]\nLife changes very quickly these days and things get caught up very quickly\nAnd I noticed it and I noticed that at an adverse effect on my life\nOh there's just too much going on there's a lot of clutter there's a lot of toxicity not only in the food is we just heard from Gary but in what we see and I guess I'm going to do the Gary version of\nThe what we see how bad it is for us so I I started feeling kinda jammed up about two months ago about six months ago and really noticing it about a month ago and decided to do something about it\nAnd\nLet's see was roaring a note was Andrew in New York\n\nRecommended a book and that's it was a book that was about healing back pain but\nThe back pain in the metro pain and just a general anxieties oh bald bald up and the one thing as long as there's nothing\nStructurally wrong a lot of this book basically says unless there's something wrong with your back physically that you can see on an X ray then it's about things in your life that are scrounging you up and there's a much more direct link\nFrom the mental to the physical than you might say and I noticed that\nAt first I couldn't think of any things in my life that really problematic I thought I have nothing no problems I don't get what could be causing any sort of lack of serenity here I have no problems what's what's the matter with me we started looking around\nAnd there are things things that you don't think could cause physical issues that do for example the toxicity of the environment on line\nJust like fishing and see that's see that is online as toxic it's filled with\nCash mental carcinogens it's an unhealthy place to be I don't go on it any more except to do my duty\nAnd promote stuff actually I Will like post stuff I don't live there I promote things\nDo promote Jake Asian trips 'cause I Know you like them but I don't go I don't I don't interact it's unhealthy\nI think the just the format is on housing and itself not seeing somebody even not even sharing their voice just this isolation thing is not good but the way people treat the amount of hate online is physically unhealthy stay away try it\nAnd this television\nI watch TV but not I don't do television news I get my news from the radio and from vetted\n\nApps like the wall Street Journal app Chicago at the what's the big city newspapers a pie CBS\n\nIs it's much healthier for some reason what else oh lights we had a guest on the talks about the degree to which the blue\nLight from your from screens or wherever all around us is harmful and it really is not in the long term not in trace amounts but in the short term a lot\nOf blue bright light from computer screens and television screens and your work environment I'm sitting in front of three screens and then at a digital clock bright blue like blessing\nAnd for giant TVs blasting out white blue light so that's one two three four giant screens\nThree more computer screens\nAnd had a\nDigital clock white hot and muggy hot light and it ain't healthy I can feel it I've always been sensitive to light and very pleased at a new place the lightning in general and the new place has a yellow tend to it so I've been doing\nWhat I can to reduce the blue light I don't I don't think it's phoney baloney I think the problem is real I Will make sure that I have in the background in my computer screens is a nice yellow I I was reduced to Dennis Dennis and the contrast\nAnd then\nI use chrome a lot as a home page and that's ... visit white blue light unless you change and you can get another theme I got this sort of night sky was cause most theme you've probably seen it much better so I and doing what I can to reduce\nThe toxicity of social media\nIt's bad it is on the healthy and not to mention is stealing all your information it's not free their entire job is to\nGet your information we're going to give them the stuff we're going to get them hooked on it and we're going to steal their information we're gonna take it actually they're not stealing and they get you to agree to give it away\nAnd\nAlso the computer screens and also television dumped television there's this good TV and there's bad television watch good to speak about how you feel when you watch it is it satisfying\nIf it's not generally satisfying read a book he was seen them before reading there was something organically good about reading for for us\nIt's not I'm not going to give you the old man stuff about uh the screens or I like having the book in my hand\nIt's it's just healthier are printed pages how you're going to screen plus it doesn't smell to it plus you can carry it around reading and did three small books recently\nThe stranger by chemical catcher in the rye I never read it before and heart of darkness all wildly different\nIt's really cool to after you read it or before going to go on line on a screen on the screen that's nice and yellow to find out what the heck the book was about really what what was going on there it has a lot to it\nSo I'm going to be going down to the library and getting some books by and some books I definitely feel better physically and mentally better Marty's more serene\nLove it and maybe this food thing here I'm really not a person that that gets involved in radical stuff like this but it makes sense and so far it's true so maybe that diet
