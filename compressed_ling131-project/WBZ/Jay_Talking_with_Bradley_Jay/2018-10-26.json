Medford was the bricks I guess yeah what was going on in Chelsea the chatter ... industry or services or anything\nYeah Chelsea is a deeply inveterate history rooted in a maritime industry so Chelsea naval hospital where ... today was currently or used to be the primary operating center in New England for for the\nNavy um beyond that ship building really took ... in the ah you know late Eighteen hundreds and or early Nineteen hundreds that transition slowly from\nWhere you it's traditionally think of the ship building and lumber into more industrialized economic activity so we\nWould have that if he is of companies moving towards the end of the nineteenth century we would have other maritime depending die uses an industry that would support shipping repair facilities um commodity import export operations and that sort of segue into more and more sort of\nToxic can die you know nuisance types of industries ranging from tan or east to chemical and petroleum production facilities and you know all in between\nSo at some point actually wasn't really a point it was a graduate finger decided where we really need a real bridge has long drawn out process of getting Tobin Bridge built\nIt was it was yeah um it was hard to reach consensus at first so we had these onset a lot of traffic and then you had the evolution of the Chelsea and east Boston waterfront which really induced an increase in shipping traffic see that dichotomy um\nTo back sort of Nineteen oh three they built the first strawbridge you know within ten years it was already inadequate and I don't know if anyone does really well equipped at that time to think and visit what should be going that but\nThey were ended up replacing the the drawbridge with another type of drawbridge and then it wasn't until Nineteen thirty three when they start considering a troop permanent replacement\nAnd ... the first stopped\nFor information of the Tobin or at that time that the Mystic River bridge was first conceived um the state legislature convened a a state transportation committee to assess and evaluate the feasibility of a permanent structure\nUm and they came up with the permutations they came up with the design that ended up segue into another effort in the early forties which yielded sort of the actual designing engineering effort of the Tobin Bridge\nSo initially as you mentioned Mystic River bridge mhm and they decided to ...\nAnd um eventually if uh the projects compelling enough they programmed funding for it so we're able to obtain that we also were recently a lucky enough to obtain about three million dollars in federal funding to completely reconstruct the chimp street\nNice I was wondering if perhaps in the current political climate Massachusetts was at a you know if it was tougher from us just to get federal funding I guess not\nI I it's always difficult to get federal funds for municipality we always have to make sure that we're advocating strongly we'll have to make sure that our constituencies are fully represented in heard 'em in these out Venus up sort of public discourse it's always challenging right now obviously the political climate makes it\nFar more challenging than it was before but we are lucky that the state agencies and the governor's office has been very generous to the city of Chelsea we work very closely with them and they're represented fairly well I'm at the state house and on and he'll\nSo we'll continue with our guests Alexander trained assistant director of the planning and development department over there in Chelsea WB\nCBS News update a list actor Robert De Niro and former vice president Joe Biden where the latest targets in a spray of ten devices and pipe bomb said to opponents of Donald Trump but CBS News correspondence the firemen reports that huge man on revealed no major public leads\nThe law enforcement officials held a joint ... here in New York and they finally said they will catch those responsible for the F ...

concerning Tobin Bridge or Chelsea we have a gentleman a ... a cause and I'm just in Charlestown all the time you feel free to call in\nAnd uh we talked mostly about the Tobin Bridge so far but I Do want to get into talking about trust me but the British for that as you yourself that was about you and how you became who you are urban planner it's pretty interesting the floors yours\nShare thank you so um my background obviously urban planning and design um I hold a master's degreed even before that before we get the master yeah how'd you happen to check those courses I take those courses so I have a bachelor's degree in American history and I focused a lot on industrialization um throughout\nThat course study uh my father coincidentally is an architect works or in the ... civil infrastructure around so growing up there always books lying around their models lying around us it was a lot of ah stuff before a computer aided design really took over in the industry and everything was done\nManually still so it was sort of in Merced and all these materials immersed in architecture and uh that coupled with my undergraduate studies sort of got me to it um before you go on your father was also in the rock scene yes yes [laughter]\nUm he was a big into garage punk into all of that back in the seventies or worked with uh the people at the rat\nThey had a record label actually a lot of people I Know that I'm In addition to the venue that are small record label they're released albums for a compilation at least one compilation they put out a nervous eaters record 'em so he actually get all the album design for a lot of those and uh do do you think that compilation\nHe did they need a black right yeah with red yet but the red yeah he did that yeah cool just their parent in in order so I just happened to be wearing a red hair I see that yeah excellent do\nThe right I did not know this is just coincidence so that's kinda cool you're also in the music scene I just think it's a strict interesting to see how a guy like you Valls yeah so I went to the hardcore scene punk when I was I was kind of a natural extension or your father was into which was a\nGarage\nSort of I don't I don't know you know when I was first delving into hard core it was that was a lot of resistance at home right it is I don't know I don't know I Do it for a number of reasons you know one of them up centers around sort of animal rights I'm a\nYou know I'm a vegan and I are big into sort of as a straight edge factor a straight edge factor was very attractive at a young age when I'm you know a lot of my peers were doing the opposite straight edge is no smoking or drinking but I don't know what went as far as a vegetarian\nI depends on the interpretation in terms of like that some do you did I did yes I did I went to the entire way um\nYeah and there was also this a do it yourself movement and punk rock which was a reliance on you know yourself for creating art not relying on corporate interests not relying on record labels are relying on\nOur representatives but really funding everything yourself doing it yourself and engaging the community and a lot of that influence is still to this day that I Do professional\nCommunity that brings us back to you as a planner so you went to do your masters in uh\nIn planning run yeah to UMass Amherst okay how'd you get the get Josie how did I get the get Chelsea I saw a job posting and I applied where did you see it I saw it on the uh what is an indie\nDot com really online no lie yeah online and randomly the boss over there as I understand it was looking for some fresh people and fresh faces fresh ways of looking at things and you were the beneficiary of that\nYeah so we have a new um I came in at the tail end of the old administration and we have a new city manager who started about two years ago um he started about four months after I came on board and um we had a lot of new staff come on board at that time\nAnd we were beginning to strategically realign what we're thinking about it in the planning sphere what we're thinking about in the developing sphere\nThe real estate market was changing a lot of the conditions on the ground were changing so it was a really exciting time but also a time that you know really demanded a serious and sound approach to this stuff\nOK and will continue with that but we have Dan in Milford with us I don't say hello to Alexander train\nAlexander and rarely area is going to not great great\nGreat uh yeah I just call in I'm a I'm also a from after actually a a book a couple of times a a brokerage a about a I'm a I'm On the on the civic or participated in air discussions on cars anyway\nI'm I'm from from Durham New Hampshire right oh that's where I went to a non not\nExactly I went to when you go in and says well it's okay um anyway but a show that come down to the city a lot and ah you know go to the job and British and just a you mentioned the Tappan Zee is one of the other similar types is ... and just curious in terms of with bridges now there's a lot of discussion in terms of the\nAsia show what is the\nExpected what was the opening already talked about this but what was the ... and ... capacity when it was first built uh what is it a\nJeeze commercials J talking broadly it won't be\nThe\n\nRadley Judy [noise]\nDebate on the news radio ten thirty I like this hour we're Alexander train assistant director frightening development city ... stopped talking to Alex\nMakes me want to kind of go over there before we go to Louis I just have to ask you what is what's a good place to hang up where would I go where would you direct newbies to Chelsea I'm depends what you're looking for I'm looking for restaurants and\nUh I like walking walkable restaurants local restaurant fan and uh you know music ... stuff like that yeah so we have a a big Chanel\nBuyer you know I don't need ... high and I don't even higher is yeah we have a great brewery mystic brewery low OK William\nStreet highly recommend it um it's owned by a group of locals that also own\nA handful of restaurants in Chelsea I'm the one of the newer restaurants it is notable as child pizza um some of the best pizza in Boston um it's run by a Jew or immigrant partners that are\nJust so so so so talented um additionally they're opening they already have a marketplace down a Broadway um it started as a a pastry and sort of a\nBreakfast place that transition into sort of a casual wine in a ... bar and they're also opening up a a a\nMore upscale lounge I'm within the next year downtown as well um no we also have a whole slew of Central American cuisine downtown ranging from you know traditional Mexican restaurants to salvage or in 'em and everything in between\nAll right now we have ... uh Louise in modern high Louise\nHay Bradley Hi Alexander hello can you hear me yeah great yeah hey\nYeah and in terms of um development in planning a what came to mind for me as a climate change and knowing that that area as particularly vulnerable to flooding\nAnd um [noise] I've also heard that there are warehouses there that adds a lot of the food supply it gets\nIt gets shipped out to the region\nYeah I'd love to hear you address what happening on that\nFront then you have to make any preparations for climate change like of course is to say much worse under water like a ... a a quarter of the year right do they have planks built up so you can walk around do you have to make plans for oh yeah rising water levels\nRising water levels storm surges so we uh last year I completed a a critical infrastructure of vulnerability study that looked at the susceptibility of infrastructure to flooding to storm surges\nJuly anything ranging from a deficient storm water infrastructure to poorly journey soils\nI'm One of the key uh susceptible areas of the New England produce center as this caller just mentioned so ah we're leading a taskforce comprised of regional partners right now and I are pursuing I'm designing engineering of an elevated flood burn directly in front of the New England produce center along the banks of the island in river\nWe recently secured about three hundred and twenty five thousand to design it from the state office of coastal zone management or be pursuing\nAdditional state and federal funding to construct in doing that in conjunction with the city of every so that cluster back there um New England pretty center anchors are sort of regional cluster of British distribution companies all the stuff we see at the supermarkets restaurants\nAll goes through their on their way to retailers 'em to disrupt that would be catastrophic it would result in sort of scarcity of fresh produce a result in you know escalating prices on the result in\nSignificant job loss of jobs so our estimates indicate that almost four or five thousand people are employed directly there\nAnd there's another indirect eleven thousand jobs of that cluster supports um you know we're talking in the range of about two billion a year an annual sales I'm In the cities actually recently completed an economic model extrapolating out what would happen if it worked to flood out\nWhat would happen if it were to be disrupted 'em and taking all that data into stealing it in a way that makes it\nA persuasive project for state and federal entities to uh to\nFund and begin financing some of the infrastructure that's needed\nTo question and I was oh cool answer Louise thank you very much I Wonder what you know that I accidentally went to Boston today oh really yeah I thought I heard the guy say assembly but I think he's willing to learn and I just stayed on the train like mixing I knew him involving\nAlright I missed it but I think\nToo soon so we don't have much time do I need to ask questions quickly and yes we can size up the answers a little bit okay there's a lot of cities do bikes\nPublic bikes yes Douglas bikes yes I myself\nI there's so many bikes now I'm a pedestrian getting encroached pong kinda ... and you have to as a city planner you kind of to watch out for everybody you ... watch out for motorists you have to watch out for bicycles\nBut now I start to feel like that but that is true as kind of getting squeezed out Mm where where are you on that does is that stuff you think about\nYeah we're actually undertaking a citywide it s Jane and bike plan right now yeah it looks that biking ... structure\nIs it eighty a compliance um is it sufficient and safe I Can't actually take people to where they want to go you have to increase the walk the ability of the city so Chelsea small one point at square miles extremely dense predominantly all you know people walk 'em they take public transit but they also walk\n[noise] well I Hope when you're planning that I Know bikes are riding bikes earn money for community right where those those bikes now like they don't know good I'm kind of glad it's a private company then earns money for them that earns money for them so you don't really gain anything out of it\nOr we you know our residents gained by having low cost access to a mobility option okay we don't gain financially from it now\nBecause I was going to take it out today by a biker down as all the time\nAnd a ... on the ah the mighty river walkway who's ... has a a bike highway\nAnd it was a bummer to walk I can be treacherous yeah yeah so next up interesting thing you told me during a break I wanted everybody know and all your meetings being being a bilingual city oh you're meetings you have\nAre bilingual and and there are headsets for everyone at every meeting\nCorrect yes we have a interpretation services at every meeting I'm Spanish deprivation headsets Raul attendees are all of the documentation the presentation and all that\nEnglish and Spanish um we also hold smaller meetings where we don't do the headsets we actually do sort of a short English presentation fall short Spanish presentation vice versa all depends on the setting but always bilingual\nOkay and silver line gateway project yes probably about\nInteresting projects so they recently complete so Seventy three million dollar extension of the silver line from South Boston waterfront out to Chelsea I don't know if you remember decades ago when they envision the urban rang but this was sort of the first segment of it that would\nCreate this concentric connection between all the trans lands and they finished phase one last year it has forced stops and Chelsea stop at the airport um through Chelsea it's on a dedicated right of way so it doesn't interfere with dry mouth and one encroaches on it that's the thing yeah\nIt's like a a railroad for buses exactly until it hits the tunnel right so\nEnters next traffic of the tunnel that the congestion point um but they are undertaking face too which is the relocation of the current commuter rail station over to where the mystic mall and the Chelsea Market basket is and then they are also um we're putting out a face three\nIs a green way that runs parallel to this and it's beautiful and it's one of the first sort of shared use paths exclusively for pedestrians and bicyclists and Chelsea\nSo we are conducting some enhancements of that increase sort of public congregation areas sign a job like\nYou know what if anybody wants to check out what's going on and ... and I think he could because it's really a lot going on\nHousing rehabilitation program ... well I'm not going to go through all of it but it's it's vibrant and you can tell environment just by looking at the website thanks for coming in thank you and I was under trainers assistant director planning and development city I've ... I've been coming don't have income too fast [laughter]\nDon't I don't want you to lose that your child also we don't have time to talk about this you know what I Want I Want my community and not have chain stores and your type of community could ban chain stores and and\nKeep the small business alive we have a lot of orange walk by a bunch of chain stores walk through downtown Chelsea right on independently owned businesses small businesses immigrant owned thank you so much\nAlexander rain now or will take a break I'll get some coffee don't forget about the podcast share this is easy\n[noise] which one Eighteen midterm elections are here and there'll be of easy as you covered nationally and locally from the Senate race and governor's race in Massachusetts have control of the U.S house the twenty eighth team in turn will have a huge impact on every one this is Dan ring joined me for W ... rock the boat where we bring the issues to your\nMonday evening November fifth cameras in college in Boston\nReport of our lives studio audience from eight to ten pm it's free to attend preserve your seat at W. these each and thirty dot com slash\nW these evoked\nW.

I Can't find anybody who's can even stand in the ring but Led Zeppelin but we got to find someone right so my question to you is\nThe battles of the death but what bans are even qualify to get into the ring with Led Zeppelin\nWho would they be would they be black Sabbath would they be you too would they be AC DC what are the blood sweat and tears when the\nOther and you can't say no one is that's not an answer 'cause I Need to battle to the death let's just say in my scenario who's qualified to get in the ring\nSix months having to buy for ten thirty I said AC DC I don't know maybe I don't think they're going to win but maybe it wouldn't be an embarrassment to have them in the rain maybe let's every once in a laugh at a time when they crossed into the ring I don't know who else\nWe did Rolling Stones we did who I suppose maybe Rolling Stones we can include those two bands because even though we've already done them there may be people I'm not sick enough though\nA and buy\nIn the battles of the death it's not who's\nLouder it's not who's more heavy metal IEDs who is the monster catalog that just cannot be touched\nElton John trying to think who else well how was president doesn't count gas\nBills right maybe you have to put the Beatles in there maybe you do have to put the Beatles and then maybe the Beatles are the only ones that can get in their\nScary you want to know some scary news\nThe Beatles just had a record broken recently yeah you know broke it drink\nAnd I barely know anything about Drake I guess I get that get to know him better I saw it on Saturday Night live and he was good but Drake had I guess twelve number one's within a in a year which by the Beatles records record\nHow does that happen Drake\nThat kind of goes to the previous question I asked is rock dead depends on how you define rock and how you define bad but the faucet really you know you can't go down the radio dial and find new rock and roll\nThe rock station other than the classic rock station the new rock and most station that doesn't exist probably because they're the music doesn't exist I mean it doesn't exist widely enough and commercially enough sure you can find it\nIn an extra credit so let's go to\nA break to make to ensure that Mike Tim\nHave enough time that's our first caller was from Mike who is actually a recent cast as well and he knows all

I got into the music topic by can\nA continuation expanding upon battle to the death between the who and the Rolling Stones so I'd like to do that again but\nIt's pretty clear that the lead Led Zeppelin is\nBigger than both of those but who would even getting the ring and the battle to the death of Led Zeppelin who could\nPossibly stand a comparison tests ... not embarrass themselves so there's the Beatles for sure and you have a pink Floyd as well Mike calling from Halifax a pink Floyd now this topic\nIs not meant to be stuck to its ... it's a wormhole into the music anything about music\nUh keep going back to that to be set but it's fine if folks like Mark and ... and wants to extrapolate digress get to how do we get to lay and eleven oh because of a you don't own alright\nYeah and we're vocal critic makes 'em so I'll get to the topic at hand because I don't want to take up too much time from other callers I think there's one man who could stand to toe to toe up when I'm\nJimmy hendrix oh a Spanish Kasell magic hits as hard as\nCashmere and you're just that\nHe he he did the blues hard rock he did conceptual stuff I mean are white trickle any land I Would say you could put that up against sergeant peppers Tommy or her say panic majesty's um box either the mole\nAlthough I Am more of a wish your here a fan although I think animals is underrated but anyway my point is Jimmy hendrix like they could could get into the ring with loads up one\nAlright question about food how do you say it I'm like I'm a ...\nThat are like ...\nI think it I used to pronounce it over a rumor but it's I think the ... who is on my grandma\nIs that do now what's on that they're the songs on that are like twenty minutes long right\nYeah a ... right after Adam heart mother did fly if I remember correctly\nAnd that was kind of worried trying to find themselves after said beret and and they're moving towards metal\nAnd we'd be which I think as you know when the first modern Floyd sounding out who's coast sit barrels that had an identity so they just had yeah like why the instrumental jams on that I I was a double out in the car market correctly\nNo I just remember sitting in German class in high school United ...

I I think they're the top you know often senator but I mean the doors put out so much music because it's such a short period of time you know and they were all over the place\nOr ten thirty so let's face it the difference massive and if you're going to do about the death which Led Zeppelin and some other bad to see whose greatest or ... greatest it's tough to even find someone that's good enough to even get in the ring\nNow the doors they're definitely could get in there and in contention here I'll decide tonight will actually you're designing tonight\nWho get in so there's one for the doors one for cc are\nPersonally I guess I take the doors overseas here just because body work I mean I can go look it's easier it's fun to remember the songs pink Floyd huge drinks lord man gravity gravitational that\nLook at the music of pink Floyd too and you know a ... a musical brush with greatness or I've never really done musical brush with\nGreatness you got one you ever get backstage meat Angus Young or anything like that it's Matt in Michigan how you doing rather\nHigh end up rarely\nI got a lot to say but I'm not going to say it all the time but uh you got a call earlier that mentioned about Neil Diamond or number one records with that's way off\nWe only had three or four number one [noise] ah and people don't realize how tough it is to get a number one records [noise] no ... for example I mean if you think that they had I don't know\nZero Wow Let me never had a number one record 'em\nBut a a white where you're talking about are going up against Led Zeppelin um my nomination would have to be the Beatles and I'm not exactly clear on what criteria are used on\nWell you know what it's kind of fuzzy but I can I can flush it out a little bit okay there's\nThe [noise] the number and I and and the greatness of the songs like the body of the work you look at the hands like when you look at when you go\nOh my God that one and oh my God the vow on\nAnd you do that for about twenty eight songs thirty you know many many many sons more than the stones even then it's not just the does that but\nI factor in the influence they had on on rock and how they might have a little affected future bands so\nYou get I feel like Lou Reed would\nWould get points there that others might like van Halen might not and the thing [noise] just on a show like in that you can think of another criteria also\nGuess what you said the Beatles got to be because they influence on many people I mean there are people that they have the shah was that that more people have\nCovered than any other group\nThe songwriting by by all a cart me especially I always felt that you know because they had that arrangement McCartney in London about anything that was written while they were together both are names on it but I always felt that on the car and you've got cheated on that because I Would say that\nMore songs\nThat were written almost exclusively by one or the other um McCartney did more I think that one and then on and and but what both or any of that and that's arrangement that they had so that's okay but uh I always felt that ... was a major contributor between the two of them\nHuh Interesting I've actually heard that before pretty recently during the trial and a leg\nI have um I was gonna ask you a question about uh you know because between the Beatles Led Zeppelin a Elton John uh you know the storms [noise] most of your great groups a British\nShow my next question would be who would you choose as the greatest American group of old town\nWell that's another thing I'd have to think about that wow beholden question\nYeah and I have this uh criteria for the big baseball fan too and I do the same thing when it comes to the nominations for the olive fang okay\nI I hold such a high criteria and I do the same thing for me and my whole thing is that I've got to come up with thirty song\nYou know for the greatest groups of all time already individuals I got to come I call the number of thirty and they just can't be well I just want to also or just to make thirty I mean they really have to be my favorite\nNo ... no the only got number one I'm a current news my number one I'm\nA person and\nNumber two is Stevie Wonder and I don't have to get from John are they in what you're talking about but I Love Stevie Wonder and a new job will be number three\nWow that's good I think on the individual de yah\nI bet you look at a carefully I bet you're really honest about that decision to I can\nAm I Am I really am you know I just can't say well I'm at twenty seven for this guy\nYou know I gotta find dream on I'll say oh so this this will do this and I won't do it I Know that's why the only one I ever come up with thirty ...

still think of it but it's worth a you know that's it's a love song but I don't know why it's called a question that came out in the summer at sixty nine [noise]\nWhat's the best Chicago so I think the best song as a cover\nWell my favorite to buy them as Paul I'm fifty eight which is a jam session ... if you'd just bass guitar and drums for like eight minutes and then the horns come in and do the second half and then they sing [noise] although I mean the keyboard Robert lamb saying\nSo it's a story about twenty twenty five or sixty four I forgot that story\nThat's the one they didn't know if it was twenty five minutes to foreign a morning uh twenty six minutes to four in the morning it was not there was a rumor that was about some kind of LSD but it wasn't [noise] it was about whether they were writing a song overnight we don't know if it's twenty five minutes to for twenty six minutes before in the morning\nSo that's a weird you know why do I care about that I Know well\nThat say

them in April and Chris he's always said that she wants to be get oriented to the end\nYou know that was the big thing that get ties and look at their first album their giant James Honeywell Scott I'm not sure if I'm feeling his name properly but the guitar was just awesome and I saw them in April ... paradise in Boston\nAnd they get tap playing she has now where is our phone and that's just my
