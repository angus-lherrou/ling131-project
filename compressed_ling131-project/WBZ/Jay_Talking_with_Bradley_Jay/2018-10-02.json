B. C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never so [noise]\nI'm somewhere along the lines in the confirmation process that may make people change their minds but I I Would hope not because I think the process would be even uglier\nI think if that's the case and that's the leaning than I Hope they're very careful before they they decide to appoint him because it's it's easier to take that step now than to to put us through an impeachment proceeding\nHow about ... a civil suit is there a statute of limitations on civil suit in that state\nYeah generally there is and what's interesting about it is that there is no statute with respect to the criminal proceeding no statute of limitations so I'm the Maryland has said uh the Maryland the law enforcement and said is if we have a complaint we will in fact the\nInvestigated and they ultimately because there is no statute of limitations on the sex crime that they would be able to continue to then file criminal charges and pursue it just like The Cosby case if you think about those were\nVery old allegations that still were able to be pursued and so they you would have the ability to file a criminal suit the likelihood is the civil suit has been lost through the statute of limitations or remember we're talking thirty five years ago at this point\nSo right now it's he said she said what level approve would you have to give up to to charge him would occur operation from has from mark judge to his his\nPowell well see I'd be enough to convict him no I don't think so I was not enough to convict him as well\nWe don't know yet see that's the thing is a there is a memo from the um ... prosecutor that the Republicans hired that said she doesn't see enough information that would be before\nThat charges would be brought but that's a but prosecutors don't agree with that that is in fact an accurate statement you know in order to bring the charges you need less than in order to conduct most prosecutors wouldn't tend to pursue a case if they thought there was no chance of success\nBut with the case like this if this corroboration if mark judge or others come forward and actually have information that a sexual assault a did in fact occur and that they would uh provide evidence of that sexual assault you might well see\nA a criminal charge from that long ago I still think even with some level of cooperation is tough to bring the charges simply because so much time has passed\nAnd it's hard to prosecute a case but it's also very hard to defend a case that's that old at that point so I think in order for a prosecutor to pursue it it would take a a number of witnesses who would corroborate the\nUh uh allegations and only under those circumstances would I expect be prosecuted to be brave enough to Institute of because even with that corporation you're still might\nAh have trouble convincing a jury that the charges were in fact a true beyond all reasonable doubt that's a very high criminal standard is you know\nGoing one more question for me than a break and then we'll get to calls and the question for me as of the things you've heard so far what is most likely to\nGenerate perjury\nSo that interview the text the contents of an interview is now testimony it's under its testimony on the Rolling Stone reports that retroactively Kevin agreed under oath that that was his testimony that does that therefore become under oath testimony\nThat women what was his testimony the Fox interview\nStep is that what he said on there is now\nAccording to a Rolling Stone under oath you could be wrong I have thirty seconds says in the judiciary transcript Fox News interviews place retroactively under oath staffer whose name is redacted as Kevin uh everything that you said in the end of you do have for today I Do and on and so all you can incorporated\nBy reference there is everything you said ... now testifying under under oath is everything you said Joe he says yes then you're ... incorporated the accuracy of it\nNice All right we'll continue Susan and Linda WDC radio ten thirty\nTo Julie sweat Nick says she felt she had to go public with allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh speaking with NBC she says she saw him behave inappropriately at parties in the Nineteen eighties I saw him\nNot fill up two girls so\nFar on there and try to get a little\nHand they touch them\nPresident Trump says he wants the FBI to do a comprehensive investigation into the allegations but he also said he stands by his Supreme Court nominee all the way CBS News Washington correspondent polar read tells us who FBI investigators will likely be speaking with in ties moving forward\nLooking in any way they can can provide context for that time for example anyone he may think Charles doctor for until a party or the rover home right now the White House is that they can intervene anyone they think they need to get the job done and I'm thinking of CBS\nNews updates on

during the day or night during the day excuse me overnight and during the day ... he was spotty rain\nAnd Wednesday morning clouds breaking for some sun and Thursday warming up\nI Seventy five sunshine and all but we're very busy and so the\nMeaning lots of folks want to get it on this conversation that applies the legal knowledge of dean Michael kind of the Massachusetts school of uh to the topic of cabinet and the confirmation process so since there's so many folks will keep cause a little bit shorter\nAnd here we go with [noise] Susan in Chicago I Susan\nHi what is it accurate Christine quarter trying another way to the FBI [laughter]\nThe opposite of what she said on your own to Congress subpoena counseling records from ... thousand twelve or Thirteen [noise] and you know they believe that warning that it kills the Duke lacrosse came up rape everybody believed her and she was fine [noise]\nThe she wouldn't ... just as anyone else would be she would be subject to a a perjury charge and ultimately that's a felony conviction I'm so that if she's found to have been lying that she faces a similar charged anyone else even the judge that if their statements that they've made a false\nUm that they would face a potentially face a criminal charge of of of perjury\nSay and what your specter counseling records counseling records a not a generally easy to access and usually in order to access counseling records unless someone authorizes them\nThere's a a hearing before a judge to determine whether you really entitled to examine them and under what circumstances and what portions of the records you can see because ... is a general matter the psychotherapist ... is a confidential relationship with the patient\nAnd so they deliberately make it harder to access\nBut that doesn't mean that either a she couldn't authorized it which I thought she did\nOr be that if she doesn't authorize it that a for instance if there is a criminal investigation that they may be able to access those with the judge's order or to see what what information is in there and whether it ... it whether it supports or or doesn't support her claims\nSo yes there's ... I mean she because she lives in gift card she'd be on the hook for perjury just like I think anyone which makes it so very unlikely that you would be lying\nLike General Michael ... who went to jail [noise] anyway thank you for your answer\nNegative very welcome yeah ah she's probably fully aware that if you guys and gets caught she is in big trouble ... and I would say that would be\nA motive to tell the truth\nUh and I think it I think I think so as well and I think the other one of the takeaways from the hearings on Thursday where that\nEven a loyal long term Republicans found that most of what she had\nTo say is very credible ah I think the ... thing I heard a lot was that something traumatic happened to her would just not convinced that it was right judge Kavanaugh who did it and and that's really from many many Republicans so\nUh I'm not so sure I think the the argument that this was a democratic set up and that she's just looking for fame I think with her testimony she\nDispelled that are pretty effectively a now I think that it's a question of well is she somehow mistake and um\nIn her selection of judge Kavanaugh\nAh because I Do think they believe are now and that was the question at the outset would they believe are now the question is do they care about what she has to say because I think she is convince most people at something ... is very traumatic happened to her\nRight some folks over the course of the last couple of days have asked me\nAbout well actually you know what before we get into that I'm going to take this come from a ... minute Hi Linda\nHi Linda how are you a good\nQuestion when when you say how come they don't have time next like some other for thirty is funny and\nYou know what little outside of the scope of what we're talking about now I now I anything on what we're talking about\nI felt I felt behind jak Kavanaugh okay right\nSo there we go next its brand and stowed hybrid\nHow's it going thanks for taking my call\nOf course say hello to dean Michael Cohen I've ... I've read I don't\nBut I did I say if if they have a his nomination can be taken care of of ah what he said ... guy who won the Clintons in fact\nThat's what the caller asked as has he placed his impartiality in question now because he blamed the Clintons for this um as he sees it the character assassination is blamed the Democratic senators for the process\nIs a ... you know I I don't think it's a stretch to say that he has a great deal of animosity towards the Democrats for the for what he perceives as the errors in the process and what they've done to his character so yes I think a number of people legitimately could feel\nWhen are we going to be taking care of and\nI didn't realize all the rooms and I'd have to play but no matter what I Know ... ... ... ... his Todd\nWe understand the many roles you play to help we created an online\nCaregiving resource center at a A R P dot org slash caregiving you can find resources connect with the caregiving community\nTogether we can better care for ourselves and the ones we lots\nVisit AARP dot org slash care getting to learn more public service announcement ... by ... are ... and the ad council\nWhat'd you put the radio on [noise] was just oh let's see what they asked the\nRadio show\nWith Jay talking with friendly\nVeasey news radio ten thirty [noise]\nW. B. C. I Want to play some here for you I Want you to think about\nIt is in itself was show judge Brett Kavanaugh to be unfit for the Supreme Court or just listen to this or the way he treats a senator or\nA woman a speak for itself\nSo you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know as you\nCan you answer the question which is just to the ... that had happened is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have [noise] I have no drinking no wonder why okay when I was three year old\n... charged I mean that's to me that's extremely inappropriate and what in and of itself tell me this guy is not fit for that the office that he aspires to\nThe presentation that he made throughout the day this was a particularly troubling incident but the presentation he made throughout the day cast grave doubts on\nHis suit ability for the role that that where you where you were asking to confirm him to um it was very disrespectful it wasn't his speech wasn't measured\nYou know I I actually thought that his whole defense was very Trump being it was combative was angry and it was full of bombastic and we were supposed to take his proudest stations and is loud voice\nAs saying that he didn't do anything of disorder when unfortunately it was mostly are a lot of their angry air and which would tend to say my me thinks that does protest too much is that it was too too much too fast too soon\nAnd it's one thing for Trump to act like Trump I mean that's how he got elected to political office a wreck and a judge is\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is a coordinated monthly test of the broadcast stations have your area equipment the good quickly warn you during emergencies is being tested if it's been an actual emergency official messages would have followed the alert tone just conclude this test of emergency alert system [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... and glory and we can we can look at all senators both past and present to know that the answer to that is is absolutely not but but for whatever reason we keep electing people like this in spite of the reason I think some would argue we're in the trouble we're in is that\nPoliticians don't change and ah we keep electing them and that's you get the government to deserve at the end of the day right\nRoger I Will agree with you let's kick him off the committee and everyone should vote him out\nThat you're absolutely right\nMoving on its Robin ...\nRob how're you doing where I live I mean you guys doing good how are you tonight at a couple of questions about the woman that testified against a [noise]\nA Kevin doctor Dr Ford Ford okay\nUm first of all the crime that that this is that it was it was really committed their jurisdiction that wouldn't that be the the local police in Maryland yes so why wasn't there an investigation open up\nFor them on this\nThey said they don't have a complaint that if they have a complaint from her they will open investigation but obviously over the course of the first thirty five years there's been no direct complained to them\nI find that that would be very very strange to\nYou hold on do you mean it's odd because someone didn't come forward for all that time right All right let me address that I'm Glad you brought that up and down in the church scandal uh there are men for thirty five years didn't say anything and they came forward ...\nFor whatever reason and we didn't have any of folks impeaching their claims because it took so long there are lots of reasons it took so long these people the priests were in power\nOr the people were ashamed and this argument that I hear made over and over and over again but that argument for saying exact reason that the people didn't come forward and the church scandal\nAnd I had a desire to boring now that I decided\nTo come forward to the Washington Post but go to the to the police were but\nThey they the you know what the evidence does suggest that most sexual assaults go reported right I mean and and if you ... you know I asked my daughter about this and I've asked my students about it how common is this type of behavior where you have to ward off unwelcome sexual advances oh you are your friends\nAnd the answer is shockingly\nIt's a very common occurrence [laughter]\nIf you don't want to believe this woman that's fine with me and I didn't want to re signed the fact that I didn't I didn't based on the fact\nThat you didn't come forward for a long time that's fine but I'm not going to sit here and let you demean\nThe people who are come coming forward after all these years because you as a man can't understand why they didn't come forward we've gone over that and over that and over that it's tiresome so now we're going to move forward to ... Weymouth I Do\nHave good how are you today\nThis might be kind of a stupid question but I got to ask it anyways so suppose after he gets the nomination you have any chance that any of his previous cases will be overtime I found out it was a substantial information [noise]\nNow that's an interesting question I had I hadn't really thought of that sometimes there is a problem with respect to\nThe fact that not likely is the short answer to the question are you would have to look to see whether some of the ones he's decided we could now be called into question\nBecause of whatever comes up during the investigation such that his impartiality could be reasonably questioned it's hard to think in the abstract what such a situation might be\nUm but it but again he's decided an awful lot of cases a lot of them are a government and business cases\nBut I could see where you could have a allegations that come to do do do\nA ... that are supported through the investigation\nThat you could argue than that he should have recused himself in these earlier cases and now that we have this evidence or those decisions ... should be revisited I I think it's a stretch but I think it's I think it's an interesting point and it's it's a\nIt's far from far from a a stupid or unnecessary question because you know lawyers will in fact look two ways to set aside his earlier decisions if in fact this this blows up as it just might\nExcellent fishing boats that badly it and you generally have a good morning\nAlright Joe villain Weymouth okay six one Seventy five or ten thirty seven it'd be easy but going to get some news here get some water have half a muffin or something and we would rejoin you\nFor a second half with dean coin dean of the Massachusetts school of law it's W.

dust suitable for the place we should not play politics\n[noise] thank you very much Eugene and acts but take care and to continue with what you do you have anything to I have\nI mean you genes point is that it there are there were four judges on the short list\nAll of who were conservative very conservative\nOtherwise Trump wouldn't be pointing them there there's a federal judge who was on the list to one would say well it's a little less clear but he certainly wasn't a liberal\nAnd that really is the question I think that Eugene raises that people should answer no matter who is the point that it's going to be conservative does he have to have the baggage that many see judge Kavanaugh are as having now with respect to the alcohol the potential abusive women\nUm in in his credibility issues in temperament issues you know a box for the midterm elections coming up\nUh I think the Republicans would be very hard pressed to support it but what they don't want to do is go into those elections looking ineffective and unable to accomplish one of the principal aims to the supporters which is to put a voice on the Supreme Court that that could put roe versus Wade in question\nOr the way one of the five and all this was a woman who's really conservative\nAmy Barrett I Wonder why they didn't go with that\nWell and I think there's two women actually the other one is a judge Larson from the ... circuit or both of who are conservative\nAre both in teaching in their writings and in the decisions\nUm and and um I don't know why he didn't go and the other thing is they would have brought more diversity to the bench because virtually all of the Supreme Court justices from either Harvard or judge Kavanaugh will be from Gail in really to law school is for the most part other than a judge Ginsburg\nReally control the court and have been for decades\nAll of the others on the shortlist including the two new other females that I just mentioned um\nWould have diversified the caught a little bit a from a standpoint of educational background as well as gender [laughter]\nTo people who go to the hot seat the you know the ... prep schools\nLike Georgetown Prep do they have a shorter faster more short track to the high jet jet ships\nUndoubtedly undoubtedly if one looks at the\nUm the pedigree of the federal judiciary\nA ... you're really talking about a few of the very very elite law schools that dominate those rankings and obviously when we look at the Supreme Court it's Harvard and Yale or and that's not uncommon and did does does privilege habits benefits both\nI'm In the ah legal profession as well as virtually every other and the answer is yes and it's there is some concern about this being a fat fast track just success and some have argued that that sense of entitlement was clear in\nIn ... that was one of my main beef why did he have to keep reminding me that he went to the best prep school will just to make sure you know he's better than you [laughter] and back to\nJust to address another reason that women and men don't come forward right away\nOr let's say someone had been to let's say someone had been abused that someone has to decide if it's worth it to\nMake something out of it as suffer the shame self doubt everyone hating them\nThe parents and in many cases the\nRisk ward is just not worth it however if the person that allegedly abused you\nAll of a sudden is in line to be on the Supreme Court you might feel a moral obligation civic duty to speak up it's not fun did you notice the big giant guy back behind her\nWhen she was

three times before he leaves so dean going David Noel is with us Hi Dave\nHi Bradley fighting Michel dean calling\nOr being Michael coin or Justine you can\nCall me Michael you can call me being ... and call me professor calling could call me whatever you'll his position is his name as my time\nI'm just going to call you all around good guy [laughter] yeah that appreciate that bank you know you are you are you\nTake it a lot of time out of your life time I come out here in the middle of the night and satisfy a lot of questions on on the legal ...\nI did I enjoy coming down spending the night with mocking Bradley\nHere you are your are generally thank God but anyways um\nTwo two things first is um the um thank God for like coming up with a um a some type of a a spine and and and in stopping this railroad\nAnd unlike like she said as I don't want to get in front of a trainer but you're going to run me down and that's what's happening\nOr that's what was happening that day no\nThose ladies I mean if you if you call that a a kidnapping whatever it didn't look like could map it looks like he's going to start crying\nYeah he looked very embarrassed by the whole thing and it looked like it was touched looked like he was touched\n... how could you not be touched a lady's crying saying how she was raised in it and and you know letting the you know it's it's nothing right is something to the person that happens too but what happens is\nThey get the sense of ties because they they cut people's heads up all the time that's their job or the son of the you know sixty people are happy with something and party people\nDon't want it and and they go they satisfied sixty percent of the population then it's like one thing after another\nIt's possible position but that's my point on that but what I was dying to ask you one more time what does a\nA per hour uh-huh\nFor legal cross right yup that the ... the lowest per se the last you know I'm sitting at a lawyer will cross try to the highest the is it you know I've heard people say five thousand dollars in Iowa\nI've never known anybody but I heard five hundred dollars an hour before her nuts are more common yup I'll call them out but I heard like fifty dollars and not\nYet on hundreds of public service lawyers committee for public counsel in the like you could be talking fifty to Seventy five dollars an hour\nThey're paid for by by the state and the like but private lawyers you would see private lawyers depending on how long they've been practicing law that type of area they practice in in the like\nAnd there's just a specific skill could really run anywhere from a hundred dollars an hour to two thousand dollars an hour I have not heard a range up to five thousand but\nIf the market will bear it I'm sure someone would charge but that sounds a little high but I haven't heard a lawyers now and for the longest time you didn't see the thousand dollar an hour I'm number or reach but now there are some lawyers long experience with a special skill\nThose that you would you could get up to a two thousand dollars an hour really in that one to two in the range but that's a lot of experience in a real specialty\nRight right and that's a guy that's probably going to make a lot better about what are you doing\nI'm going to go ahead and move along Dave thank you day okay and that was Betty and the boat Barry hello\nHow are we are well and we're short on time\nI Know I have a couple of questions\nOn if a person goes to a doctor or lawyer and late ... and they killed on the shelves they're responsible for self reporting\nThe same because as if um I went to a doctor and I said well somebody right they they have to self that they have to put that into that\nAnd it's just just now Massachusetts or is this a federal law\n[noise] I'd a true you have to report past things or do you only have to report if there is a threat\nYeah I don't I don't know that the assumption within your question is accurate that you would have to have to report that information either as a doctor or lawyer that a past events took place along those lines\nWhat's the other question Betty\nMy question is can you explain to me that Jeff ... battery and solved\nYet they're actually they they don't uh they're not as intuitive is some would think the battery is the actual hitting the batter think about getting you know the the batter hits the ball if you want to try and remember it that way\nWe're in a salt is actually the threat to do the hum it's the the words more likely a constitute the assault the battery is the actual infliction of the physical injury\nCame my question is is this Congress to pass that have an Irish not suited for the court can they go back to Clarence Thomas and said turn in your own ...\nUh that's a it's an interesting question no if they don't go there if they want to remove Thomas it would be by the process of impeachment\nUm and and you know it is interesting corollary as to whether they they they may regret how that was handled now and especially when viewed through today's lens it it really looks ugly\nOr but if you want to take comments off the Supreme Court it would be by way of impeachment and you would have to show that he's committed you know high crimes and misdemeanors when we're looking at\nA well the president but when we're looking at others you'd have to show that their their their criminal activity that they've committed no longer means is suitable for the bench and and we have had judges even in recent history removed by way of impeachment I think a West Virginia just removed for\nA or a or a number of\nThe Supreme Court justices for malfeasance\nThank you very excellent call Betty and I'm done here because we only have thirty seconds and I always wanted to make sure we give you that the side of the ... thank you so much for coming out is always such a\nBoth as stimulating intellectual and fun time that's always fun I appreciate and up to ah the school Massachusetts school of law coming up\nIs talked to vote with Dan right and you're selling some other luminaries ... okay thank you very

W ex ... two men for an eye heart radio station\nIt doesn't matter to me it's just as I'm as an observer I Would I'm surprised they're pressing this because I think that it will\nBe\nHarmful to the court in general and probably more importantly into the Republican Party harmful to the Republican Party because it's going to be a\nReal source of motivation for their\nTheir enemies that competitors the Democrats it's going to\nInflame and energize them\nWhy not just get another judge is it a matter of pride maybe as a matter of feeling bad for for judge Kavanaugh I I don't I don't feel bad for him after his behavior I don't I don't feel bad for him if he goes\nDown it probably won't be for\nThe initial allegations I have no idea who's telling the truth I have no idea\nIf he did what she said says he did I just don't know but now I we're getting to the point where there are other things that will be more likely to determine his fate\nAnd that would be sued ability or lying to Congress when it comes to suit ability please listen to this ... let me back up just a bit\nI Need you all every week that it's on to watch both real time with Bill Maher\nAnd\nLast week tonight with John Oliver ... you need to watch them because they're funny they're excellent\nPart you need to watch them for example Bill Maher interviewed debated with Steve Bannon this time and it was something that every American every voter needs to say\nIt's important to hear what Bill guys like Bill Maher say and it's important to hear what Steve Bannon said I have to tell you I've never really seen an exchange like that would ban and and I was impressed and actually gave me a little bit of hope\nAnd I think that\nYou all should watch it one thing you did say to say that resonated with me is to pay no attention\nTo Trump's flash bang grenades which means basically don't pay any attention\nYou know what he says and a lot of the things that bother me other things he says so ... and I can understand that I just ignore the things he says and just go by what he does and maybe the good things will mount up\nLike this NAFTA deal if it is as good as I Hope it it's going to be\nMaybe he'll be right all about a lot of stuff fine so if you're able to and they're both HBO but you can get 'em on YouTube\nReal time was Bill Maher one of the best programs on and last week tonight with John Oliver outstanding stuff\nBack to the judge and I told you now I I met in an area of suit ability\nAnd John all over really drill down on kind of awareness of judge Kavanaugh first I spoke to\nDean Michael Corner of the Massachusetts school of law about whether or not it was normal for a person to keep their calendars for thirty five years ago and said no that is well he didn't say it's twisted he says that's not normal I'm going to say that's twisted I Do understand that\nAttorneys keep things a long time to keep records they have ... and stuff that happened a long time ago I get that\nMuch of personal calendar for that long and then to get we be when you talk about it\nAnd you can kinda understand that if maybe\nThe father who kept in turn you on to keep in calendars has passed away or having moments like memories of your past um father but he's not he was in the room sitting there behind him I was weird is something wrong or something really wrong\nThen there's this the treatment\nOf well particularly\nA female inquisitive there who just in a very straightforward way asked her about\nLook you've been accused of something perhaps in you know we need to know if you drink tea a blackout because if you drink the blackout there's a possibility you did this ... and they don't remember it she didn't say all that she just asked about his blacking out which is legit in this case\nThis was his answer to me this is this is the thing that makes them unsuitable\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before a part of what happened\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you [noise]\nCan you answer that question catch and it's just the ... that found happened\nIs that your answer yeah and I'm curious if you have [noise] I Am not drinking or gay\nSo I'm curious if he'd say that to a man I think that hey this was a complete disrespect for women complete disrespect former secondly complete disrespect\nFor the proceedings and somebody will say well they should be respected because it's a railroad it's which aren't uh no actually you need to\nRespect you should say you should you should proceed like\nBill Bill a check for the answer would just say no I never have and then in a fire to weigh it didn't need to be a smart alec what's that about absolute disrespect absolutely\nNon judicial behavior ... that was a problem real real problem for me and again\nThis is just me being personally irritated that says nothing to do with whether he'd be a good judge but the insistence on mine owing and everyone out there knowing if he went to the ... prep schools I went to school and I went to that school and I was playing football I did this and I did that\nAnd I have this great job okay do I get it get it that doesn't mean that\nIf there's no bearing on on whether or not you were involved in this kind of thing than bad things happen at prep schools St Paul's for example\nSo I found them to be just for me while the irritating I don't like him I Would I Want to hang around with somebody is arrogant and titled unspoiled he seemed to me to be quite frankly bitter I kinda spoiled because he wasn't getting his way and he was just a pet ... little kid\nWho was lashing out because for once in his life he didn't get his way\nSo it would be a good judge no idea\nDo do I like him though remain smart thing to do for this for me this is my thing for the party to do for the president to to be say hey you know what I'll kill two birds with one stone I Will get rid of this motivating factor for my opponent\nAnd I will put a woman on I Will I Will\nNominate a woman instead they're a couple and the lists that are very conservative and would probably do a fine job\nIt'd be so smart for him to do that I don't really know I didn't do that in the first place maybe new that\nJudge Kavanaugh was belligerent like this and just likes belligerent dude that could be you maybe he relates that's fine that's totally fine that's not me putting them down that might be just why\n\nSo there we go six one Seventy five or ten thirty decorative easy one of ... if you'd like to follow it but that that's cool\n\nAnything that the deans said talked about is definitely something we can continue if he was great to have you ever because he had he had the skinny on a ... on the legality of this\nHe says if I remember would if I correctly understand the inclines was the position as if something goes wrong for Kevin uh it's probably won't\nBe the initial allegations but instead will be his behavior and statements sense\nIt's W. busy news radio ten thirty\nTalking privately say who is this\nHad Lee J J talking ... news radio ten thirty\nTo get your school involved

and you can win quaint\nYou have the ... you have whether or not they internalize your weather out the incident took place and then you'll have separately was did they play games to maximize the impact of the incident I have no idea who to believe I don't have any idea\nAll prosecutors everybody says that they would never ever bring it to court she has no proof no evidence nothing she doesn't even know where it happened\nFair enough I as you you may have ... um\nHeard me say friday or calling I have no idea who\nWho's selling the truth though you're right you're right nobody does and\nI'm just kind of focusing on\nThe\n... they are also if it's somebody accused you of something and if it wasn't she'll be appalled\nThat would be appalled and I would I Would uh I we've been ...\nYou wouldn't react differently than someone else may be somebody making accusations and the other thing is this whole thing against Kavanaugh said that they didn't treat him the same way that they traded true\nWith all the questions and everything she was she was treated very well but Michel woman but when it was time for him they were calling them names but I'm a plot and everything called the ... in in in a boarded up\n... hip college isolate it for the way he did it because it did come across as political but\nI thought that it came just across this kinda disrespectful nor do I okay thank you let me play the whole thing for you so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nThat you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you [noise]\nCould you went to the question which is just to you that's not happened is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have [noise]\nI have no drinking nor do I okay thank you [noise]\nBy the way the ride the wave I did that said that under oath we'll see if we only have to have that\nThe reason they did that if he says yeah flick though before then they'll say how do you know you didn't blackout in that room right that's the reason they did\nYes of course\n[laughter] yeah why is it why is that funny\nI I you know they kept trying to trap him you know ... and then bring it up as a book you know when people put things in the book it put a lot of stupid things and\nYou know ... to ... you know for them to even bring it up I don't see how they're going to solve it one way or the other how they're going to prove whether or not it happens you\nKnow I don't think they are\nYou know I just can't see it again either you know but uh

anybody and the scene is turned sour it's bad you can just step right out your home free but if you are ... more of a mall location\nA ... you know should people factor that into account where if something goes shower I have my out on this work and just step out of it quickly\n\nAnd what are you asking me if I agree with that very\nWell well well well what do you think of that though right now from our story she needed to get right out of that house and get a ride in the dark or at home ... miles and miles away\nSo should people be more careful about putting themselves and and what to say it's a group of strangers to where if something goes bad on the scene where they can quickly get out and get society\nI guess that makes sense as a good policy wise policy yeah absolutely yeah and
