I have no idea what else was in that debate I didn't listen to it I didn't watch it\nBut it became it became clear to me when I read the globe the small down and I listen to the newscast and W. busy this morning that that really was the big story and that is the yeah the amount of that debate\nAnd I totally agree and I was at work so I Can't I I was watching it either but I had heard about that I like that that the town where\nYou have to you later you have to wonder yeah there might\nBe some deal voters out there who are going to get bigger a little differently as a result I don't know thanks thanks\nWe'll talk soon OK okay Hannah that right now let's go to Mike Little ... we're going from the down by the Cape ... north to Mike and drink and have my next door nights on how are you tonight\nThen I'm good how are you\nAre doing just great uh let's get your reaction first of all to uh the again I'll call it bakers stumbled yesterday um and and the lack of his staff getting him ready for it easily foreseeable question I'm\nOn [noise] unfortunately I did not get to see or hear that yet I like\n... I'm going to play for you right now this is Jay Gonzalez or asking governor Baker is he's going to vote for Jeff deal who's the Republican Senate candidate in easily foreseeable question and the governor was ... he seemed to be stunned by it\nAnd if you you Jim rowdy who was the one of the moderators in on the debate a then prompted you'll hear him say governor and then he still even at that point doesn't recover when he wins the debate was over he did say\nThat to the press gag oh younger votes to the media guy going going to vote for Jeff deal but this was a a a pretty ah it wasn't his find this moment let me put it like that here we go down there and you're going to vote for Jeff deal\nGovernor I'm going to vote for me and I'm going to vote for ... you know that I'm going to\nVote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do you expect to that one\nThat was that the government that's that is what the ... ... what the governors stumble was and clearly he ... he I shouldn't say corrected himself he amended that state then shortly after the debate to say he was voting for Jeff deal but\nThat was a pretty ... response\nI agree I'm Wondering if he actually doesn't plan on voting Jeff deal\nUm you take you take him at his word I was I think so so my question to you is this your advice for either just deal Elizabeth Warren when they meet tomorrow night for the first time in face to face to be\nMy advice to would be that Jeff deal and um I may not be as politically adept as the previous caller but I agree with her and a lot of ways I Would say that deal to\nJust do hold us to keep his cool don't resort and mudslinging I think she's got plenty of money in our face as it is uh just play a game like I said just keep it\nCool okay and do it that way and I think that would be that was her best so we're going to vote for Senator Warner deal I Am going to be voting for deal and what about for the governor's race\nA I have not decided if I'm going to vote for ... hours but I Will not be voting Charlie Baker you so much like taking a split as well and I'm also an independent only as a little bit right and I just don't trust Charlie Baker I don't know that he's done a lot of really good things\nSo I guess I get you down as a question mark and the government is ... and the governor's race to be determined is a DVD All right Thanks Mike All right thank you have a great and I do not okay let me get one more in here at least a gigs in a way of doing\nGood how are you doing there\nAre doing great we've got only a couple of minutes

again when I Need to do is\nWalk it off and so I'm trying to figure out exactly how to do it now there's two problems there are the open gaps that just a cursor around the edges no matter how you\nAre tightly things that like the window sill on either side to Sasha on the top on underneath is always\nGaps never going to fill those in\nOn their own and then of course since sessions up some those those gaps and it's just too much of a pain to try to put stuff in all those gaps so I Need some macro solution and I and\nHave done those three am Shrink Rap double sided type things and they were pretty well this is kind of big I envision this\nSolution where I took a big sheet of Styrofoam as big as the entire window bigger than the entire winter sword extends out to the mood parts\nAnd then cut a hole exactly exactly the size of the air conditioner so which deals everything off except the events of the air conditioner everything somehow it sealed I don't know and then for the part of the year comes just stick it out that's easy enough you just\nYou they have coverage for that because one thing that kind of\nGoes over everything I don't know if it's Styrofoam or some sort of insulating

Love them and I need to learn to do that\nRight you know I Wish Ryan you know would take me under his wing he's the guy that help people like bought out but we extend their careers with our brain you know you do wouldn't be what they are now\nHe can take a you can take somebody and make them do things to get them out of their own had any way you want me to tell you I'm going to tell you about how the music gets made that you're reading and the reason I'm telling you this is because you can do it you can do it\nYou gotta\nIf you're by yourself you're going to need to have an open minded about computers you're going to need a pretty good computer laptops fine\n[noise] and you're going to need an interface an interfaces thing is something that say you have a guitar you plug your guitar into it and then that sends it into the computer\nAnd also converse the ... the regular analog ... guitar into digital it gets it into your\nSoftware your editing software\nThere are a bunch of them this Pro Tools this logic from apple there are others adobe and what it is is a you open it up and then create track how many you can create as many tracks as you want and you\nSign an input to that track like over when I got my guitar plugged into in the interface and hit record and play\nSame with ... or any instrument\nThere's two kinds of tracks well there are more than two kinds of tracks but the two main kinder an audio track which is when you play a real guitar in and records it or a software track where it plays a software instruments\nWhen I'm Talking about when I say software instrument let's take drums for example or synthesizer let's let's take a synthesizer for now software instrument you will you create new track\nChoose software poof it opens up then you choose the software instrument you won the software instrument is a program that either exist on the computer already on you but\nI like a thing called ... many v which is a a software version of a mini look I'm a mini move an actual mood\nHas the interface appearance of the movie and it has sounds like a move and it has when you turn the knob sonnet those knobs do the same thing as they would do on a real moot synthesizer [noise]\nSo you open the mood and you want to play an actual keyboard okay you have a ... called ...\nOr a controller is just a keyboard that doesn't do anything except control it's usually a USB you play you plug it in the software sees it and so you play the keyboard and it activates the software just like you're playing them with the keyboard\nAnd so you you can play a piano hit record play in there\nAs far as drums since I'm Talking teaching how to do this\nYou can do this seriously there are a million tutorials and it's you can have a fun right away even if you're just playing the guitar and singing to tracks even if you just want to play the piano into it now\nAs far as jobs go let's face it I'm not going to get drunk and learn to play drums there are three way whether and probably more than three ways are a number of ways that you have drums you can just open a an audio track and in most of these programs will have samples\nAnd you\nGo to the drums samples there are other instruments by the way the samples are\nUsually Rick ... recall the\nInstruments recorded and then converted to file and they included for free you can get drum beats for example like a drum a bar of a drum get\nYour drag it in the attract poof it's there you can extend that you can mess around with it and logic they have a thing called drummer\nOpen drummer track one yes it's opened up and\nIt's\nA you can choose a drummer there are a number of dramas like they got goofy names that might be ten of them any you choose it's just that she has a different style it's just the difference a name for a different style it's like an icon for ...\nAnd you choose the type of cat California get there are a million types of ... kids and you can also Jews and affects sweet which\nThey have names for like it's got a lot of compression on it so there are three choices you make the drummer in this in this little software drum thing called drama style of the drama of the kids and the effects on it and it is kind of it's a meaty\nExample of them use of medieval enmity is when an electronic it's like you play a keyboard into a track it doesn't play piano but it plays the the software and but when you\nDo that it makes a mock so Everytime you play at a place of software again this drummer track you open up the drummer that puts automatically some of this mini that controls\nAnd plays the drums and you can mess around with that a lot and there are a million a combination of kits and drums styles and then on top of that you can do another track that draws in a loop so in one case you have the ...\nDrums another case the audio loops [noise] then you mess around with it you can put okay you can put the guitar panic to the left\nAnd put some effects on it you can take the base put it in the middle\nAnd put some effects on it's good to have compression on drums because ... is a lot of energy\nAnd you want to keep 'em tight so that doesn't interfere with other parts of the sun you can um guitar piano you play the piano and another tracking pen that to the left maybe make that a little louder and put a little put some reverb on that one and then you want to sing\nYou you're a microphone\nMicrophones on record court goes into your interface just like the guitar did open audio track\nJews just hoping one sign out put two from the interface which is your Mike and record got your headphones on you have to remember to turn the speakers off and your headphones on when you turn on the microphone record because you don't you'll get feedback\nYour microphone would have speakers and the speakers will hear the microphone and it'll get this loop so you need to use your headphones\nAnd there you go that's basically it\nAnd uh you you massages you mess with it and then you leave it alone for a while and then you go back and maybe sinks more or re saying are two parts over at a little bit take away a little bit at a little guitar here a little sound effect their little little ramp up here a volume a little ramp down there\nYou can also steal other people's said drum beats ... even if\nYou as a song that has like a an expose kick drum starts up maybe the kick drum you can just take that one drum\nAnd\nSay that as an MP three and it becomes a sample that you made shut the drum it and you can put a little effect on it and just entirely different drum hit so really you're not ripping anybody off anymore it's a totally different thing now [noise]\n[noise] and then you drag it in as maybe I'm a big ... germs found that you use every once in a while so you can you can uh customize it that way you can work with other people you can\n\nDo do a everything but the guitar and then make that an MP three send it to somebody and say hey play this and then record your guitar\nBy itself and send it to me that guitar track and I'll mix it in that's what I did with my colleague Jean connect Joe you may remember remember king next Joe and there's a song that king that Joe is on that we did together it's an original song about you\nYou know every once in a while I think I should play it is no problem with licensing rights 'cause it's an original songs mine is a talk radio station true but it's almost kind of like a promo because it talks about you know talks about\nA\n... it's a blue songs so it has is a song about you guys in all your problems\nTalks about Dolly in Quincy she's got the bed bugs talks about Glenn he's got the blindness I Know he's he's a visually impaired but that doesn't sound good in a blue saw in a blue song he's got his blindness\nAnd see who else is in it somebody I remember from Fall River can't get any sleep\nAs far as the unsafe toxins people left concerns over formaldehyde mercury or aluminum and vaccines is true they're in there\nIs truly a toxic to the human body but in certain levels only really really tiny trace amounts of these\nHer in and FDA approved vaccines in fact according to FDA and CDC formaldehyde is produced at a higher rate by our own metabolized\nBy the ... systems that in the vaccination and there's no scientific evidence that low levels of this chemical\nMercury or aluminum in vaccines can be harmful if you think of times it's because you want to think so [noise] you know this I Believe there's cyanide and apple seeds\nYou still eat apples right okay\nLet's find
