G\nReject talking and now ... is Jay talking\n[noise] hello there and you know I was so good to have I always\nI I Want\nTo call all the time but um I just can't help but I Love you and your show and [noise]\nYou just when you talk about human rights an animal they can't help but call but I I Want to say um that you first about why he thought you should defend me last week it's because I'm calling to defend you against yourself and that's why I always thought I always think you could offend me 'cause I always defend you in other words you said you wouldn't be a good father that's ridiculous\nMaybe when you were younger I don't 'cause I don't know what you were like but the way I now I think he will be a good dad\nAnd I get the audience offshore honestly\nDon't you're going to have to really want you to be good at it\nYes I think you do have to want to but I Do feel that if you were put in that predicament you wouldn't be able to help but Ravi a kick because when you love you you go find the dogs yeah\nI mean I could be wrong but I just the way you talk and we always thinking and your your mindful about so many things I Can't imagine it wouldn't be a good dad\nI Would say a too worried all the time I'd be a helicopter dead\nOh me too but you want to know I don't think there's anything wrong with that I don't care what people say I think it's better to be more productive than neglectful and indifferent\nThat's I you know\nYou're giving them the ... of the car for her and my worry so much me too and it would be no fun what\nIt doesn't matter how much that that trait translates love\nThat that that if that's in that's something that I Can't put it to what how important it is and and kids pick up on that and even though it would be a pain and it can be like that and just stuff\nThat they would never forget how much he loved them and that make what I Believe that's what makes a human being the best kind of human being is lots and lots of other things too but I anyway obviously you can say whatever you want about yourself but I I feel like you would be a good dad\nThank you very much so next topic I Want to thank Adam how are we from Brooklyn and the caller before Hitler set out with a great call last week on so upset I Can't remember the caller before him but they both compliment in may and I always like to thank people who compliment me\nHow are you in Brooklyn and someone\nElse before him I was just so taken with them after being criticized the week before I was so taken with being complimented which of course I have to get used to both of them going to be a voice for biodiversity it's hard you know that you know how it is no matter how many complement you get one bad one can send you want to tell you the way\n... well I Can't let that bother me because I get people complaining about me all the time\nI Know my ... that's a good thing in a sense that makes it tough\nI guess and certainly hear them in generally the you know generally they're ignorant you can just tell so\nI don't feel so bad I mean it was a smart person will not like me then I feel bad\nI yeah I Know him and all like they haven't really even listen to your show but they're criticizing it's one\nThing yeah yeah this is the perfect time to bring this up towards the end of friday called up mark who started yelling at them ... hours on bashing liberals they thought I was a a\nUs so not that they thought I was in you know it's a Tea Party type of person and I was bashing liberals\nWow I mean you criticize both sides but that's not bashing\nAnd also this liberal said a nasty word to mark he was out and it was obscene that's just angry and obscene\nOkay that's a great segue for me asking you what's wrong with the way they think public public discourse which what I I Believe political correctness is a form of\nRaising public discourse I also called tonight because they weren't getting any calls 'cause I I really if you were getting a lot of calls as much as I wanted to call I probably wouldn't have thought you know like I just like I call too much\nAnd it was very nice no no you you you're often\nI Love you okay so I don't I just wanted to say about political correctness I get it sometimes it is annoying but I think it's a good thing 'cause it forced\nThey have to think before we speak and it forces us to confront some believe we haven't we don't even realize that we have because we've been so conditioned to think certain ways I think a lot of times we don't even realize we have prejudices\nOr maybe belief that are not helpful to the public good so I kind of like political correctness\nAnd I could say that I Know that they want to say\nWell I mean even banning ... there's a college has banned the term freshmen claiming it promotes rape oh wow there's a Seattle police can't use the word suspects in reports [noise] who'd been banned the use of man Princeton University\nBans the use of the word man\nI Am sure yeah it's unfortunate we take things to an extreme\nRight now is is that university bans the phrase the use of the phrase politically incorrect\nAnd I don't know what to say about some of these but\nI Do want to tell you that I loved route to the founders of this country when as a kid I was in a lot more than I was in love with this idea of America does not ... tang I was like I felt that it ... from trees and they fought the record\nBut then I learned about slavery and fifth grade and I was devastated I'm not exaggerating I came home practically in tears\nSaying to my parents had a man who speak so eloquently about fan of course they probably didn't articulate but that way in fifth grade but can't because I was so fascinated with the um [noise]\nThe independent what set the declaration of independence is just so beautiful\nI owe him and I I could never get past it so I think that we can recognize the greatness and humans and at the same time acknowledging but you know what\nIt's not just that they weren't perfect does things about them that we should absolutely despite I mean I Can't look at Washington and jackets and the same way yes they were brilliant yes I'm grateful for the country they created their own hands\nAnd I can never we shouldn't forget that that money on humans okay you could think well they were men of their time blah blah blah well you and I exist today and we wouldn't have animals and there's plenty of people\nWho are are we not hold like ... ... washing it up as a a good\nGuy as hot as high because as a hero yeah I mean\nHe deserves a lot of credit obviously and like I say we should recognize that but we also acknowledge and along with recognizing his weight and I say buddy on him and and that does disparaging greatness\nOr even have a question for you but I don't have time to ask it so I'm putting you on hold okay okay\nI'll ask at all to you and then gee I can answer it after this is the question is hanging out there do you think the me
