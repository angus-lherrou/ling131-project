some in some states um you have to provide some type of credit monitoring service for a year\nTo everyone who got hacked that costs money um there's also you know you need to write inform everybody\nIn writing that there was a data breach they can't rely on the news\nSo perfect example is my accountant or his his information was compromised is data was compromised was by accident actually it was by accident someone internally did something they weren't supposed to and basically um\nTook all the information off a server put it on a thumb drive and walked out of the office was that that employee was actually leaving wow the company and so there's five of us in our ... in my in my house and we got five letters\nWhy is simply saying dear Chris or die you know this is what happened here is a free off of her life walk for example if you want to use it did you know I didn't but because if I mean it's you know so yeah so it is costly to the business it's costly to the business\nIs it a crime with a guy did leave in with that ... it's dealing\nWell he ... the information that the agency that the accounting firm owned a business owns the employees don't on that information the business owner ... owns that information and information's privileged as has Social Security\nNumbers\nName is ... is it's the it's the only time it's the stealing of information so they they knew it was that they do anything to that guy while they\nI'm ...\nI'm not really sure what happened with the licensing bureau is a state of whatever happened with that or whatever happened but um there were lawsuits there was the last\nSubject they basically so it's very costly when a company gets hacked they have to write to everybody they have to offer life lock they suffer reputation damage and fewer people by their so they can buy insurance to cover the\nCorrect so businesses can can buy insurance to\nPay all those costs that's assuming that they don't get sued by someone who's data was taken\nSo if if somebody's data was taking a Social Security number or credit card information was taken that person who stuff was taken could certainly sue the the retailer the business that it was stolen from\nThey can they only if money's\nStolen from them others seriously on the basis of their information is not secure and I don't know necessarily know that they could sue based based upon the information that was stolen but if the information is used right now you have\nYour own little data breach at home where you have your your credit card gets compromised and now you have to pick up the phone and make a phone call and tried to straighten that disaster out and it all takes time\nTime is money times valuable\nAnd he had to cross to them they think before I watch him to the

happens to people they want to access to your computer so you're going to call that number in the basement and what you do when that happens is you reach around to the back of the computer and you're pulled a cold right out that stops that from ...\nYeah and they say do not cook out of this do not shut down an editor it's that's what you do exactly you just shut down your computer you have to pull

I mean I had to pay that and I have I can have a thousand dollars in the bank and you can have an fifty million dollars in the bank yeah so where is the ... you know where's the well an average person has maybe someone will call it that maybe someone will come out of insurance why don't you start that oh sure no problem in my mind you can you talk\nWith an insurance company and say hey there's a certain risk it's a very small risk and so you don't have to charge that much money but I think I Know when these one guy who want some kind of a literal way they have it on his under another heading it wouldn't be cyber it would just be I I lost my money for whatever reason\nThe evidence of that but if you lose your mind if the if the money gets taken out of your bank account whether it's a credit card or whether it's a your account through a debit card or even a credit card the government has systems in place that the banks will reimburse you\nKnow banks but I think if you have an e trade or whatever I Am convinced that I Can't speak to well\nA lot of people have the considerable do in those sure and some companies are better about their promise to you Dr is good about it or there's a less good\nThe the the best the best scam out there right now is the IRS scam and why do you mean by that is there's a set thing follow your income tax early in what I mean by that is yeah if I'm if I have your Social Security number I can go online and file and file your taxes\nWith my information so your refund I make up how much you made I make up everything I have a Social Security number you name and address\nYour filing that none of filing a ...\nReturn yeah and when you file your return a month later you go and do your taxes and you go on line you know it gets submitted electronically yeah you've got a letter from the IRS\nSorry your term was already filed already sent out a refund shows on the hook for that that you have to fight it out with them I Wonder what are the so they're all your taxes early because this way of somebody else's or Social Security number your first you went [laughter]\nWow that's good advice in a tough tough world oh case so six one Seventy five or ten thirty if anybody has a question we have about eight minutes left to go\nAnd um I have some general questions the other day and you've covered this before this is why I had my answer my answer was no\n... no excuse me my answer was yes Roger does have insurance now I I periodically talked about how much I like Roger and people periodically call up and yell at me saying hey they don't have insurance ... et cetera but they do now correct\nWell they they did they they they they do so basically what the ride sharing righteous service\nA several month there right now so basically what happens is they do have insurance and they have from the beginning\nBut what wasn't covered was when the driver from the ride share flip turns his app on to say I'm working now and I'm ready to pick up I'm looking for I'm waiting for a little pain to come in for the fair you know for your was first fair\nUnder the ride sharing assurance there was no coverage for them for when they turned that apple on 'til they actually get to the ... to pick up the passenger now that his\nRide share is excluded under any Massachusetts auto policy if you're out there driving around you don't expect your best auto policy to pay anything you can purchase for about seven percent of your premium\nWhich was ... you can purchase coverage which would cover that small period of time when you turn your apple on when you're working you turn the app on and you're waiting to pick up the first fair\nSo they're not required to have that the companies I Know that gal nope [noise] so do you get whacked by somebody on the way to pick up a fair you and they don't they're not required to have insurance for that period of time and so you might be outta luck\nCorrect correct but I'm more of your of your or if you're a ride share driver and you hit a telephone pole yeah and yeah so uh\nI Would like it if the state required them to carry that just for that one period of time yep yeah I was like that that would be still\nFolks I Love over and lift I Would take it any time over a cab we can have that fight later on I I submit that you take over a few times and you'll never go back\nSo we have Betsy and the boat I Wonder if she wants to know about boats insurance Betsy in the boat who knows at all I'm surprised or even calling up Betty into seem to know everything\nI have a conundrum oh oh [noise] um [noise]\nIn fact there is something on edge taken out on like ...\nAnd ... it it's a lot line well travel had application is long lines\n... [noise] ... states that I had a heart surgery and find out they can track titled specific date I wasn't even in the United states a lot\nYou know I'm going to stop it here I don't think this is really within the scope of our discussion\nYeah I don't I don't I mean unless you want to ensure it's more I Would say it's a\nVoice quite quite a quite a predicament I gonna say\nYeah my question is um I've tried to get what the banks lacked getting anywhere is there a particular agency I should go to\nWell I I'm sure you've already been to the secretary of state's office six cetera et cetera I Would talk to a local attorney and you know because it's a you know it's not an insurance issue but I Would certainly talk to the secretary of state's office if you have not already did\nYou do that yet Yes sir okay that was no avail on that and that's where the value\nThey told me it was beyond the scope of their office\nI don't see why it was going to be an office somewhere I just don't know what it is I Would talk to a local attorney I I don't I it's kind of the only advice I can give you 'cause it's if it was insurance so I could certainly put you in the right direction thanks very much like a terrible situation\nPush it is their insurance against that kind of thing that a person can\nIs there I'm not an umbrella policy but kind of an umbrella identity policy\nWill there in ... so we ... we put her on all the policies that we sell\nThis call's identity the identity fraud\nExpense coverage okay hey it's cheap it's like twenty dollars some of the company's throat and basically what it does is it pays it's not going to pay if you lose any money but it's going to pay your expenses meaning dealing with the credit card bureaus the insurance companies will do all that for you it will also pay\n'em you know cost of getting things notarized et cetera et cetera et cetera\nIt provides a little bit of coverage but not that much\nSo there are a lot of floods and all we've covered this before but briefly flood insurance is generally not included correct\nNo the U.S regular homeowner's policy does not cover\nGroundwater commonly referred to as flood or one of those are kind of rain well it depends it's going to cover of the ... if the rent rainwater would be covered but he just can't come from the ground visit ground first it's still grounded Otto yeah because if it comes to a whole new roof\nShingles blow off rain gets in absolute covered under almost policy absolutely\nAlright and sixty seconds on coverage as you may not need never won the causing damage waver on rental car which ... so if you're\nIf you're in Massachusetts and you have full coverage in your car you do not need to buy any extra insurance when you go to rent a car\nAnd the closing damage wherever only covers you ended up to correct correct so you're only\nSo when you go on vacation make sure first of all talk to your independence urine stage at first and they'll tell you the same thing\nWhich is why you need to buy any of the extra insurance why having an independent insurance agents is as good as one of them as many as one of the ... one of the ... what are some of the other benefits\nJust be just that if somebody you can call somebody can trust yeah you go on the Internet and buy insurance it's like on a year on a blind date\nAlright it's always good to have your like writing your own will I guess right it's good to have you on are always a hope you're like I knew exactly as you enjoy the\nDecaf cappuccino any time as long as that machine operates You're welcome to come to swing by and get a cappuccino six or seven to five or ten thirty WB the I got to ask you about\nBill and Hillary\nHillary says bill shouldn't have resigned over that Monica Lewinsky thing she says he's she says that doesn't really\nApply to the hash tag me too movement what do you think of that\nSix one Seventy five or ten thirties WB\nWhen our family struggled with our son substance use we were scared and didn't know where to turn but there is hope in families can he'll just like we didn't connect with a trained parents specialist who can offer guidance some support for families in Massachusetts call our toll free\nParent helpline at one eight four four three one nine five nine nine nine or visit Greg an addiction support dot org message from the partnership for a drug Free Kids and the great can Center for addiction at Boston medical center\n\nW.

to be non white I get that\nShe goes on but it's also complicated very very complicated the dictionary definition of consent to give permission for something to happen and yet what did that something

don't know\nHow she feels like a victim but Monica you would be nobody if this hadn't happened to you probably nice and kind of hard on her but\n\nIt seems like she was into it I would've been into it you were twenty two years old he was really wrong for him to do that\nBut he did I'd say\nComfortable but I don't know how much a victim you are the only reason you might be a victim as you would be afraid\nThe power the president to say no then I Would see how your victim but I don't hear her saying that\nThis was on he was twenty seven use my senior year of life experience no better he was a

Boston\n[noise] Cindy\nI'm leaving what up\nMm [noise] well I think she was a very immature twenty two and I think I think she did it more for celebrity factor telling her friends that she was involved with the president and I think she went into it with her eyes wide open but then he played with her 'cause he kept telling her he might leave Hillary\nAnd you know that was the thing that really I think he did wrong if he had that look you know we're just going to do this and it's fun and they weren't going to take by that would have been one thing and judged on another scale like it you know he played with her\nYou know I'm thinking of leaving my wife\nAnd he you know your your precious and your timing and you know and he might have thought to myself well he was being gallant saying those things but he was just leaving or on and I think she felt so down when the whole thing was over it and that's what caused the frustration and anger and hurt by it [noise]\nYou know that's a great point and a great question only the so you make it seemed like no one could say that the crime is in the dumping not in the in the contact\nYeah yeah I think that she did care about him but only for the celebrated factor I think she was too young to understand what she was doing but you\nKnow when her what she she knew she was involved with the president's you knew about the celebrity factor she knew all that what would what did you not understand\nI don't think she knew him as a person you know I mean in let's say the thing when full circle and he left Hillary married Harry what a cheated on her and you know she didn't see that find down the road\nThrough and it was insane to think if someone's gonna leave their wife for you to twenty two year old entering yeah\nHe didn't she never scientists who he was she just saw him you know it's a celebrity that want to be with her and she could tell her friends about it and it was an exciting thing\nWhen you say who he was ... was he was he ...\nHe had no intention as serious as her or anybody else\nI didn't get married Hillary because she was a part in it for him [laughter] you know not because of the\nI mean I don't know I met him in a pattern that marriage but from what she put up with you know and it's a shame that they had more of an alliance\nAnd the ... that's that's only might might take on it but um but you know she she was not the type that wanted an alliance Monica [noise] you know she wanted romance and love and infidelity and [noise]\nYou know and and he was knocked ever give her those things and she didn't see that\nRight you know I I I agree with ya\nJust he took advantage of her now you're going to tell you when it came to relationships you took advantage of her not physically 'cause they that was very clear understood by both\nYeah took advantage of are you saying civil emotionally by knowing he could lead her aunt and her she was naive about\nThe likelihood of their romance being forever and ever\nYeah and it's you know she never saw him as a person she saw him as her Knight in shining armor and he was going on and self to her and went to stopping ... you know and that would be that she\nDid become celebrities she never did parlay that celebrity into anything\nBut I think she was hurt and frustrating for felt foolish and you know I think you know he really put a number on her emotionally you know I don't think she was evil I think it was just immature unselfish\nShe was selfish how she selfish while she was going to take them away from LA okay yeah\nI mean you know the fact that he's dealing with Hillary for was at that point over thirty forty years meant nothing to her\nAnd I must have been weird having that a fair I'm seeing Hillary around man I Would have been afraid of Hillary more than him\n[noise] well I don't think they only knew about it and she I think she probably thought that push came to shove you know he stand up for her and leave Hillary so I think she was probably excited by the Hillary thing in one of these days she's going to get her singing though\nAnd also so grungy so grumpy out I mean the whole\nThing was Gordon Gee you know and if if she'd had any kind of maturity issue would have seen that but she didn't and that wasn't her fault that was the fact\nThat you know he's one of my ... one of my buddies with Bill is really the president of United States of America if you're going to have an affair is your please do it was like not an intern you're gonna have anyone\n[noise] well I think I Would I\nDo yeah the tall skinny white actors would duty rabbits yeah yeah\nSomebody like that so well you know the thing to that guy the bag to tackle the\nSecret life and the private life and all that\nBut it seems to me that when you you know the thing I don't hold against John yet is that what he did he did before he was president\nAnd that's to me a line you know what JFK did and what so many of the others did after they became president I think is to give up\nYou know when you're not the president and you're a private citizen that's a new a new life but when you're president whatever you do I think it's putting you in the country\nSo I kinda like that I hadn't really fun and before\nAnd so you know I don't ... I mean he's not my cup of tea but is millennia labs and go for it but what he does when he is president becomes my my issue you know\nWould you stay with him if you're millennia or would you stay was uh if if you were Hillary was when she\nBought into I mean I Can't believe that they didn't know what kind of person that will marrying especially on the line is she was ... wife number three of four yeah so I mean they they must have known and enlisted side of the trade off was okay you know and ...\nThe tradeoff exactly the tradeoff is okay she said in a small her little hot in Slovenia or you know and not have it and have a husband that may or may not you know or she could have this has been be the first lady she could be living in New York\nI I used the food for years and I was three thirty pounds overweight\nI over eat I eat the wrong stuff like that but the sugar and\nSalt and everything else and had medical problems but um [noise] my wife has been doing a lot of homework on she deals in ... and everything else we didn't watch YouTube stuff I'm like that other caller was talking about\nThis is going to do is put you on hold and you can explain more about it after the break so it's Doug from air he's extremely concerned about doing the right thing he's extremely concerned about doing the right thing by Jesus and wants to go to heaven like we all do\nAnd of course he doesn't want to do anything that might prevent him from getting in heaven like\nCannabis if it's wrong but he's found the candidates can be very helpful and he's found evidence that may be Moses use it too so it's okay we'll continue in a moment\nSaudi Arabia is reportedly ready to admit some level of involvement in the disappearance of ... the Washington Post contributor was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago and President Trump has said secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia this morning\nWhile I'm sitting here just to find out [noise]\nReally firsthand what has what they know\nWhat's going on he may or may not CBS\nNews State Department report or ...\nFatty leadership is preparing now ... ... ... say that and can mall 'cause he was murdered by accident [laughter] because they were trying to go there and in ... but instead of different ... and he ended up dead at the fat\nTurkish officials sacred show he was killed in a conflict and dismembered after they search the building he was last seen in for nine hours on Monday CBS News updates on math piper\nAmericans works to prevent suicide\nIf you need to talk about how you're feeling if you're grieving the loss of a loved one to the time you're learning how to help out everything you can find support from ... but now he's feeling desperate born starting about anything in your life call or text American skate by how blind twenty four seven seven seven\nEight cutting around forty six Seventy three for ... or or W.

wisdom on building renovations and might be part of the conversation and your questions and comments\nI hardly the dot com\nOne seven Seventy seven Seventy one when he met the Celtic Tiger cat anytime I mean I heart radio there in the dumps o\nW receiver WXXI ... two men for an eye on radio station\nWith with Trump and the the I don't know if you're aware of the um the billboards that I saw um Cambridge with a guy named ... who says that I'm only a fake Indian ... only only a real Indian can beat a fake Indian\nYeah and I just sort of like really have we stoop to their just rehab I as I said\nI think both of those things equally offensive to Native Americans and then I'd like to shipped over and I also wanted to say I love all your programs when you do all your history stuff\nUm and this is a history matter I on a Columbus Day I attended I'm a screening of a film called um\n[noise] uh [noise] dawn ... which was a put together by a group called an funded by the standard project and\nI work for them to a commentary by a woman who is in ... degree is missing lesser and she brought there were some other um professor there as well\nBut the the ... the film is about Native Americans in England who has been essentially um taken away\nFrom their families and put into foster care as part of cultural genocide of Native Americans and this is like ongoing and one of the individuals who attended\nA ... is in his thirties\nA hundred percent Native Americans from what I could understand he certainly looks it\nAnd he he is a member of the ... tribe here in Massachusetts and he had\nBeen taken out of the tribe and was in twenty six different foster homes and just horribly horribly treated and this is something that's like this this crap with you know about\nElizabeth Warren or an Indian people say no she's not an anywhere let's let's let's let's talk about\nReal Native Americans let's let's forget this yes about who is or who isn't let's talk about people who are being mistreated by our government\nBy the the welfare system and the and the foster care system and this may\nHe also a calculated thing that was perpetrated against these beautiful people\nIn in in ... for cultural genocide\nHow how do we make reparations for that so if Trump is going to make a donation should it be their her favorite charity I Hope her favorite charity is going to be a a something that really has to do is we don't need it American is considering how I feel that she's insulted them terribly\nActually is a charity is just that\nBut what what what charity is it and then you know if she goes around kissing Native American babies student I'm joking like you know how ... going to kiss babies to make photo ops\nToday and embrace these people's without actually just for a follow up and not actually doing something about the problem until she shows up at a filming a screening of this film she's not putting our money where our mouth is right\nIn my opinion right right because this this isn't\nGut wrenching what these and this is happening even into that seem like the Nineteen eighties at least the seventies and it's it's really astonishing and then she left there is somebody you might want to you know get in touch with an app on your program in the future and also that the young men who is\nPart of the ... tribe um they'd be the easy to find and I'm given that\nI I think you get a lot of really good\nColor is when you have some of those um cultural programs and when you talk about history um you know waxing off no pun intended about Bill Clinton it's just like we don't need any more\nWe we need to talk about real problems and and I think that there's a ... you have this amazing nice goal to do so and I really appreciate it when you use it for for deep issues\nA rare thing right I think it's pretty rare when I talk about Hillary or bill\nAnd it did its it's floating around out there so I did want to talk about it or not I panicked and you say and I I there's another oil that uh you probably have used but I wanted to just mention it sure super strong it's unbelievable I put it in my mouth and it was killed\nWas oregano oil or the or\nThe yes don't use that straight oregano oil will kill you exactly oregano oil has to be diluted I'm In a carrier oil and the only time use oregano oil\nIs I'm In an encapsulated form when it when it's a mix of the area of oil and it's really good for treating I'm Sorry go infection and\nUm you can also in a carrier oil apply it very lightly to a fungal infection Toronto both better almost better taken internally but have you have to get it when it's already encapsulated in something else because otherwise it will it will actually give you a burn on your on your skin\nYou seem to be very connected with the earth and the natural things like Native Americans were are you perhaps in part of the Native American\nWell I I think if we want to do our DNA stuff we might there there is a ledge and that there is Native American and our family but I also\nJust feel I'm very close I've oh well it's interesting because every time I've ever been it at an event or even in an elevator or whatever it is like always men and Native American president Jane where I was maybe there's something to that but also I'm\nLike you know my next door neighbor college was Native American idol and chip ...
