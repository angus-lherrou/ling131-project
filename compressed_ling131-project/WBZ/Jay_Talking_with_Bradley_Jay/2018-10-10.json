I Want to get to know you were a little bit to what can you tell us about your self\nA retired teacher okay um did you teach I Am now I taught in Cambridge okay um\nWhich I I I miss being close to the city that out here a ... but ... says relationships so that the way down here\nAnd you know\nA fair than that but I really don't like to talk about myself because it had so many scam call calls um and you know it just at the point that you know ...\nAnd it makes me really uncomfortable all up to something like four hundred and twenty it's an it's amusing me now and I'm getting calls from supposedly from Russia\nAnd the United states just that's what it says ... states and ... and ... every city in town across the United states where I Know nobody [noise] so I don't answer them but I catch thing could have programs like that that sometimes you're better off that flavor that Janet ...\nAnd then have a nice chat with you I'm a dentist say collected by though that that could be paranoid that so I guess I'm paranoid found that out above me as\nWell too bad my mother was a teacher\nAware ... and ... in ... Barrington New Hampshire\nI never even heard of that town councilor represented\nOh it's about it's about even the level of Portsmouth New Hampshire it's west ... it's a little else west of Rochester\nOh that how they have that problem like our last chance to right now I think I've heard that on the news so it's really a country\nYou know a woman was found in storage unit recently in Rochester New Hampshire a dead out what it was yeah it's\nBeautiful country up there it's especially at that time the air [noise] um I wouldn't I Would love to go up and and see the college\nOh yeah I Hope to do that and\nOne weird things my mother was my teacher how's that you're kidding weird right\nAll the unusual smell is the one we're the only she she wants to master taught a eighth seventh and eighth grade when I was in eighth grade and so it was it was weird it was uncomfortable\nSo that must have been on like one of the trade one of each class all they want to eighth grade\nOh yeah it was their only for teachers to grades per room one teacher would teach first and second grade and the other one third and fourth fifth and sixth seventh and I\nGot it sounds like a long time ago and I know it's not that much\nI'm really kind of is a long time ago but it was also a tiny place only seven hundred and twelve people in the pow\nWow really country millage\nYeah the whole school or I Would say maybe a hundred and fifty kids\nAll ... and that includes all acreage while I Know\nThat that's different than what you look great when I cut and then when I went to school there was one of the ... after twelve years away at twenty six people show why waste spent twelve years together\nMy the year before I START I started the first year of the new school year before that and this rule that I went to my orientation and was one room and all eight grades were in it\nThere was this three parts of the town and I think he's part had their separate little schoolhouse so I think there probably were about I don't know forty kids\nIn all grades in this little weird schoolhouse taught by ... and the teacher that taught my father and she was also my principal how weird is that\nYou had a unique educational experience set set shore towns ... that sounds like something and Eighteen eighty now\nI knew I was um\nAnd it felt the same way we have a guy ... his name he's a talk host and he has written a book called the frost in hell has to do with life in the has to do with the murder in central Massachusetts in the in the Eighteen hundreds and in his descriptions of it\nI felt like it seemed like my town even things didn't change much really in rural America from Eighteen eighty to Nineteen\nYou know sixty\nReally upset right and I will say oh yeah my my grandfather he's he would be logging with using cattle oh into the woods\nWith cattle wow a team\nOf cattle and a big sledding they chop down trees and put 'em on a a a sled to haul out of the woods yeah\nNow\nKnow my mother died and we saw the house and I don't ever go up I never go to my town no\nAnswer at St ... her so that my brother goes well my brother drove by where we grow up we we live in one place we grew up in\nOne place so it's really well here to drive by and see it and it it's surreal it's kinda creepy to see us\n\nTake care Janet thank you very much which\nThey should go six one Seventy five or ten thirty WB the w._b. we have John Joe in Cambridge I Joe\nHey Jay how are you pretty well thank you [laughter]\nSo I was just calling I'm a tea or you're a truck and to work today here at you're following um and I was just curious um ... show you sort of terminated at the uh assembly to stop it sounds like huh\nYeah well I went past September simply to stop to the river and then had to backtrack back to the to stop yeah oh well it's going to get across the river [laughter]\nYeah we had a couple of options um before you hit that at the trash building you could've went on Ninety nine I'm into ever it right away that building the new casino and or you could have come in from on that side into your new office building\nSo our way is that how that is a kind of a big loop out of the ways that's the only option\nNot not really no or you could continue to do what you were and if you cut true that new um [noise] that new class and they both do it all the stories that assembly\nPlace hey if you can't you cannot the other side um I did manage to the river and\nHe did okay and if you kept calling you hit route twenty eight that's McGrath islet cells way\nYou should have been able to walk across that there's a sidewalk so peculiar or the other side\nBy I'm willing to circle\nMotion once you get yeah once you get to the circles and you can you can um walk across a circle and\nIt'd be on the other side where cabbage and now you can just walk along that that side towards your new office park you kinda have to go up and over the overpass there but a ... a little down into the parking lot but you can get over once they are already on the same side as your complex\nYeah hey so you hear from Cambridge so you know all this stuff yeah [noise]\nWell I'm not far from the Amish Cambridge sidetracked by there every day so I'm I'm familiar with the area and they have to add to tell you that some some sort of courage they're walking by that whole area between ... fan and trash that's like no man's land [laughter]\nOh yeah it is now that's what I figured out the road was arrested for that right\nFor the for ...\n... ... is a city square shell station so the city so yeah ... ... square in Charlestown Sunni square shell station keep walking I kind of go past the Ninety nine restaurant in Charlestown keep walking yeah then I I decided\nTo go up to mainstream Charleston I start to go right on one of those side streets to get to the main streets and take a left right in front of the ...\nThan a\nIt's not done yet though\nI Know I Know I was last time I was down there I I saw the tower and drove by it looks kind of Disney like\nYes and I was struck best I can figure out is that the closest to stop will be assembly I think and it seems pretty walkable from there but I'm I'm I'm told that there's going to be a boat or you can take\nYeah that would be nice the whole city needs more boats you know when you're in Europe and you go a lot to Europe you see\nHow you know like the Charles you could\nGo up to water town you know ... down to the hospital you know or it could be a lot of travel on on the water and the Mystic River as some river that I always thought that van Morrison wrote about in to the mystic but that's probably just\nNot a [laughter] the real mystic but it's an interesting where\nIt is so you you know it's interesting as you had a hard operation that's interesting\nYeah well I heard\nA no it hurt afterwards you know because of all the drugs that I had to take and it was at Mass General and then three days later I lost the site in my left eye and I because my I inherited high cholesterol but worse than that I I smoke cigarettes a lot I\nWhen I graduated from Lincoln ... high school in Massachusetts a well no I graduated sixty eight February vacation I went to Jamaica and I bought a pound a pot and they smuggled it back and I sold it at school and I started smoking pot and cigarettes a lot\nTo the doctor told me he said\nIt was a woman doctor and when they did that artery checks the artery so she said something that's what did you do so I had to relive all my smoking days and\nWe've actually at Lincoln said varian sixty eight we legalize smoking for kids because the teachers couldn't stop all the kids smoking and the boys from and stuff so they\nHad smoking areas and I just had my fiftieth reunion and we were talking how crazy that would be today for the high school teachers can you imagine that\nMarijuana cigarettes cigarettes yeah well I don't know how many cigarettes you smoke along\n[noise] well I smoked started in the sixties high school and stop two thousand two I Lived in went for for a while and\nI'm like thirty five years\nYeah yeah and I spy smoked menthol I like Salem lights and\nThose how many pack a day two packs a day\nLike a pack a day you know and and I worked in a photo lab over on land down the street actually in that business was really smoke because you'd [noise]\nWould get ... you go and your dark rum and set up a print and then expose the paper\nBut in the late type box bringing out put on a machine and then you'd have ten minutes waiting for that to be go through the machine so you go out on ... street in smoke with with the other text there then come back in the print would be off the machine you look at it\nMakes them color adjustments put it on the machine again go out into the cigarettes so work smoking and working as really addictive because you get into a routine that I Would imagine a lot of guys and your business probably smoked a lot\nYeah a bunch of his quit in ... in the eighties because uh there was a hypnosis not the mad rush and\nHis name was Barry beater came to the gift you see I don't know he cared a lot of people who smoke it including me nice nice so you so hot\nToo and you got to have you went to Jamaica you bought a pound a pot and you're so good at Lincoln said very high which I think prime was the crime is probably\nThe county the Supreme Court justice\nSo question is how much and how much does the pound of marijuana in in Jamaica\nIt wasn't much I went to ... and I didn't know any better because I wanted to I'd like there was a group of kids in high school we used to go see the young bloods down at\nThis club there was underneath the ground on Boylston Street and I always wanted to get some pot and I was looking around I never could get any so I said well I'll go to Jamaica for February vacation\nI forget what it costs it was\nReally cheap you know I Would be selling out just like for twenty five dollars now it's back in and Lincoln\nUm but it was mostly seeds and stamps and stuff like that but in Jamaica I met this guy outside the hotel and at that time in Kingston they said hey don't leave the hotel ... at night and this kid came up on the wall surrounding the hotel and said\nHey mom what's up man and I said you know I got to get some ... says will need me tomorrow mind so I'd met him and he took me into this incredible shanty town in Kingston and I was just stupid you know luckily I nothing happened to me and I went to this\nLittle shack and this guy had all this pot on the on the ground on a big kind of on a blanket that he was kind of sorting out so\nI got from there and then I went to a place on the island and I met these two guys who are lifeguards they'd all black beach in a white beach I stay at the black beach they let me stay in a little shack next to them\nAnd they would in the morning they would make up their marijuana tea on the beach was great and they they said well you'll be taking it back man what are you going to do and I was going to put it in my suitcase\nAnd they said no man roll it up in plastic and they wrapped around my stomach and at that time I had like a little kind of Brookes Brothers three piece suit thing and I put my tie on and everything got on the plane and I sat with these old ladies from someplace\nAnd we got to Miami and I help them with their luggage off the flight and then I immediately went into the bathroom took that thing off me wrapped it up and got home and\nAbout four months later my parents got a call from one of the slack in Lincoln\nSaying your son is selling narcotics and some of the kids who have sold to rabbit rabbit to their parents are told someone anyways\nBut you have to know that was going to happen right I don't see how anybody can expect and no one's they're going to get away with it\n[noise] I think at that time my mind was kind of dreamy like you know it was it was so I was just on a different space and\nI you know we were supposed to be going to college my dad had gone to ... grew up in Hanover New Hampshire so you and I have something familiar yeah we're both live free or die people by\nYou should you should come down to stoning to Maine that's on their outs five hour trip but it's the largest lobster port in Maine so tiny little town\nIs that where you are yeah um what's the name of it stoning stoning yeah ...\nThere are a lot of crafts people here and and just lobstermen actually um but it's on ... if you look it's about five hours from where you are but the ... the fully just starting to come out I Know you were talking about\nThat yeah that's a super interesting a story you say you tape the marijuana your body you know who else did that was the guy in the movie midnight express things didn't\nGo you know I never saw that movie um but you could have happened to me I was like stupid I Can't believe that I did this you know so that's\nWhy you just say well didn't I think I was going to get caught no it's just like when you're that age that's why you can go to Vietnam 'cause you're not going to die or you know you think that that's why the military works\nYou're pretty pretty darn interesting so how's your heart now about better\n[noise] um well I don't like to take the stat and because I get bad dreams yeah so I'm trying to think well my mom had high cholesterol she's up at Dartmouth now she's Ninety four\nAnd I'm sixty nine and I'm saying well I don't smoke anything now I'm waiting for the you know the the pharmaceuticals to come out because I I\nEnjoy the high from pot

involved and I saw people attempting fail but I'll tell you the truth I knew I Would not fail I knew I was in it for the long haul and it just kept at it I knew I wasn't that good at it and I knew it to practice\nSo whenever there was an opportunity\nEver anywhere to do what show I Would do it\nI did ... feeling wants to our kale and I wasn't very good because that was new at it takes it's something that takes a lot of practice\nAnd a one point a\nAnd I'd send tapes the w._b. they didn't really take them seriously it was a different time but again I I understand they considered me they knew me as the wild guy at the rock station just couldn't imagine that I I could do this\nAnd I kept at it and kept at it and send tapes and tapes and they were not good finally I got this gig one day filling\nIn in ... in Providence Rhode Island I was living on plum island they want to come down here and do a show okay yes with the downside was it was like a two and a half hour drive each way let's call it two hours actually two and a half hours\nFor a two hour show so what I was go down there and get some practice tape it\nAnd you know I have a have a better audition tape if you will because that's all it takes you know that's really all it takes you don't need to go to college oh you need is the tape it's kind of the grand thing about radio so I went down there and I I\nYou know I I didn't worry I wasn't worried because I wasn't going to be I wasn't auditioning for those boss was I wasn't even auditioning for that audience because I wasn't going to work that I didn't expect so we just went for it I was I went for it I was at ease\n'cause I didn't care and ours edgy 'cause I didn't care and you are not caring is a very powerful thing\nWhen you don't care you hot nervous

said well let tapes not so bad mouthing give them a break so gradually got more and more\nFill in work and you get better and better does\nTake a long time ago I worked with Dan ready for a year and a half his producer that was also very instructive I got to see a ... professional operates and uh but I also it'll it loved\nWorking with dinner a allowed them to see me that was the talk radio me and trust me more so as they started to let me fill and more and more\nSo that was a very valuable thing all the things you do they all matter\nAnd then\nOh then there was J talking on Sundays two three hours that was great loved it loved it sometimes of feeling for Dan\nAnd I did this while I was dance producer and then I then I went on to do only the talk radio 'cause when I was the producer I wasn't available to fill in I Want it was really a high priority for me to get better talk radio so I wanted to be available filling and I was\nAnd the time marches on and that Steve live Eli ...

for me I mean it's a different for everyone but for me again back to square one and it's about their relationships and and building them with you and with the guest like some Marco and point that that means the world to me that relationship with Michael calling\nBut the relationship with father Brian and da da and y'all I I don't want to listen to everybody that that matters to me too and\nAny sort of conversation is much more interesting if you if everyone is very vulnerable if you are truly open up that's what I think the secret is it's different for each person for me is not show as much as
