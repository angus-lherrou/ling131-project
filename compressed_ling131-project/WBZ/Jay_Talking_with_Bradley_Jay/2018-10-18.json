V. the buses WXXI ... two men and I heard reviews the\nIt's famous because he organized a series of tribes on\nThe Arabian Peninsula drove into a north up into Syria and and captured Damascus um but then with essentially betrayed\nBy his own government and by the French who passed an agreement to divvy up what his today Syria Lebanon the Israel Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia\nThe people that he worked with a where he's sort of organize these tribes on the Arabian Peninsula they ended up losing even though they won\nA in ... at the time are moving into Damascus but when they lost they lost to the the family that was the house of Saud and so Saudi Arabia is founded in the Nineteen thirties Nineteen thirty two I think\nAnd we have had a relationship with them it was ever shortly after um because essentially what happens is that\nA Saudi Arabia captures the two most holy places in Islam mecca and Dina\nI'm and that the Saudis represents\nA branch of Islam called Sunni Islam which is the largest branch and it is opposed by the other side of Islam called Shia Islam which is in Iran and so we had this curious situation where\nThe U.S has actually supporting Iran I'm In the Nineteen fifties and we actually toppled the Iranian government put in place our own guy\nA and then we stationed troops in Iran and we set up an oil company to help pump oil out of Iran or for decades until the Iranian Revolution in Seventy nine kicks out and we suddenly become a enemies to Iran and Saudi Arabia becomes one of our closest allies\nAre and then of course they have the largest production of oil in the world actually actually that's not true of the United states produces more oil today than Saudi Arabia does that sort of a a fluke\nAnd most important thing is that Saudi Arabia can produce it much cheaper than anybody else\nSo the United states produces oil um it's about twenty five dollars a barrel on average\nAnd the kingdom of Saudi Arabia can produce of about ten dollars a barrel so they can\nAfford to flood the market with a lot of their oil and then drive the price down to arrange that puts other country's oil under pressure and and they start losing money or when they produce but Saudi Arabia continues to gain money so that sort of like the the big\nThread that ties to the right first and foremost it's Saudi Arabia controlling the price of oil in the world markets secondly it's now that Saudi Arabia is the strategic enemy of our strategic enemy which has Iran um right now and that\nSaudi Arabia holds down the two most holy places in Islam and the U.S has a big a big sway in places like Syria and um Iraq where there's other there's complicated um ethnic and religious issues there that are driving those conflicts\nSo what do we get out of the relationship and what do they get out of [laughter]\nSo uh we get oil but more than that and actually we don't really use their ... what other people get away with what we get is stability so we use Saudi oil to stabilize prices in the world um and we use Saudi Arabia to stabilize the region\nUm with their money and with the oil prices that they can sort of set so they can help us or hurt us in places like Iraq or Syria or Iran why and\nGo ahead and a lot of weapons from us so we are providing them with billions of dollars worth of weapons system in the news recently um our weapons are being used to prosecute a war in Yemen right now Yemenis an ally with Iran so that's what's going on\nSo how much of what we get from Saudi Arabia could we get from Iran ... what would happen if we were more friendly to run an Iranian seemed to be at their core much more like we are and just waiting for a chance like inside of\nAn every Iranian is an American trying to get out\nI think that's true um I have a I have an uncle who comes from Iran spin and friends from there also um and I can I can see very much what you're saying\nThe ... in terms of oil we could get you know Iran can't produce like Saudi Arabia can but it can have a major impact but the the basic differences is that she Islam is a much smaller\nA population of of Muslims Sunni Islam and uh and in the end\nAnd machine are controlled by Saudi Arabia so we can't get that with Iran\nAll right we do we lose moral authority continuing to deal with the Saudis or ... and I guess the question I asked ... do we have any at this point\nDo we have any moral authority here is that oh God [laughter]\nOh boy\nI'm I think we've done a lot of harm to it and the situation with the Saudi journalist a\n... is um is a\nHeartbreaking I'm you know we're all but certain uh people even like Lindsey Graham the Republican side has said you know we believe that he was murdered\nIn the Saudi constantly it's by Saudi officials under the orders of MS beam hamlet NBS Mohammed bin Salman the the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nAnd even Lindsey Graham is talking about imposing sanctions so\nI think if we don't do something I think you have you know a few more days if if as a secretary Pompeo says you need to give that the Saudis some time to sort of come up with a new story um that's fair but I think after a few more days and you're going to see a lot of push to do something especially after the midterm election\nAny chance that it was a the conservative ... that did it to embarrass a in our family was not being conservative enough\n[noise] I don't really know enough about that level of detail to to speculate on it um what we do know is that ... was was highly critical of NBS uh basically said that he was not a reformer that he made himself out to be\nA and we know at this point that more than a handful of the Fifteen or so people who are believed to be involved with a with the alleged murder are linked to a M. S. N. B. S. in the security services okay so the question now really is\nCan Mohammed bin Salman survived the scandal as the heir apparent or a does he loses chance at the throne\nInteresting so are all in the ... and cries and follow coming from the U.S just hot air because we'll never do anything that we really will not imposed sanctions on someone that is so where so deeply involved with correct\n[noise] I don't know I mean it's always surprising when Lindsey Graham is is arguing for something like this or any other question is\nYou know you don't have imposed on tomorrow you could wait until after the elections and and see what happens in the house and the Senate um and and\nImpose them after the new Congress seated in January um so so Congress could legislate sanctions um enforce them on the president like they did with the Russian sanctions a couple of years ago\nOkay back to the moral authority doesn't really matter moral authority to just feel good does it doesn't really have anything to do with our power and our influence\nI absolutely believe that it does our our core interest\nIs in having as many democracies in the world as possible um and we're we're different that way because democracy itself as a moral interest rate we don't believe that all governments are equal regardless of what kind of regime type they have we believe that um democratic representation is\nThe only a moral way to govern the country\nAnd so even with a place like like Saudi Arabia we work with these countries but our our long term rhetoric has always been that we do this with the hopes that in time\nThey will begin to liberalize and democratize their systems and so I think that's a it's an absolutely core American value it helps explain how we behave um in terms of foreign policy and uh and when we were not consistent with how we follow it\nUm but in a case like this where it seems like the violation is just a astounding only\nA bald faced a I think it's quite problematic if we don't do something to stand up for those\nWho seems like our moral authority has been eroded it seems to be what you say how do they get eroded water some recent events or what is the reason events that haven't voted it\n\nTo Russia um when the Soviet Union fell he ended up as a deputy mayor in St Petersburg and then ah many people believe began a series of um\nCorrupt deals that started together money for him and and money from a local area communist parties that needed to get their money abroad and hide it as a as a Soviet Union was collapsing and they were afraid that they would lose the Communist Party would be outlawed and they would lose that money\nAnd putting a German language skills and his experience or in the west put him in a position to launder a lot of money or at least I have to buy a lot of people that I trust on this and he started to make this money and then was um\nWas moved up the chain by Boris Yeltsin who was the president at first president of Russia the nineties he became head of the KGB and then you also in a advocated the presidency and handed it to ...\nYou know that's a good spot to have to actually break and I'd like to talk a little more after this bubble laundering parts W.

Saturday same thing only with a couple of showers six Seventy five or ten thirty Seventy busy feel free to call us\nWe would match that Dr Matt Smith talking foreign policy and focusing on now Russia and potent and the relationship with the United states you gave a brief history of Newton's rise in Soviet Union and Russia and included a mention of a communist money and\n... was really good at gathering that up as a a communist comic communism fell Soviet Union fell apart heavier laundered I saw active measures this documentary that\nSpent substantial time showing that Trump Tower was a haven for such money laundering how true is that\nA very true um let me let me talk for a second but some of my other work that was um\nLast in the hill a newspaper right after the election about December [noise] um I published a T sort of catching uh some things out that I I I cannot fully proved budget but the\nThesis goes something like this [noise] um\nThere was the largest money laundering case in us history was about seven and a half billion dollars and it was prosecuted in New York and it was essentially all Russian money a billion dollars is believed to bend laundered through the U.S by the Georgian character that was in Egypt the view from its chew in Trump\nTower meeting just to to draw that connection then right\nUm the most of this went through a bank called the republic bank of New York um there there there's all sorts of scandal around that the death of the um the the the man who ran the bank to preserve that bank back in Nineteen Ninety eight I'm\nSo all of this stuff is swirling ad in the nineties the Russians basically are moving billions and billions of dollars\nUm hundreds of billions of dollars out of the country and trying to trying to clean it and parking and safe places\nAnd there's basically two ways that you do this if you want to move a lot of money that's relatively clean\nAnd and whitewash it said that you can invest it elsewhere you do real estate [noise] and if you have really dirty money for things like drugs and prostitution you use casinos [noise] because you're going to lose eighty percent of it\nIs in Washington but the casinos for all the pay off and everything else and you lose comparatively less in real estate you can you move forward or something that's essentially what has happened with the apartments in the Trump towers or the infamous a deal with the ah with the residents in I'm In Florida\nThat this money is being laundered a in these the the real estate and casino deals\nThat much of this what's happening in the Nineteen nineties\nDutch bank who was Donald Trump's major a lender after all the other banks stop lending to him because it was bankruptcies in the nineties which then paid off the largest the largest settlements just a few years ago here was the bank that helped\nMove all of this money and it was he was a sense of the largest chunk of it was Russian money coming through torture by going to um you know other places in the U.S almost certainly including\nThe Trump Organization although we don't have proof of that is your contention that are\nBoth Trump Tower condominiums and the casinos that Trump was involved in both those levels of laundry\n[noise] my guess is is that the Trump is not the details man [noise]\nUh and and so he doesn't understand or know about\nThe legal niceties that allow this to happen and where things are being shaded where where laws are being sought out broken that that is mostly in the realm of his um his financial group whose name I'm missing right now who was\nIndicted by a law or just a few weeks ago\nOkay so I don't know if I committed a crime just saying I I'm not a details man doesn't really economy and how how is it possible that\nSomebody can launder that much money and not get caught and how is it possible that some\nAnd did that could become president how's this possible of someone who did that said president I don't get it [laughter]\nWell the first the first problem is is that uh\nWe're laundering money implies that you can prove that the money was illegally gained\nIn the first place and when you're looking at Russia especially in the Nineteen nineties you don't even know what laws are in a factory is or the Soviet lost all of the fact that they were new laws who's following what\nAnd so so proving that this is corrupt money even though everyone knows that it is um is is very different thing in a legal sense of what was what was your second question so we can we prove that this happened\nYou know legally that's that's harder than uh than I think people realize the second question is\nHow do how do you come in with that yeah he's in case and how do you stay president and I guess the first answer answer the second to question the second two questions yeah yeah do you prove it you don't you can't prove it but I Would think you really could prove it in the ... the documentary active measures\nThey say that condominiums are being bought and sold without even any identification right is that that's how it works right and gun crime isn't that kind of crime me\nIt is kind of crime you but then you have the problem of of liars loans which but good chunk of Americans signed on you know before two thousand eight also which is essentially the same kind of thing and I had a you know we've had a misdemeanor a felony crime\n[noise] and so there's all sorts of ways that you can you can skirt these things I I think something something Crimea happened uh but whether or not you can you can prove this to a level of of your satisfaction is a different story but that's why you know the bowler investigation isn't\nIt is gathering a lot of this data and I think that there's sort of there's three\nThree big pillar to it right one is is whether or not there was collusion um on on interfering in the campaign right now the second one is whether or not there was obstruction of justice against similar investigation about interfering with the campaign\nBut if he actually tried to do something it would hurt him worse um but there's a political benefit again in in doing it this way right in in building a sub deploying the sub moving in about provocatively around Internet cables and forcing us to reactivate the you know the Atlantic fleet and things like that [noise] um so that's it's it's the old game field Soviet game\nOkay president says what's the what's so terrible about being pals with Russia and what is so terrible about it [laughter]\nUh Russia does not have any of our interests are doesn't doesn't share our interests and and pretty much in any way a pollutant is a is an absolute author Terry and leader he does terrible thing it's like assassinate a journalist or he essentially has a a gulag system again in the in Siberia and the prisons\nThat why Trump likes him because he fascinates journalists I'm Serious and because of the ... system\nYou know so here's the thing I think Trump is squeamish [laughter] I don't think Trump likes to hear things about the details of of you know a ... murder he ... he doesn't do well with that\nUm he doesn't like the real politic of of having to order people to kill 'em or or have people die on his watches as commander cheap so I think he really hates that stuff but\nShe thinks that he has to like it in sort of a TV movie way okay\nAnd and that's why he likes Trump's he likes that sense of resolve that way like ...\nBecause ... is kind of a movie character yeah All right and I talked about the transatlantic cables and okay we're just um can you comment on\nI guess this is political what kind of political\nDamage or\nEven or help is it when the president talks about love letters to Korea now he fell in love with him all that was ... you know how bad is that or maybe not bad at all\n[noise] I think that that these things have a a deleterious effect but that they're slow moving I think that the real effect that the Trump Administration and these kinds of ah these\nKinds of things like the letters or the sucking up to ... that awful press conference or when he was visiting with food and in Helsinki that that these things are really going to hurt us a decade from now\nBecause what this administration has done\nIs shown the rest of the world that they can't trust the political or moral civility the United states and that they have to now start to\nAdjust their policies to assume that someone like a Trump could come to power again and not back them up in the Baltics or not back them up um ... you know Israel or something like that\nAnd and so it's when everybody else starts moving and doing other things like deciding what we have to you know rearm ourselves um or change our trade agreements in order to prevent the in order to protect against the possibility that the United states is going to violate the norms that it's been following for decades that's when you see the world order start to start to shatter\nSuddenly starting now but I I think it's really bad and twenty thirty\nIs Trumbull one and done style leader or I mean would there be another person like him or are we learning lessons\nAnd to know like I I think that Trump has changed the politics in the U.S and I think\nI'm from here on out you're going to have a character like Trump in our electoral system you're going to have a presidential character that sort of plays that role both on the left and the right that has to be um a larger than life show many kind of character um in order to get elected\nAnd I heard that's a good thing just for giggles can you see anybody\nOn the left that would be that kind of person other than Alec Baldwin\n[laughter] I Can't right now I mean that's the question on the left writers who who's gonna run in twenty twenty I don't see that but I Would but he would be the type and and I and I do think that there's a serious possibility that you have someone coming out of the entertainment world I'm picking up the mantle and trying to run in twenty twenty\nNow Steve Bannon was afraid of Oprah\nDid you have you read that he was series yeah thinking that Oprah she ran for takedown\nTrump\nOh I think that's a real possibility um yeah there's no questions he has more power than Trump does um and she's a serious person right so ... and likable right so she she would be a great candidate in in any number of ways\nBecause you don't have to know how to do everything how do you need to do is find people who knew know how to do everything\nYeah okay she'll she'll put people around her um that are competing yeah how much of a deal is that if Mattis goes [noise] who isn't he replaces him and he was a\n... he was supposed to be the adult in the room and he kind of was a and the president didn't like having a and a dog in the room so\nThat was that a crucial thing madam gets fired\nDepends on who replaces him but yes it would be deeply concerning I I don't think that uh you know mad as a is enjoying the job I think he feels that it's a sense of duty I think it's the same way with John Kelly it was to the the same way with HR McMaster who was asked to revise or for a while that these people sort of stepped up\nAnd to play the role sort of stabilized or public um so I think it's a big deal if he goes\nI really do but I think he's going to try to fight it because he thinks it's a duty to say right he's one of the group of people that\nStay to protect\nThe American people from the president's worst impulses\nYou are right which is what he is accused of saying hey\nNow China we didn't even talking about China so you know you know the moment to talk about China we only have a very short time\nBecause you're such an excellent guess ... or is this the sunset of the United states as the dominant power\n[noise] that is a great question in the field of foreign policy or it might be but it's slow and there's always second and third chances to win a lot of ways\nYet the answer is yes ah that that the rise of China is is basically unstoppable unless she decided to wage major war which we would lose I'm\nUh in the sense that it would cost us more than it would cost them up words just fall apart relation there's like this\nBut China has a long way to go and and the the problem that China faces is is that they're going to ah [noise] they're gonna as the saying goes uh get great before they get rich and so the purchasing power of the average Chinese is still well below the average American um but given that there is you know four hundred million\nOr you know middle class Chinese even if it is well below the average American that equals a a very large economy [noise] um [noise] the problem is is that because the one child policy and other things are going to have a huge chunk of the population aging out at mid century and it's unclear\nIf the Chinese government is going to be able to handle that in terms of healthcare a retirements tastes like the\nFinal question what makes them so successful ... what do they lack restraints are the you know they do they not have restraints on them that we do to keep us from being a successful I mean they're\nGoing to excess all it's a lot that's a big word yeah OK well they're doing very well what's the secret\n[laughter] or in some sense I think that's that's right that they don't have the same kind of regulatory standards that we do so they can experiments um and and try stuff in the loop things and and uh you know kill people and things like that\nBut that a bit more than we can write a and and then they have a command economy so the government can just say\nWe're going to make the sufficient or you know hyper a fast train route and we're going to literally moved towns to do it and they just commanded and it's gets done right or in the United states to take Twenty years of ah you know here he's a lawsuit to do it [noise] um so democracy has slowed and efficient in the short term but in the long term I think it was a\nMan you are a great great guests and you know you're fine and smart and you can come back anytime soon seriously anytime you think I

how does she\nDoes that ring a bell with you in the town that was taken over and made into a nuclear submarine center training center\nAnd a submarine guy you'd probably knows about that right\n\nAh I Do try to extend it for the a bill to flee and to I've been to Latvia next door but I'm afraid that didn't make it a ... and and to the Russians oversee during the Cold War how much it's sobering ... so it doesn't surprise me\nThat you are you found some interesting where you know if I say maybe ... to ... because well oh yeah oh\nIs that still in operation yeah ...\nYeah yeah that's the ... um yeah yeah that's the ... that was the um headquarters of the what used to be called the red vinyl and flee inside ... now\nI'm just an old and ... and I bought an anti submarine bullshit code I chose London and uh we went down the ... the Russian Navy as it was rough thing and a fan inactive is now more active and there's a lot more Russian so brings out of that today than it happen for a long time\nAnd interesting place\nAnd how was it that they allow you to go there because well it must be kind of secret\nYeah yeah it was a newspaper journalist and\nAre in those days are access and ... at the end of the Cold War was and\nI have ... today sending but the real navy and to so I was invited to cover this historic visit it would take is running for um new way to ... to to make the Russians say and set up by the end of the Cold War\nAnd it was at the time they called the hard liners who you know Nineteen Ninety One but they tried to\nType Russia back to Soviet days and we were shot at by Russian submarine or we met Russian warships crofton we wouldn't quite sure what was going to happen\nBut it turned out they were friendly and then we had an exercise of to visiting moment and square that Russia is already fought a practice to pay a little ship obviously they chose London unfortunately I twisted and it was I Would too if I eat they practice to pay do we could've still\n... whole so it was out to visit\nSo how did they invaded what ... what did they do to evade it\nAs well basically what happened was that during the ... with the Russians the enemy realized that they said on\nThis practice to pay that would actually be five I'm at ... so there was a well they called a rule fleets folks that are retiring to a ... with a choice to London and to an end up being a ... and they were both information and suddenly they sold it's um [noise]\nThis red or orange now you're just a practice to pay that which was near the surface of the city because that's how it's being guided by why between about why is it being why guided by some Russian so man\nIs an end to somebody in that we we couldn't see but knew was there on the side you know so they said they already saying starts coming towards\nThe um the British a formation playing or the school vessels in the rain I went to the ... will go to ... and so the the older and they forget it but it's like if I say of action so physically avoided it\nAnd I guess the Russians or both as sobering and somebody was getting\nReady to hate for any I'm putting the uh the Cold War back ... or an amusing incident you might say the time because she mentioned the Russian so man I think you get lost you know I've got one of these ... sites or fortunately the whole coast\nI'm surprised that those those vessels could avoid a wire guided torpedo\n[laughter] yeah well it was probably set noted its maximum speed and\nThen we have to think that the Russians although they were trying to scare was ... plus we actually trying to hit us but it was a practice Topeka that's somewhat different from a an actual tornado in that it doesn't have\nA a warhead and you know blow you up and I think is designed to let you see what they called the track as it comes to would chew so and so I think there was a a fairly good chance of avoiding it was to something that was a surprising to the British you didn't know that that was that she got into hadn't\nDid you actually see it in the water coming at you\nOr I think we saw it flashed by that's where you could say I mean these things happened so quickly in some ways you know even in a way it's happening until there's a sudden ... move and you say somebody what the heck's going on and then you say this kind of already just thing flashing by and that say you ... seconds that's all it takes\nSo we really didn't talk about World War one yet I'm I guess I don't need to talk about that conflict can you can you tell me the difference between you and a submarine is there a difference in what is the difference\nThey all the time I mean ... is the gym for an just say oh okay so ... yeah so I mean you buy 'em in in the boat you know I'm going to talk about you but then I'm just meaning German submarine okay uh it ... the ... really the access so I moved to\nUnload all one have you but it's\nLike you boats had more of a decade to me both like that\nRock of ages anniversaries way North America the just the music of advanced we had been wagon had more\nThan New York times is in the village voice is the most remarkable Broadway theories have are playing by the way we did you get the boxes and we're we're\nLiving in a room\nFor their until during treasures many ethics\nInjured using\nFood for thought we really have died guinea for my ... my ... in the market can you can hang in how you make your way home from the beach and learning about the newly restaurant how the New England in your backyard\nIn front of your car home mobile device put my bigger every Sunday night it takes on WB\nSponsored by Mass General Cancer Center Salem waterfront hotel in sweets Enron was Iranian restaurant\nOn the radio and yeah we we really enjoy your son on the radio [noise]\nBradley this huge we listened to talking and we have a lot to discuss these the news radio ten thirty the bulk of the deadly deep the definitive history of submarine\nWarfare it is very detailed book and we have offered in a ballot die with is thanks for being here\nIt's okay it's good can you give me an idea\nOf how many subs are out there was a nuclear powered subs Gary nuclear warheads how many out there\n\nThat's a very interesting question I mean if you're on a daily basis and I'll just for ... to a calculation in my head and they saw that it'd be very rough or if you ... you said and you can also brings with that\nYes yeah okay let me think um\nSo I Would say you know somebody who's maybe seven eight hope it doesn't say but I Would say there'll be others preparing to go uh met any one time and you're talking about America at usa ah UK France and\nRussia China now and and India is preparing to the old sites who sent to see and you can also brings ... is still very\nExclusive club that runs those massive base um trident fool you can you say a bullet those missiles to try and define it so I'm\nGonna run out and so I Would say a\nVery many at all I Want to be that's one of the country right\nWell yeah I mean ... ... each country will have I mean I'm not\nPrivy to the secret plans of other navies but for example the ah the royal navy has won out there all the time and I'm sure the U.S navy\nHas one or two at the end and one in the Pacific maybe area and one somewhere out there in Atlanta who knows a at any one time maybe more so and then the French have won a sale time\nAnd the Chinese ticket getting one sailed time the Russians one maybe two so I'm depends on what survivable\nUm other ... at some stage is funny and very difficult to do the Chinese for many years didn't really have\nA nuclear submarine seeing the Indians are just starting but any one of those submarines\nCarries a enough explosive path to I Would say and that will really so you don't need a lot of them to do a terrible damage and you hope that I never comes and that's the whole point of a\nNuclear deterrent submarines is to make sure that nobody ever attacks anybody in a major white conventionally and I'll take that that you have to use one is to tell you that it's only two gloomy here but at the end of the story so they they're pretty powerful\nMachine say the most powerful a weapons or that you never want to use the ... invented\n... do you have an idea of how many missiles on rock I tried it and what kind of a nuclear power dry or\nYeah or I suppose you pass it on ... on that but you know fix all pulled the rule navy now probably carries twelve\nA trauma missile submarines to us now you could carry more than that in the ... close but it's it was so submarines and the Russians similar so you're talking about somebody took in any way between twelve sixteen or even up to twenty four ah depending on on the boats\nA and M. H. one of those will have a a multiple a warhead\nTape with just one em explosive will head on the top but I actually saw the casing and once it gets hard enough and his trajectory or above the ... and it will ... and all these multiple maneuver ... heads will come out\nAnd we can't do any anti missile or sorry antibodies to muscle cells that the enemy has\nAn ... so you're talking multiple warheads on each missile so that's why you don't need many of these\nVessels at sea touchy goals\nThe destruction so I was just a multiple you know getting\nInto our heads on 'em or are they do they have a different target are the same token\nI think we'll be talking to you know they're very sophisticated and to\nGet into it and it these days you know you could well be sitting in a city now\nSo I could buy those on the list of let's say the Russian\nBut it's the missiles ... right now there was a time\nOff to the Cold War when it's the talk it and so they didn't have specific targets that was certainly the case for the royal navy in my country and I'm not so sure that would be the case but you'd have to ...\n... ... ... in about a minute yeah in about a minute is there is their doomsday program such that say\nRussia is totally destroyed and unable to wage any sort of war\nThat automatically down there that that is that a nuclear submarine is set up to shoot off islands missiles in the event that the host country has destroyed as doomsday safety device\nYeah you can do just try and stuff I don't know I ... I mean they may be every submarine\nHow old is on board they open when they give it to so that they could have something that's just on the trigger because the thing you need to have come under control from the show so it has to be somebody let the president and the prime minister\nIn Russia the president who has to keep that old throws I sent the codes a thing to have\nThat just some old ... take a response to anything would be\nWould be absolutely ... and I don't know I don't know if anybody these days is still believes that this is an evil ability and in reality in nuclear war tool out of it you can survive and you could water there was any way in my opinion\nThe type to live with your table they're all papers to Canada with low you would have seen you can use the firm on my point of view of the year she going to end up escalating everything\nSo mostly I Would say that it's probably a dangerous oh you're either going to trigger\nBut it was he a free so marine captain how old is in a safe\nAboard the vessel that they must open and then read folks from the very the very top posts and saying\nIn the event and you say well far all missiles or don't foreign ...\nRight now that's interesting I Love to read that in that one time I really appreciate your time author of the deadly deep definitive history a submarine warfare and there's a whole lot more in it than we covered is a\nBig book would love it makes a lot of you\nThank you thanks for having me\nAbsolutely six one Seventy five or ten thirty is open lines again and it will be for the rest of the night only

trying to scare you\nThe\nNurse staffing ratio is important having too many patients makes it more likely the nurse well harm you by accident it puts your life and your house at risk\nHaving a nurse be too busy they cannot take care of you\nTo many patients they cannot take care of you the answer would be to have enough nurses and the answer to that would be higher more nurses but they don't because they don't want to pay they would rather have your life be in jeopardy\nThan have to hire more nurses so what they do is they say well if we're forced to have a certain ratio well then we won't be able to have as many patients no that's not it hire more nurses don't have fewer patients\nYou're rich your big business you're massively rich\nHire more nurses others is should do is force them to take a little bit less profit and protect your life that you can protect your health better in California in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSomething similar was done and the result is that mortality has dropped\nTwo years after implementation California staffing and patient care outcomes were compared to those in other states using two experts selected indicators whatever comparisons ... in fact\nNurses had fewer patients which is good because the staffing demonstrated significantly lower mortality everybody knows it if nurses are too busy patients die they get injured yet the big business\nDoesn't want to pay the money to address that and they pay a lot of money for these commercials to mislead you and and they don't say\nAnything about hiring more nurses they just say well if we're going to have staffing levels we can't have as many people in your weight in the ... know hire more nurses your rich\nI'm voting yes I'm disappointed that the healthcare industry would\nSubvert the truth like that they don't they they they sort of eliminate from the possibility the idea of hiring or nurses when that is the point\nNurses know\nSix months having to fight for ten thirty where do you think people are smart people it's that asked me Bradley ... which are they doing this and I tell them and they say well I was thinking of going no sake why will I saw those advertisements those commercials they're wildly misleading\nTo short patient in the hallway and people don't stop to think oh they think is if I ... vote yes then there'll be patients more patients in the hallway\nNo man we need them to hire more nurses\nYou also having too many patients puts nurses license in jeopardy 'cause they get the cannot take correct care of patients it puts nurses license in ... in jeopardy that's right the healthcare industry does that do they care no they don't\nI guess not they don't seem to be interested in the staffing ratios so think hire more nurses don't take longer wait times\nThey want you to fit the the big business ... longer wait times\nBut it's about hiring more nurses six one Seventy five or ten thirty seven it'd be easy I'll say oh I repeat that

an\nOpportunity I was I was loading up by next a version of the J talking I guess in order to everybody get the tree talking implied tested boxed them absolutely awesome much thatch the mark of all it's a given that shameless plug\nI had an opportunity a list of your colleague Gatorade and he hosted a a debate between those four question why those against question one yeah and I listen to an article I guess I don't get to listen to the dead sugar gets usually try to get some sleep that point in time\nI caught his podcast swan whereas I was getting yours and he had um\nI Believe it was a woman ... bull bull persist\nNurses but one it was involved with the nursing association and one was not and then they both abruptly opposing points of view and ... just a it's a full disclosure I'm voting yes on question one in this particular case and I'm looking at it for a prospective where\nThe nursing staff thing when may get short and it's not just a situation where oh we need the flexibility of the problem that they have it gets you just like you said earlier they don't have enough there's this and in some cases the hospitals\nRefused to hire enough nurses exactly alive you that the staffing is correct that's it that's the whole thing\nThey exactly and and I also have a little bit of a personal interest in this my brother's daughter is Carly ... she's studying for her BSN which we speak so you know\nThe person on the opposing side one of the things that they tried to do here was that well if we have this ... day ban\nIt situation acts where nurse Jones\nWith no sun you don't get vitamin D production you don't get mullet\nTone in production and that\nIt can send you out of whack you know we're all in the same boat here those folks stay up overnight it's not healthy but we can't help it and there's a lot of benefits true sometimes I think she would be good to work\nIn the day but there are a lot of benefits to the overnight autonomy for one I'm\nCompletely one thousand percent autonomous in even ways I don't want to be like Mark it's me and mark for much of the night it's almost too much autonomy gets hit autonomy can bleed into the loneliness we could do at Saddam is\nA I think well you know what I'd really like to do a morning show get up at whatever time people give up to\nI guess I'm a big preparers are I'd probably get up early go in there and it you know you start you work in the morning it seems something how for you about that like a farmer\n\nMorning show people get up about the same time as farmers I guess a little earlier\nYou start work when the sun comes up you get out still no traffic what'd you you're out of there what ten they probably have some busy work for you to record some stuff\nWalking around hanging out say hello to everybody I don't know it seems like that'd be fun\nI have to balance though the ... the stresses of\nInteraction with people during the day and the traffic and the bright lights at all with the un healthiness of the overnight I don't know which is worse for you there's a certain calming\nI mean it's really nice being in the studio now nice and\nCalm I didn't put my fireplace on my screen like I did last night\nI should have done that [noise] speaking of life I must say that after our guest Doug area and who's a astronomer\nCosmologist have light ... of course he's at a stronger ... enemy the Malay there is a\nLesson you can see in the sky so he has a\nThing about liked he doesn't like it but he particularly doesn't like computer light and we had a long talk about it the blue light to high energy light that comes out of\n... monitors computer monitors TVs now it really has an effect I've cut way back on it and since I have I really noticed like computer monitors really messing with your head to their so bright I'm Still looking for\nMonitor covers like monitor filters blue blue blocking monitor filters there you go there\nToo expensive I'm looking for a roll of some Joe or film that I can cut the shape\nAnd just put 'em up\nClams on the screen is just a little pressure clams 'cause I'm looking at this white screen that when it's not good I have tried to find they do have software that you can install it changed the color profile\nAway from blue I Would like to do that I'm not able to be some reason I Can't loaded into these company I Would never tried a loaded into the company computer 'cause that would get fired for that but\nI Can't even figure out how I Would do it I don't want to I'd rather not use third party stuff and I believe that embedded within windows is\nA way to change the color profile but I Can't figure it out so I think that's that's very important and I think it's very important for people who work overnight to pay attention to\nTheir circadian rhythms and how sunlight effects and now the daylight savings thing is going to change and it's going to be even weirder right now I can get up and go outside of my body thinks oh its day kind of like a little bit of morning I'd pretty soon I sleep with retired he mostly doc\nFor folks in say Iceland\nIf you're going to Iceland in November ... it just goes up kinda I dunno like maybe Fifteen degrees over the horizon not much just look at the sun goes it's it's always either kind of\nMurky morning or murky afternoon\nIt's pretty weird that gives us a blue quality up there a lot of snow and no trees in\nTrees in Reykjavik they used them all\nThey used them all\nSix one Seventy five or ten thirty if you'd like to give me a show [noise] [noise] Oh yes Elizabeth Warren ... a word and Elizabeth Warren and this is not being pro war or against Warren I'm simply observing\nI think she made a catastrophic mistake for her career by having
