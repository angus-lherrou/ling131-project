work together\nSo don't worry about it\nWith a lower court shows ... we were purchased ... it's called\nYeah we'll we'll SPEED Center Yeah Yup yup so that but so it's got abs\nAnd there's a wheel speed censoring it tells the computer how fast the wheels of turning that's how the abs works\nSo when ... when it measures like the speed of the car versus the speed of the wheel it said if there's

drives fine until you're out into the higher gear and then I had that one with a I'm a ... going up and up and there weren't going anywhere\nAh okay so it's slipping into higher gear that's what's happening Yeah Yup that's not good [laughter]\nSo I'm ready for that is not good at it may be time this and that thing down the road now you can you can have those transmissions rebuilt um and I do believe there are a ton of money but you know a transmission rebuild that's a major investment\nUm you know eat regardless I mean you have to kind of money means to grant might be it might be two grand but that's you know two grand for a car that's worth three grand\nIf that is probably not is probably not worth it\nYou know one that got\nMe on ... on a rare breed yeah replace some ... five hundred dollars just for the pops because hitting\nI'm not I feel so Rob by Toyota actually out or is it like ... or more money I found a place for five hundred dollars cheaper than Toyota\nHonda so

she doesn't drive and a lot of my wages your driving you could you could probably get away with it for a while so so is it actually I should ask this\nIs it only in it's only in the highest gear so if you can try it out of overdrive does it slip at all it doesn't slip in any other gear\nNo no I mean sometimes the older shows up on on a shelf store you know what I mean on a fun thing to do the show

there's no evidence other than the testimony of Dr Ford when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh I I totally get that\nAnd you know perhaps the whole thing shouldn't have come up\nPerhaps it should because as

enough scrutiny of anyone really when it comes to that job and and this case certainly not so I don't have any problem with lots of scrutiny and even though a normal person a normal situation should

kind of wrong even if you're you know hard core supportive at the president would use his office\nTo make fun of someone everyone agrees was sexually assaulted like how can that be a good thing to do

know not supporting any prejudices that was good luck on your station for a long time ... here anyway\nI'm your ah your point about the judge nominee\nA you know yeah I Do think it's a\nBad thing it'd be mocking people do this for\nA living like that for sure like which president lock the disabled guy so I mean that's the main issue now is this is this is\nA nominee and my thought about that is\nUh the bottom line is not so much what he did one way to Seventeen blackout or Seventy they'll do what they're doing you know I don't think we do this and are you do not know because he may have blackout that for kids do it or Seventeen it'll go their alcohol very well but the question is does he blackout now\nThe question or draw a line between I get that kind of stuff and the time that he has been running in her life for a public service\nThat's partly because if he could not that draw a line of cases like sheets waste it could be subject to a reckless behavior like they all along and people\nVoting thing or if you have to live and be able to show there's an interesting\nWas that it now and you can draw a line actually well up for this year I stopped doing that are in that year I could eat or to always remember\nThat I think he'd be immune from any complaints that what he did what he was young from all of a a a fire truck that totally wrong now so the issue of the more capacity or for quality to uh\nTo drink to excess to a Buddhist so ... ... a long time ago okay good that's fair point\nHow about\nThe ability to tell the truth today what if you find out that he doesn't blackout now but he did blackout before any new ... and he lied about it\nYeah I Can't tell the truth about his path to the the the blackout and instead of drawing the line at the time he just lied about it but he would be a someone who is not being honest about what it categorically a role in our shoulders and protect the highest court or\nA dual our work myself so I understand how judges and lawyers workers\nThe attorney and all that work so I understand that are having no integrity or having it I can see to be in denial is not a privilege to some of that pushes should have but if he you know ... feet why that would be\nTo me very very damaging and if he gets a bigotry rationalize not why this fervor for shading in a way which is not clear clear ally that I think it would be\nOkay to get past this kind of like how badly he lied if you did and then uh 'cause he's still blackout that he's still lose consciousness to control himself and if you go out as qualified either then of course it would be a are there other factors that qualify I think we all know that within a week or so\nAlso very good and what about his behavior towards explode shower attack asking her if she has a drinking problem about laid off\nKind of like the ... that was very classy with all of your probably like that when they know what they're supposed to be asking the question is after the fact that there's a lot of you yeah that was not that that that that really well and it's it it was a bad\nA or a bad a reflection on him that he would get labeled as calmly cool he said well actually I did or I\nI Do or have or whatever and just saying well you it's almost like saying what the question she asked is a\nIs to be try filled with and that that was not a good\nDisplay I don't know if it's disqualify categorically or if it's disqualify incremental leads you add on the question about what they told the truth and the question to be able to pass that might be you know one more Charlotte camel's back it was not good whether it's sports qualify by itself\nI don't know whether it was qualified combinations are things that that was our question it's quite serious because that's not the way you behave or your author of scrutiny to turn the tables on someone who's not under scrutiny\nFairness and now not not to be I'm not trying to find fault here I'm just trying to\n[noise] I'm not with you but the president's strategy of beating up on\nDr Ford\nIs that an effective political strategy I mean he didn't he got elected and no one's already good maybe maybe it is it just doesn't seem like it to me\nOh you mean Trump though yeah which which trial I don't\nThink I don't think Trump is very diplomatic he's being may be good for business but I think he could cause a problem\nWhat about ... blaming all elected again as you do think that going out and mocking\nThe a duck to Ford is is that an effective campaign strategy\nI think when you mock or what do you market disabled person like in the beginning of his campaign only a few people can relate to it but if you're a woman was a victim of that almost everyone because there's a couple of something like that he sees mocking the three for some of the electorate maybe more off half of that it's not not all white\nSo I say it's good for business that's one thing but if he covers the troubling to visually yes may not be worth the trouble you know the conservative we will do this\nBut if comedy the comedy is going well they might still looked at me as long as a ruined on what would be a lot of people right across

know kind of want to make the point\nOf um ... blocking thing um\nI think I think basically what what he's saying which I happen to agree with that\nIf I walked into anywhere a police station with that amount of evidence that this woman had and and staying at the end that way\nThere's nothing that could be done right so I you know I I don't think it's up costs no attack on her right that get to a an attack on you know some you know people coming in with total lack of evidence you know trying to ruin the skies\nKorea I think it's an attack on her\nI'd I don't I don't I don't believe it is\nI mean how would you know I'm not I mean how is it not even\nHad gone to [noise] well do you think it was it was one of them I'll do it\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know\nWas it and I don't know where's the house [noise] upstairs downstairs where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember\nI mean how is that in any way in any state on any planet and not a personal attacks on\n... because I think that everything that he stated right is exactly what she said is that correct no but it it's not so much so we ... we had that evidence\nChris in earlier pointed out that his mocking is not accurate mocking but it's I think perhaps\nUh the fact that it's the style\nI mean that makes it personal but that says style which the when and how do you agree I agree with that probably all day long like I said I I never back anything up that I you know I\nI Do I think you know she is a cruel cars I met at hot you know I I Can't I Can't answer that question you know but what what\nI can use on at that question\nWell because like I say that I think I have a lot of people that I watch my life that you\nKnow they did so heavily you know into the conduct change when they're speaking it's almost like they're screaming to you\nAnd you know I Can't look at that person and say you know a lot of issues such an angry miserable person you know 'cause I understand that he's just trying to get something that costs you know\nUm that that that's that's how I'm looking at that I don't think he's personally attack on the woman I'm and I do believe that something definitely did happen which are\nI'm I'm a victim um\nAnd you know I I I was I was seven years old and I I happen\nI'm fortunate to remember everything about it\nUm time gate quakes I can tell you how the weather was that day um and I had no ... but you know like I like I said I mean I I just you know and the thing with Kavanaugh\nRight um I you know what time we bottling that you know after that many investigations that that man had what proven false accusations I think that would be a little bumped out of shape also\nYeah but you know you're trying to get a job in which you have to behave in ... and the men are exactly the opposite that he may have a quick question how would you like it if the president made fun of you and your ah what happened to you sexually\nKeep it said car suddenly called old I'm\n... same thing every day of the exact same thing or if he had the exact\nSame if it like I said I looked for with as he was trying to get another going across 'cause I really believe that\nYou know it's the point you say is not a personal attack he's trying to get a point across\nYeah I I I basically I think I I Believe that you know he's trying to say okay so if a if a person who walks in right to any any way to\nYou know tell them about an assault as serious as ... and they don't have the details to back it up than what you know why should they remove this guy\nSo I'm getting fair enough you know if if he had said it like that then you'd have a point but he didn't say he said it in a personal attack\nI'm a I Am I turned a the in July this year and I am not only appalled like disgusted with a government listening last Thursday I was in ... times so disgusted with Feinstein\nThat woman should be thrown out of Congress and the shame to her which using\nThis pull him and Christine ... is a political football and Lee I chose that member on election night friendly he said he'll upset he was glad that hill and he didn't get in\nBut you know a little disappointed that on Donald Trump was president but ill gave him a chance and you should\nAnd every time he does something good you know announced praises him\nThat's not true at all I Know it was totally not true I as a matter of hey I'm a born and buy a you're not getting him while he yes this is the day that he needs knocking\nOkay but also can I say something about we also elected I didn't but the country elected Clinton who raped and prove in\nSeveral women and what she did to Monica Lewinsky was disgusting if I was in tears back then that she was the age of my daughter and handle is the president of the United states still in the sky is the thing and then sell off\nRight I get that we are very that was terrible I'm not sure why that keeps coming up but yes it was terrible terrible\nWell the thing is we're always saying about discussing things that have been drum up about this plea judge I mean he's a he's a decent man and people in manufacturing\nAll these lies about him and also Christine forward it's going to suffer what's happening here and not only to judge Kavanaugh about what's happening I Believe what happened to when I was a young woman I had a family member\nWho did things to me but I finally just threaten my mother I Would tell my mother and he stopped it\nAnd I stopped dead and it's tough\nTo women and for some ... and you know I'm sad is that all the young men nowadays Betty Betty White cilia\nBecause again in high school I even know what I never drank the ... men and it gets things some women in high school 'cause I Know some girls back then\nIt's coming back to bite them anywhere and that side of disgusting and\nI don't really believe I Believe ... ... something did happen to her but it's quite clear and now to say that judge cabinet I did it is a big question my care\nAnd under Clinton President Clinton there was no question what happened to him this woman was proven\nGuilty he was guilty of raping them soap opera came out so nice strong will remember Barbara the people of this country did elect\nPresident [laughter] advocate proven he raped women and you know this is sad it's sad time and I I'm Sorry I'm embarrassed that I Am in American citizen because listening last Thursday was disgusting\nSo big range of beef is with Diane Feinstein yes yes we lose the I did do exactly that was that ...\nShe doesn't know what to ... she did check it came around and ask a aids that was\nThe you mostly find fault with\nThat a letter was sent to her that supposedly was a ... you know there's something behind what happened to Christine full and\nBecause I like to see her bank account where they sell the if the eyes checked that maybe not right now but she's gonna be a rich lady\nSo what is your implication what do you say rather what does that mean [laughter]\nThere's somebody behind on this\nAnd saying that someone paid her to make this up\nNot make it up to divulge and also the other woman that supposedly have come out there's no proof there because the FBI hasn't even gone to them so something very fishy yeah\nSo you just kind of guessing that maybe somebody pay her to do this\nYes has to come out this and that led to really and this is all\nYou don't think she would have just simply
