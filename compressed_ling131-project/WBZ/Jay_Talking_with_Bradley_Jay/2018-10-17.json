I Know I'm a ... and we've learned a lot and a lot about how we've inspired to make on the animal a lot of the ... the equal but I you know sharing the term used for the kinds of Eli\nI'm Wondering in your book you're talking about how the uh pre made since ... and ... on the structure of the sons of Italy\nWell I don't ... necessarily mentioned the ... the free masons in the book itself the sense of Italy itself had actually been found as was mentioned by you know a tally in Americans coming to the new world and\nDr ... who was somebody in a lot of ways to created something and he uses the terms liberty equality fraternity which could be correlated\nBut I think it a lot of ways the free masons themselves were much older organization I mean that they dated to the turn of the nineteenth century in Boston a call so have the grand lodge free masons\nBut you realize in some ways that this was something that was primarily more of an ethnic organization it wasn't something that actually talked about a broader sense\nBut what it did was to create a grand lodge of which than they were familiar lodges that were actually established so I think in some ways you're right they still have a correlation but I don't think there was any direct connection between the free masons and the sons of visually\nThanks Jeff thank you know\nYou see free nations who came in saying shortly after Eighteen hundreds you\nKnow even before because Paul Revere would actually service cursed grand master of the grand lodge of masons\nSo you know today when we look at the building but it's at the corner with us today trombone street in Boylston Street it's the ... of course it's\nThe right decision the original one bird to the ground the masons and the nineteenth century or bargainer fraternal organization that stole the virtues of liberty and equality\nBut Paul Revere was a major part of that but you do you what do you think of Paul Revere I mean he was ...\nBut he who was the patriotism of amity man he he was a he was the person that was very much into espionage and secrets and whatever that he has up well with amazingly\nWell he was also somebody who was Korea or he brought the Suffolk Resolves from built into Philadelphia and they were incorporated into the declaration of independence\nBut in the period of the Seventeen nineties when they were evolving into this free Mason aspect\nHe was the silver Smith and what does he do but he made all the jewels for the Mason file and today there still is a collection the masons were also given a lot of hair from Martha Washington when President George Washington died and Seventeen Ninety eight\nAnd of course Paul Revere made it a little ... a solid gold um earn that actually hold Seoul block of hair where's that it's actually in the masons museum I mean it's a wonderful aspect to have to realize is also museum and conquer too but\nThe grand lodge masons is something that I I always see them I I teach also at the urban college Boston and I parked the a very street garage\nAnd that's where the masons park so it was the men and did a jackets and I've always intrigued and I wanted to initially where are these men going and then of course I realized it was the ... I have to\nUh put on my map cap\nMay sonic lodge corner of Boylston ... Sam coming out of the Boylston Street T. station then we use that corner as a starting place where is it your back would be to the common asking\nDirectly across the street yeah so on one side of the ... and the other side of the Starbucks okay so it's basically I'm just to the right of the low cinema\nSo but it's it's an important feature to ... and I think Jeffrey is correct in some ways it's a correlation but I don't think they went directly related in any way but I think a lot of ways they they did the same type of thing they do outreach charitable organizations scholarships\nDo you want to talk about what\nI'm Talking about my life I'm Talking about more I'm Talking\nWe read lead you to be easy review in dirty WVU\nJ talking and we with Anthony ... Abbas in your story and he's got he's written I'd say eighty two or three it's fuzzy now books because you're just one just came out and you just submitted another one\nAnd it's ongoing he's turning them out at the new ready to talk about little a child in American history with ... in low here we go hey Laila\nHey how are you a jet Bradley Jay and Anthony\nIowa well\nI I'm doing pretty well I talk a little bit more about print the Getty if I could sure um I remember when I was um when I was younger we had a a print the Getty was had a matter of fact shrink plant and all correct\nAnd um they uh had a wonderful restaurant there I can remember um when I was younger my parents wouldn't you know get all dressed up and they would go and then I as I got older um they ... they gave me the chance to go with them and then when I was dating I used to go with my boyfriend to the um\nPrints are to the point I think it was called the prince grotto rod\nAnd and they had gotten all types of things I can remember the ... the un chap when my father came home one night he said he had frogs legs I think to myself much meter frogs like my gosh what the heck is he\nI couldn't figure that out but um it was a great little place and ... and in point quite a few people here in the end of the uh low on and the ground so beautiful I can remember driving through were driving into the restaurant and it was always these lovely flowers and I guess they had a ... a caretaker named John Walter case sick I think his name was if I remember\nAnd he he had worked at print the Getty all his life and down and uh he he uh he uh had worked his way up and had hired a caretaker I guess it just do the flowers and keep the flowers in the ground impeccable they had a\nFountain and it was just it was such a great place on but it ...\nIn a in the late nineties the recording I guess was that now I think it was born and had taken over there\nThey um the manufacturing plant in Nineteen eighty something I I Can't remember exactly\nAbout prince was it did start print street in the north end but eventually the la ... family and then later by the time of World War two the company really took on new meeting when Joseph Pellegrino at a gun in some ...\nHis name I couldn't think of what his name [laughter] I Would agree\nAnd I was at Harvard but my father and I think one of the things is he was somebody who really market at the company and he became in some ways about justice spokesperson but he made print spaghetti almost ... because it was a household name there were many other manufacturers have dried pastas\nBut bell agreed it was somebody who has a lot of ways not only moved in of course created that wonderful factories law\nBut employed hundreds of people of all walks of life I mean they weren't Italian or Italian Americans there were everyone\nIn what he was trying to do in some ways was to make it into something that became a typical thing and I think they're campaigned in the Nineteen late sixties Nineteen seventies to create that bridge spaghetti night Wednesday that Boston was a masterpiece yes because it well it\nIt definitely it definitely was molded into the city of all I mean even at a ... breadth that said welcome to spaghetti bill I mean and that science had been there for years and years I'm not sure if they had that they've taken it down yet or not I I drive by their constantly but I don't really notice it 'cause it's just part of the woodwork for me\nI Hope they didn't because they think in a lot of ways this is something that wasn't just a place that was a factory that employed people to make macaroni\nIt was a lifestyle and it was a grouping of people that their livelihood depended upon it whether or not it became board and eventually which is\nHere you know there's something that creates this business that we realize that we can go into a supermarket wherever we are at sea print macaroni ... spaghetti ... fettuccine\nIt's something that is so important that we take for granted that at the turn of the twentieth century this ethnic foods which was really the the\nFood that people enjoy that a daily basis probably was something that was being introduced to people of all walks of life so it's\n... yeah I think it yeah well you mentioned about how um [noise]\nIt employed on not only Italians that people have many ethic backgrounds have it forwarded on the on the Portuguese neighborhood here in the law which is where my husband grew up in the flat it was in the name of it really was in a neighborhood where they called the sacred hot or the grove or there was another section which she bought it\nWhich had caught the bleach me because of the factories and roll\nAnd um it's funny that you say about this to get into um Monica on many of them as the older I'm entrenched people who grew up in shaker had area or which we call it the grove\nHated it when it was called to fail because they want it didn't want it to take over what they they knew their neighborhood can be at the grove\nBut many many Portuguese an Irish people I work at ... yes I mean and then their children grow up and worked there for years and years and it was just it was a shape of the city and call it ... it it really did\nIt crippled a lot of people and and a lot of people were out of work at that time\n... thank you so much for the call I Do want to meet Jean arrived park in before the news I say hello to Anthony gene\nOh hello Anthony how fat and I it's nice to talk to you [noise] how\nHigh there and I wanted to ask Anthony opinion on what I find someone hasn't met that's already but the fact that they're cancelling Columbus Day and so many towns and cities I'm due to the I don't want that replacing it with indigenous day but it just seemed like a slap in the face\nTo Italians and just Columbus Day I'm I'm\nAstonished myself I I basically look at Columbus Day or something but I've always known and I I of course have visited the purported grave of Columbus and I think sometimes in a lot of ways he's somebody that we've known for generations so to speak\nWhether or not he was the person who found the new world think he was on the way to the route to India or not\nI think in some ways it's something that's really quite peculiar and I've come to the conclusion and a lot of ways that when I hear the mayor's the specific cities it's actually to become an indigenous day\nI Begin to wonder is there something else if one could do such as the other Sunday in October the indigenous day\nBut there seems to be a sense and a lot of ways that we are changing our culture in some ways to accommodate others and to make them feel good or basically to include them so is the one that\nChanges I think if I forgetting this really attacking American day they're thinking of it strictly is oh Columbus was a long time ago they're not ... they're not realizing what it means to be a talent\nTo do we change the name of a school in Boston and I think sometimes why should we change the name of a holiday I think you're right it is a slap on the face and it is somewhat offensive because I think in some ways\nThis aspect of the sons of Italy is so imperative and many aspects because it's not only the protection of China you know the name but it's also the fact of tried to make people understand who was Columbus and what did he do\nI've heard these stories um the various radio programs [noise] oh he was financed by the king and queen of Spain and of course he was where else would have gotten the money to actually have a three ships\nYou know I think in a lot of ways that was taught when I was a child to the schools but I think we need today to actually look at this and realize each one of us contribute to our fabric of society\nGenes from Hyde Park and ride we get to and that's a great point if anybody else wants to take aim at that question feel free\nSix one Seventy five for ten thirty if you don't want to pay the toll its\n...

D. to mentor and I heard radio station\nIn some ways met at St Leonard's because the preponderance walls most of them lived at that time Boston I don't think it had anything to do per se with the Italian American community\nBut it was probably something that was a away aspect to St Francis so I'm not sure about it and it's\nI think in a lot of ways that might be something that I'll do a little bit of research so few do Facebook please send me your email and I'll do as much research was confined to get to that info\nThat would be wonderful I really appreciate that simply because as I said I never know much about it and listening to you and I thought well this is a time to us so I Will email you and messenger yell at ... ... email you\nSo how did she get it started I'll put it Facebook

happened\n... let me know because I think that's one of the fun things would we begin to realize I mean it's not just the fact of the sons of Italy and I've called St Leonard's but\nI think we have to realize in some ways the the fabric of life is connected in many different ways whether it's Roman Catholic or its charitable organizations that fundamentally is supported over the century it's an important feature to realize that touches upon all of our lives so thank you how\nIt might have said something to do it with her son my uncle because he had a specific problem at my grandmother was

today how you doing tonight hello ... yes we are well thank you\nOkay I'm Bradley if it's okay I did my actual thing why I write up the questions I leave it up to chance or whatever you want to answer OK\nI'm Rita questions and your cancer\nWhat I mean why ... what wait for in a row is a lot to remember like the first question that let's do one of\nThe though but that's the thing\nYou're ... or something just answer wine or two or\nWhatever I I Will do the best we can go ahead\n[noise] question why ... what are the top three things most county in\nQuestion kale dream last comment stakes keep on\nThree top three favorite most people do it\nAnd the question what three square they say\nThat's like a twelve questions\nAll right I'll take the ... three when we go to Italy which we usually do every fall but this year we couldn't go because of health reasons but we go to Italy I think one of the things is of course the eternal city is wrong I Love him and we said the same hotel which is a hotel for him\nIt's directly opposite the forum and um basically it's the most wonderful place and the restaurants are great\nBut I think one of the concepts is though I enjoy Venice and I enjoy Florence and I enjoyed Naples [noise]\nOne of the things we like to do is we rent a villa and send out of the camino which is about a hundred and twenty five miles southwest of a southeast of a room and we stay there at least a week and I always things sometimes visiting the countryside of Italy is the most wonderful thing\nSo granted urban cities are really lovely and things of that sort but I really liked to see the countryside how people really live how they live\nEat drink and of course enjoy and socialize with one another\nI think in some ways I'm very proud to be an Italian American I'm only Hof um I think in some ways I've looked at my family in some ways and I said\nWhat have we done to contribute back to you know the fabric of society in Boston and I think we've done a lot\nI've heard a lot of history books and they don't just touch upon my family's history but they touch upon everything of Boston's history from the period of sixty Verde to the president [noise] so when I think about the evolution of the city's history\nBegan to realize that I'm probably one of those folks and the wheel in one of thousands of people have a lot of ways that I have an ethnic religious or racial background but in some ways has now melted into what we call a Bostonian\nI think in some ways I'm very proud of being that but it's also the fact of what else can I Do to make it better so that each one of us feel as though we're part of that fabric of society\nAlright phase these films I don't know I really do but it's fun in some ways to think what ... what are we who are we we're if we come from that's when I'm always trying to do as a historian so I think sometimes the sons of Italy book it's a great example of that for ... what what it's done\nDo you consciously tried to keep the Italian in you alive keep the Italian this interview upfront\nI don't really necessarily think of myself as anything other than myself I mean it's only a fabric of who I Am um I also have white hair I also have a lot yeah yeah\nBut I think one of the don't merrily self identify about what I Try to do sometimes is to reconnect with things that were fond memories for the past and I think I mentioned earlier\nMy grandmother did make pasta one of your earlier callers that talked about doing the posture and he his grandmother put it on wax paper on the bed my grandmother put under the clean she\nBut the other thing was to my grandmother also made something that I sometimes make on occasion which meatballs\nEveryone knows what a meatball is but I don't think anybody really realize sometimes what they were and my grandmother may with raisins and ... yeah I don't do that and I knew they were ... beautiful but it was so odd when I was a child that I thought this is really

country [noise]\nCuts rewrite federal yes you know that anybody\nHas any smart goes here with us to help celebrate talking about things are telling an American and I'm referring to his book the sons of Italy of which you're a member\nYes I think it a lot of ways when I realized that the grand lodge has so many familial lodges that it's a very important feature of the ... which I Belong to a very active and it's a fun group of people very lovely people that are a lot of ways\nYou know are still stolen the virtues of what it was when it was founded in Nineteen fourteen\nYou talked about one area of Italy the like and I bet you've got bend to others since we're talking about Italy and you might as well share that sort of a to another area of Italy\nWell I think one of the concepts is I mean we travel I rent a car and especially in Rome\nAnd in many ways I go to where we tend to go but then I loved to lose myself within the countryside\nAnd I think sometimes when my aspects is I Love the area in and around Naples apple you know send a NATO bell to communicate in front of the known\nThose are the areas in some ways that you begin to realize you can go to a small shop by bred by cheese a bottle of wine and simply sit on a hillside look out onto this country that has the most fascinating place but in some ways is\nSimilar but very dissimilar to Italian American culture a Boston you know Rome is a very sophisticated city but in the countryside in some ways\nI Try to understand what people are saying and blow by Italian is halting I think in many ways I've learned in some ways to look at not only how they live or they worship how they shop\nBut basically to go to the cafes and interact with people and it's a fascinating tool so to speak of the entire aspect so you've\nDefinitely been to a pump pay and Oh yes her ... that's right in your area and what about uh like ...\n... is absolute can you was grab that are the people well you know if you think of\nHillsides but these hillsides populated with houses to send to the ocean is just incredible ... of the most picturesque especially at sunset you begin to say in some ways what is Italy and what is Chiquita terror\nIt's suddenly going a lot of ways that arriving during the day is lovely it's a great aspect but then you begin to realize that the evening as lights begin to come on the ocean itself is simply lapping up the shoreline\nDinner and a drink is the most wonderful thing but I think if you know chink would tear my very favorite it's right off the coast of Italy is capri [noise]\nSo when we go to ... we always stay at ... ... which is the very top of prey\nSo in many instances they were not only hotels but small pet jailed has and will stay with them in the food is quite good but enjoying a drink as you overlook the ocean which you're up hundreds of feet overlooking the Atlantic\nOf the Mediterranean Sea it's something that's just magical\nWithout during be a ... an absolute martini straight up the queen of\n[laughter] like [laughter] vodka is pretty rare sometimes in Italy and I will usually either have I'm\nA very simple drink with Jim or even whiskey but I think a lot of ways I'm always astonished week we couldn't find Jamieson whiskey for our lives in Rome until I went to the capital G. Fiore one time I rented a villa\nIn Rome it was enormous don't ask me why did it but it was right on the Victoria ... well halfway between the capital Fiore and I thought it a lot of ways it was nice\nSo they said it was the second floor [noise] so I so great that's perfect so second floor was actually the third floor\nAnd it was nice units it had three bedrooms was huge living space overlook the area was ... but it had a hot water tank which was maybe ten gallons a year or so every time we did this we had to go up the stairs to press the button that it was ...\nBut I I thought it would be fun to cook and this unit and I went to the capital to fury daily to buy fresh pasta fresh vegetables that we buy different things and I thought to myself wow this is getting expensive and then I found two days before we left the supermarket that was up the street\nSays ... half the price and\nThe pastor that I spent something like seven euro's fall for one pound was one year\nThe fact that Pete and revere I pay your on WB the ones having to fight for ten thirty for anybody else to give us a shout I beat\nHer skinny then yes you're always very and former often that I I just had a crush of a car a statue\nYes a actually a comment on the question okay sure and a rhino why\nIs partly they're facing changed even when he's affiliated with the old notch a Christ Church behind them there is a reason for that I just wanted a fantasy who's very knowledgeable by the way if he heard about this\nAnd I think in some ways you look at that and you realize that doctor dean ... who's the president of outlawed dj attracted to these people who were the movers and shakers not only of their day but kind of been a lot of ways people that have contributed to the fabric of Boston\nSo when do you think about governors and mayors and other photographs that show people along not just with the pope but also Bernard ... caught the law\nThe book itself shows the gamut of people who either members of the sons of mentally or associated in some way with it because as we've said I'm In one of the earlier callers mentioned\nThat this was a major feature of what the law is represented liberty equality fraternity and it was something that during that period of the early twentieth century\nThey had a ... magazine and the magazines itself was published monthly and then the period of a Nineteen teens twenties thirties and forties\nHalf was an English and half was in the Taliban\nAnd they began to realize that the cover which always have the lie of the sons of Italy which represented the champion of the Italian Americans always ruin the presence of his sons of Italy not only had that magazine that was read by thousands of people on a monthly basis\nBut they even had the loyalty oath of the sons of Italy in America that was written by Angela ...\nAnd he was a member of the Winchester large I'm of the sons of Italy and it's something that actually was published during World War two and it's United we stand with the flag of the United states that was probably depicted ... all of the sheet music\nThe loyalty oath was an important feature\nBut the sons of Italy was something that really did incorporate a lot of ways not just to tally tally and Americans and associated friends\nBut it was something in some ways that made people feel a parts of the fabric of life\nOr their sons of Italy chapters or I should say lodges in the west they did an Italian as yet had west\nVery much so they're they're across the United states and in subways that something that you begin to realize that you know it's waned somewhat I mean just like other organizations that are fraternal lodges\nThere's that up and down but the idea is in some ways it's always maintained that aspect of contributions back to the greater society and in many ways when I read the sons of Italy um newsletter which we get on a monthly basis it's a wonderful newspaper\nI thought it was a staunch Bush did how much each of these individual lodges Jew so the newspaper goes into greater detail not only what scholarship funds especially in may and June with graduating high school or even college\nYou begin to realize that how important it was that education was something that made one it's some aspects\nThing can away that made you contribute back to whatever it was that you just send it from and then this way we're establishing a scholarship fund with the sons of Italy and hopefully it will actually benefit people in the future\nSo I think sometimes that is an important way to look at this organization I mean they would down to the nineteenth century that was the daughters of the American revolution the sons of the American revolution colonial war society\nThey all do things that a lot of ways that made certain groups of people who are members solve it\nCognizant of the fact of what they could do not only as a group to benefit themselves and then benefits the greater community but also to help assist everyone and I think that's what the sons of Italy is done it was the fraternal organization and in this way Italy\nIs the ... aspect of this month of course is a major feature of Italian Americans\nHave a few more minutes I just want to flesh out or when it's like in Italy both a little marching retire and Naples bay area where you kind of hang out you mentioned country you have to take a boat there do you take it from ... or or or Naples already taken\nFrom Naples I usually will drive down to Naples I leave the car at the hotel and we'll take the boat across it's about a forty minute ride absolutely wonderful of course you're going out to this\nYou know Ireland and who were bribed but it's a little honky tonk on the waterfront and the boats are all docked but then you take a the ... up to and I pray and had a ... is the most magical place on the face of the earth\nThe sun is beautiful the breeze your high on the air you see the panoramic views of the Mediterranean the food is incredible always usually seafood or fish\nBut in a lot of ways that was something that I really have enjoyed going back many times it's three as also off the coast\nBut I think it a lot of ways you realize that even in ancient times the ... was actually a destination but the wealthy from the rural area\nAnd it's something today that I realized what we bring back things that always seemed to have lemons Idaho islands and lemon cello lemon cello is wonderful\nBut the idea is limited and you know different things napkins is always ... said they absolutely gorgeous we sent back China from um ...\nAnd I think that is something that you begin to see that it's this whole aspect of society that a little bit slower than Boston of course I don't have to be at a place the meeting and I don't have to drive from here to there\nI can almost walk within the community and it's pleasant during the day of course all of Italy has tourism\nBut after five o'clock everything becomes ... and you begin to realize that people will have a drink before dinner and then dinner is usually two or three courses\nAnd then it's just the most wonderful aspect of course we're tourists but the whole aspect is that you begin to actually enjoy what it is about the Italian American culture\nCaters sixty seconds on on pay and how how it\nStruck you well pump pay was really one of the most wonderful things we waited a few times over the years\nBut a few years ago we took our niece and nephew for the twenty fifth wedding anniversary we arrived at palm pay and we got there and I was giving the history about palm pay ... pay was a community that was really self sufficient and a lot of ways but it was within eyesight of the soup is\nThat during the period of ... it was everything from the wealthy to the poor it had some of the best\nPlumbing and drainage beautiful ... does it had great architecture it was a wonderful\nAspect of community and see some of the buildings cleared away we're actually restaurants with uh places where bowls of food would be exactly like where you would go up ... it'd be like a food truck well not a food truck but a a place with an outer door window you can just walk up and buy this stuff\nBut they also have the boss and they'd have saw on us but they also have indoor court yet and it was something in a lot of ways that it's being excavated continually but I loved it because it's actually it was something that was almost preserved and volcanic stone in Seventy nine eight day\nWe were there at one time and of course I saw that don't really was the ... smoking but it was something that they have a wild dogs that actually rural area so it's quite fun\nWell listen we need to roll out of here thank you so much for coming by as you do each month to celebrate Italian American and talk a little bit about your book and about your trips to Italy and you're going back soon we are over the winter and same place same area\nSame hotel for 'em but we'll probably actually spend a little bit of time in southern Italy\nExcellent All right six one Seventy five or ten thirty I might after Anthony goes I'm loving talking

but it's not anywhere near as pleasant as an as pleasant and experience Venice\nIt's fairy tale but it's real\nIt's a it's tough to believe that some place can be that beautiful it almost hurts your heart\nIt's ... it's it's truly painfully beautiful it's so beautiful that it hurts you somehow I don't know if it's because it's it would be impossible to describe its beauty or because you have to leave it or because it's so beautiful compared to where you live there is a weird pang of\nSomething it's so beautiful\nAnd talked about arriving there and going through a place called ... and then

[noise]\nSkiing and you can do all the way to the top you get a ticket or once you get up to the top of the ... you get off what a bus or whatever you call would pick the food or the cable car only halfway up the top [noise]\nAnd then after that they have this [noise] I watch this I mean that that uh they drive up the on the top of the lava and there you go further up and they want to go to the top\n[noise] uh sometimes have a guy with the case that you can go up to ... and as you drive up to the mound that are on the road from a nickel or see all the way up to a mountain on the road juicy\nIt's a couple of houses have been there were buried years ago by the law but what about\nThe run up to and it's something to see a beautiful and and uh all the little town at the time [noise] people from the city\nShrunk down there they drive up their their their their ... buses that they go up the skiing for\nIn the morning up until about two or three o'clock and then all those buses you see them coming out and they stop on the little towns they stop at the bottom of the cafe and eating their start drinking they start dancing or something\nI I live here I was born there and uh I Know what it is a left the country when I was Fifteen\nWho knows how to throw a spectacular party\nOh my God I went to a party and its house in the summer so great is that with those are ... cocktails I told you about\nKing crab legs is the big ones right I'm guessing we've named king you know\nBoxes of king crab legs there was no wondering if you could have another one that there was an

in your mouth to be cliche\nAnd oh fried clams trays of fried clams big trays of fried clams you could just be within a you know they just pick them up and handfuls and smash them in their mouth it was it was fantastic\nI Would think since he's and he's very very big expert on Italian cooking you know it maybe you'd want to go to one of these cooking to us\nBut it's it's a bird person devil occupancy I wouldn't want my own room because I Know I was ...\nI don't want to be keeping people up yeah I Do is you know I kind of think everyone's notice though because have you ever been\nCamping where there are multiple bunk beds the Appalachian\nTrail the the AMC hats sometimes you'll have six people sitting in one of those\nYou'll have girls guys that they're you know unisex anybody can

Italian because we're going to the north end Boston's north end a national treasure and as Bob in the north and Bob\nYou're on a rally hey I Would be remiss if I didn't call you call that I think your caller and shouting and that so what would it be if you're calling from the LA Times that's right [laughter] what did you land in the journal of the travel talk I Love you know everybody loves you travel talk you know a great job describing things very descriptive\nAnd a couple of other people did you the the woman who from Boston she runs a business over there\nI hear that I even went and checked up website so interested in that I mean I haven't been over there since I was a teenager but they got me thinking about going back you know all the talk you know just you know visual in my mind you know I didn't appreciate it when I was younger I went with my grandfather actually wants to Sicily and I didn't appreciate it when I was younger and you know maybe it's time for me to go visit\nThat cooking vacations swims down really good I don't know how much it is is\nThat it's a great look inside I just I just checked real quick what I was listening to try to a lot of good multi task is a kind of focusing on the radio and I was just checking it out but I'll go back to tomorrow we'll check it out a little more [noise]\nSee what I mentioned to you you didn't appreciate when you're a kid where would you go back to [noise]\nUm well I mean the trickle Terry area describing sounds really nice or a you know you're gonna be a lot of good created a lot of friends of mine you know the market coast that area\nYou know that's that's that's that's probably as places where I Would go you know\nYeah yeah like I said I was a kid I Know what was it was there was an ... dumped especially what'd you want to visit relatives are stopped it was a little village type town and like you said there wasn't really much to do it wasn't you know when you're young kid you just want to go home you know so you don't appreciate the beauty of things [laughter] like that when you're younger so I just wanted to go home [laughter] we just got to get my grandfather was dragged along\nWell now with the mother country\nSo you recommended that restaurant last say last ... last year you liked it I liked it allegedly\nThe oh good I'm Glad you liked it and how did you ever get to talk to lean on the honor their no very nice lady\nAnd only been one time I got to go back but a previous maybe general homeland you Frank talked about rice balls is that a thing you know yeah yeah\nOh yeah oh yeah I didn't see any it's called which means that the orange and Italian I didn't even to orange yeah I mean Cheney's oranges plural\nSo that's it 'cause it looks like an orange if you look at it like they put the word comes around it as an orange look towards what looks like an orange but it's basically a rice ball in a yeah you mentioned a bird does which is yeah one of the best ones you can get in Boston um you know I'm biased I mean that's my favorite place was happy that they mentioned that 'cause she has a pretty accurate for the best starting changing yet\nSo there's rice ball but what's in is this something inside the rise\nYeah well the one that they have they're the ones with the little beef hamburgers beef in a piece for like a little bit of sauce and uh yeah they have other ones will like spinach and cheese but this one has like cheese and a meat in a row and peace inside\nIt's very good very good in the price of very long Broncos is like we're we're a little a little holes in a while I don't know if you've been there like you said it's right across from Mike's but for only open until like about maybe two or three o'clock in the afternoon really broke leisurely yeah drove they open up about you know ten thirty eleven actually the\nWho runs the place you're going in the early in the morning like if I go on for a walk in and they're like five six o'clock in the long ago and then getting everything ready and you know it's everything ready and then he opens up you know when the\nTen thirty eleven like I said usually aligned goes up so you got to have to get there real early of the weather is really nice aligned goes up so quick and it's by the line was the law was along the lines of scare you just wait in line is probably will to learn about Fifteen minutes if there's a long line open door usually yeah wow\nThat that's one of the the price of the right you know you can get beer and wine there and it's a very reason I like I said it would be the the local people that have been her wildly keeps things reason was a lot like close to you know leaders like local grocery this case the prices reasonable about some of the bishops to come in and like on the street can be a big tourist state because they know they got\nBigger and to me so the prices can be a little out of whack you know\nBut uh yeah the point where last he has a very reasonable number of those is very nice you know they make us a pizza there would you like the square pizza\nYeah it's a it's a piece of they're considered there too and also if you're a reasonable\nHave you ever experimented with meat balls putting and we're like tonight we heard about me bows did including raisins and paying your only nuts\nYeah I'm just I Would have to buy on Carson's my grandfather my grandfather had the best me all the men were all the cooking challenge\nYeah my grandfather me there are so it was also quite was almost like a hamburger number like a ball
