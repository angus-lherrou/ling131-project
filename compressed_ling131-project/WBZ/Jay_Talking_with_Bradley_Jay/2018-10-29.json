is you always live below your means you don't blow the budget on things that are unnecessary and illegal immigrants illegal migration illegal invasion is on necessary\nAnd I go to you we have Joe in mail is hello Joe you're on the air\nGrieving worries affairs tiger Michael welcome to you know [noise]\n... legal immigrants to do our jobs is I'm born out of a generation of generation of entitlement classes coming out of our educational system I'm costs kids coming out of our schools don't want to do the grunt work\nRight they've been taught to ... to ... work ... they're trying to sacrifice I've read things should be handed to them and we're class of Democrats out there promising them [laughter] you goodies\nRight Joe like they're too good when I was sixteen I was watching uh I was a cook at Pizza Hut and part of my job was to clean the bathrooms both men's and women's ... at the end of the night I clean all the pants and they even give me a pair of gloves\n[laughter] Murray's work [laughter] when I was twelve years old I was cutting grass for fifty cents an hour there you go you know it's ... it's crazy\nAnd you know if we could just still a work ethic back into our younger kids ... you know we have the manpower need of\nCourse you know it doesn't take much sport illegal immigrants working our country a lot of them look up on the rules all of them are doing all of them work yes for me the\nContractors want to pay them under the minimum wage and under the table and so they don't have to pay a payroll tax and it's just a giant sucking drain on the economic power of our country Joe\n... and ... in our kids ... you know we're going to order tore a Porsche where we're not going to have\nEnough people to to work that war war boom one other point I wanted to make ... you know do we illegal immigrants they rarely in this country to get their benefits right in front of our ... ... um\nUm they wore a driver's licenses right or want to be able to vote\nRight I mean I Do not want to be governed by an illegal everywhere now I just don't want it out of work but in my tracks is to um a form of government is run by a legal sorry excuse me I'm an American I Want to be governed by Americans\nA trend that is apps that is a pretty straightforward requirement Joe and most of many people feel that way it is atrocious to think yes that it may be people out there don't know that you're referring to San Francisco is actually\nLooking to let 'em illegal aliens vote in school board elections which is just preposterous right it's like Joe\nWe okay for the ... the Supreme Court rule is that if if a kid is here legally that we have to\nEducate them right okay so now these kids are in school and we're paying our tax dollars for them to get educated but that's not enough Joe right when they their kids these kids are illegal and they're getting an education for free on taxpayer dime but that's not enough so that now they want to have now they want to have parents of\nThese kids be able to vote and election\nYou know what it costs are educated the kids in school you know we're ... return Fifteen I Know there are some dollars a year per child\nRape and then they say like oh well some of these kids they some of these illegal aliens their kids are citizens yeah okay so what what's your point there still illegal they cannot vote because you know what happens next Joe today to a school board in San Francisco tomorrow it city council in New York City then it's state by state right this encroachment\nStay we're just we're just [laughter] you know they really pay taxes I don't consider paying six and a half cents on a hamburger attacks well\nYeah they neither do I do but they said people they dismissed this can ARD that they pay that they have a dummy Social Security number and their pain payroll tax like that is a it does happen but it is so infant test and Lee small it's a joke most people work under the table and we all know that\nWe're living housing and they're out there competing were people that are paying the bills are paying the health and welfare the pay and I'm I'm the right amount of taxes to pay and Social Security checks and they don't have\nA southern dependence so that they show that the taxes they pay a minimum to begin with\nRight we're just being it's being stuff down our throats Joe and this is why I wrote the op ed that I wrote and actually my next one I'm going to have some more I'd have to solutions and this one you know it's pretty simple National Guard at the border and shut down the border in Mexico feel that pain\nHas to be with for some type of force [laughter] I mean sure the say but\nYou know I mean no it's we don't it doesn't have to be you know nothing lead let's be clear nothing lethal it's very simple National Guard stop them and then shut down the border Mexico is going to have to feel the pain of not help doing a better job of turning these people away and we're not going to let any of them come in legally until they help us\nAt ... wasn't too long ago they were using rubber bullets wrong [noise]\nNo I don't want to watch I don't want to talk about that I don't want to talk about I don't know I don't want to control on a grow I don't want to give that air time we can do things we are the civilized people not the barbarians but the other long term solution that is non lethal for sure\nIs a wall they'll the wall\nWell I I like to see what they do ... just on the\nBorder okay Joe don't make my job harder I don't know much Murray we have to go\nWith what I'm ... plan a pier and be cleared see because obviously players\nAstronaut well now no National Guard orderly turning away and shutting down the border for a ... amount of time to make people see that we're serious and we're not going to take the sitting down\nAre going to the new well that's I agree wholeheartedly to Mussa ... excellent thank you Joe have occurred you're okay but by okay everybody\nSo I'm just going to leave you with and going to leave you with this thought\nUm that is my two step plan\nBuild the wall support them all who are portable and like I said the wall is the most lethal way and non lethal pardon me the wall is the most non lethal way we have of keeping order at the border it will save lives on both sides because\nWe have to be cognizant of the lives of the border patrol um and do even though people are invading us we\nAre better than they are and we don't want harm to come to them we just simply want to turn them away and they need to go back to their country and if they find a legal way to apply that's fine but oh well it's\nThe best way the best way to stop this complete an\nHonor ridiculous nonsense happening over and over again and the last on I'm going to leave you with is how fraudulent asylum is and they're not even hiding it anymore the immigration American immigration Lawyers Association association rooted an email that\nThey um the practice of affirmatively affirmatively filing an application for asylum with the end goal of applying for cancellation of remove all has\nBecome a widespread practice\nLet me translate that for you you get cancellation remove all if you're married to a U.S citizen so what these lawyers do is they file\nA bogus skeleton asylum claim knowing it will get denied knowing that the person will end up in deportation court and then they will apply for the relief of cancellation of remove all\nThat's the trick I'm telling you the inside information keep your ears perked I Will

I think you and I have talked about this example before you are familiar just generally would poke him on characters correct ...\nAnd I cannot think of her name and it's not important to this conversation but the woman that does secret you mhm most popular character of all the gotta catch 'em all characters\nShe can only say her name he could you\nHow much she goes to the entire gamut of range of curiosity I'm not I'm not even going to attempt to say\nYou got you yeah I did it but\nYet or anger yeah or happiness or complete be funneled meant\nYes mhm and I'm thinking to myself this person deserves an Emmy [laughter] yeah with the\nHer name is her name is ... Kuwait autonomy\nOkay yeah and that raises really we've talked about her\nYeah yeah she's amazing and cheat so shy on camera it's kinda funny [laughter] she's she's like the most beloved carry she's the most beloved voice in the entire poke him on universe\nAnd have you met her I have not that not\nBecause I Love ... I Need to go to Japan again [laughter] well\nIf you ever do meter just give her a compliment from some unknown radio guy in Boston that she is totally under rated G. needs to get recognition for what she does and convince the\n... take a look at the second line and just read the words that are on their don't worry about acting just say them out loud to that the audience can hear what's going on with this line\nI Will never stop not until the day we returned to warrior and save our people\nOkay so let's take a look at who are are with red leaf is\nRight so he is if you can see if you see on the first page it gives you an overview of who he is you know I read all\nRight so he's a young man they describing this fiery and passionate and he's defending his clean and that's part of the deal they are beleaguered people apparently I Will never stop until the day we were turn to our ... and save our people All right so that's really all you need to know\nRight I have a question yeah\nIs a story of the same ... flash Gordon\n[laughter] probably not okay our our data or just start maybe could be okay I don't know\nYou know the the thing is that that's where they need to return to parent though\nWith an audition script that's really all you need to know if you were late to our border yet from flash Gordon than by all means you use that as your frame of reference sure it's your reference has to inform this line so we've got I don't ever stop exclamation point\nNot until the day we returned to our ... and save our people exclamation point now one of the things that candy Milo says\nAnd she's a famous actress a who's done a ... you know a thousand cartoons one of the things she says with an audition is you can\nDisrespect the punctuation okay\nSo don't worry about the punctuation necessarily it's not the only arbiter of how you see this line\nThey're trying to show you that he's passionate we've got exclamation points around most of what he says in this audition so [noise] you know what is the point is we want to say this line I Will never stop [noise]\nNot until the day we returned to our ... and save our people okay so part of what you need to do in an audition Morgan is figure out I Will never stop I'll never stop what what does he responding to they don't give you context All right\nOkay so so let's let's play an imagination game who's just said something to him\nThat makes him respond like this and so you have to think of what was just said to me what just happened that made this line come out from me\nSo he says I Will never stop someone had said to him or you have to stop this nonsense start behaving\nThe way I Want you to\nYeah like the court here you are you know stop behaving like a warrior and behave more like course here you need to stop this war like behavior so someone who's just scolded him\nOkay meet up to them like they're\nNot at all\n[noise] so how would you if if you were looking\nTo defend yourself against the school day I'm going to give you would've called action words I'm going to give you something that we call in a theater we called them objected okay or and and in in general ... voice acting we tend to call them actions okay so I Am looking asking you to defend\nYou've just been scolded still read this line to defend yourself OK and go\n\nI Will never stop not until the day we will turn Tora Bora and save our people do you want to stay\nIn that okay I thought I told\nHim that's fine I'm OK let's do this again do not underline the word we okay 'cause we can do that you can if you want to put a heart around our boreal you may because that's the that's the goal [noise] now what I Want you to think of to not just defend\nBut I Want you to incite I think that what does that mean to you to incite\nI'm going to take a stick and poke into the lion's cage\nWhere you go and so begin with I Will never stop and go\nI Will never stop not until the day we returned to ... and save our people\nOkay so your seat you can really tell how different your energy was an ad yes\nVery different now I Want you to think of how you're actually delivering these lines and I want you to to think of being able to be a little more fluid with the musicality of this so let's move on to another line Let's hook line for\nI was looking for that when you ...\nSo let's look at wind for it's a nice life says\nTo just read the line from ... from forming content\nI don't like doing this but this is war they may have started it but I went to finish it\nOkay now so the the in the general uh urgency for this line would be if you looked at this and you did it with the with the first passion that came to mind you would think it was ... or sad or animal like okay you would think that\nSo given that to me in a in a I'm In a in a manner to complain\nOkay to ... to lament\nI think I can do that yeah All right\n\nI don't like doing this\nBut this is war they may have started it\nI'm going to finish it\nOkay so that the that the tire guy seem a lot of action now let's change this up a little bit okay I Want you to dismiss the person you're speaking to the person that you're speaking to had said something you ... do I am disregarding here\nHe said something he the person who has spoken to you\nHad said something about how ... the it is to take up your weapons and kill your enemies\nOkay and what our wick is saying is that's not why I'm doing this so what I Want you to do is dismiss the person that you're speaking to be a little\nOkay and then you have to be the last time because we're going to hell bent on top of the hour\nI Know so be quick about the delivery of the line and dismissed the spokes person you're speaking to be dismissive\nDon't like doing this but this is war they may have started it but I think to finish it\nWas completely different and that's what we ask view when we do casting\nI'm going to keep these lines and keep practicing [laughter] one of these days I'll be in front of you and the way around a table and other people and I'm going to do the best to his press\nAnd I'm sure you will be magnificent\nThe beef thank you for coming on and it was a political I haven't had\nOne in a couple of years and of course I pick the night the red Sox become world champions to do this yeah bad turning on our part but that's OK\nOkay but we had fun and there

Jones and [noise]\nYou know when George George Scott Rico better Sally and red Smith I'm very jealous that back\nOn a new Reggie Smith [noise] um but I don't remember memory is such an interesting thing to make [noise] and I took a few pictures which I still have from that game you know I'd probably on\nThe ... and I have the scorecard of a gentleman you'll probably know this who played right field for the cardinals in Nineteen sixty seven\nBillion Williams nope nope and I have no memory of seeing him play but I kept a scorecard [laughter] you know I mean everything he did it back that day and have no memory of seeing him but I Know\nI Am I gave you Billy Williams because he was a curb Roger Maris yes\nThat's exactly right right and in retrospect having no memory of actually watching Roger Maris play at that game I'm kinda thrilled that I watch can play even though I Can't remember it chill it's very strange\nOr if I'm not mistaken Roger marris\nWas from Missouri I think that's right and didn't he he ended up I think he was released he stayed in Missouri after he was with the car does I think he got a a a a a dealership from or was it ... Bush I'm not sure\nI went to work for them um but he was just a tremendous ballplayer and you know that that achievement in Nineteen sixty one I think is one of the you know the great achievements in in in the history of sports and the pressure that he was under\nIn Nineteen sixty one but I just find it funny that I you know kept a scorecard for the whole game and to this day have no memory of of watching him play that game but it was you know very exciting to be there [noise]\n[noise] so have the steak off I'm Sorry to hear that no worry about it well hope\nHopefully folks will call it a chick from seven to five or ten thirty or a or a one eight eight let me see eight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty\nYou do that very well you think you've been a gift for\n[laughter] [laughter] and you can call in and talk with Morgan about uh the great victory today or the world series pastor you could talk about Nineteen sixty seven like Donna did um ... your favorite player of all time if I'm not mistaken\nTony ... was the great Tony can ugly arrow yeah he was just tremendous\nAnd then more cameras and microphones and Tony sees\nTo North shore bar mhm and obviously there were people there and joined the game and every now and then they would they would throw it\nTo the location just to get actual wealthy so yeah of people eating and drinking you enjoy watching the Arabs are\nYou know I still think of all the players from you know I mean decades ago [noise] um well I guess you know as at certain ages you know when I was you know most obsessed with baseball and and you know was following it all the time I mean I think people like you know Dick rabbits oh my heavens\nThis this imposing incredible figure\nAnd they let him go and sixty six was his last year\nI forget where he went to Detroit oh he went to Detroit okay\nCan you imagine had they kept him to sixty seven\n[laughter] no I Can't I mean it it seems I don't quite understand why they would have let him go but uh uh he was such a tremendous pitcher\nJessie weren't the monster was it not that was his nickname\nYeah and I think of ... ruled Wilson and you know a a un Donna is that the previous caller mentioned Jose ... and the the the famous play from Nineteen sixty seven dollars an hour it in Chicago in Chicago\nI forget the runner who was a third can something term Barry can bury and that's just one of the most exciting place I've ever seen in my life yeah\n... really pulled that off I think one of the announcer he's got a weak arm here comes the throat of the plate\nAnd we know how would jump really high cart and slept with her daughter\nSlap the tag down it was the one of the most exciting place I've ever seen I think at that in one of the Boston papers at the time if I'm remembering this

I don't think they'll ever to build something with an all star something years is good player and nobody could come in and feel the ball bear head and and get it over the first like a bunker or slow Lola\nHe was good at that it's terrific that tries to think of every inning late innings when he did it for a pretty good average most of the time but it would always be a pop up when he needed to win the game but do you remember that Frank you always hope because he knew he had some power but also he could he could hit well for average but it was pop out oh\nYeah I ... what kind of idea isn't this edition very aren't they just what a keen should be\nAnd that's the ... are just lazy\nYup and I'm thinking as I'm waiting on the phone to talk to you guys when you think of the Boston teams on TALK of the all the Celtics the bird error Celtics and even wanna later and when you're thinking of\nThe red Sox for this year and other years and when you're thinking of ... or the other and see what the ... of course the Bruins I guess\nThey're a team they there are some years there really a team oriented thing\nAs the result six and and and the patriots of course our team all the way where all the way a team\nOf ballot checks got them being a team [noise] just says is in court amazing you don't even realize how amazing it is to do it with all those different kinds of guys are all good but to get them all to\nBuy into a team even for one year\nAnd that the whole thing about Boston in at least my life in history as\nIt's mainly a team thing and it really is you know a team will team play it all the sports\nOvershadows overshadows the the tremendous individual stars although we've had a number of stars but it overshadows world that it gets something special going even I mean he conceded baseball\nAnd you can see it in basketball but you don't really you don't really think of it too much in football I mean ... realize of course but I or my random parts\nNice to see it good good team that just came back for the call Bye bye Bye bye and Julia week let's go to Steven Steven\nCard Oregon Hi Andrew static back in the day my dad was an avid Red Sox fan and in those days they would have family night stand\nWay so they would have ... that my dad would get a reserve grandstand faith for two fifty\nAnd I would sit next to him for fifty cents and it was absolutely incredible\nWhat years are we talking about here well we have to be talk at work I'm Seventy\nFour now so we have to be a while that was probably add to be in the late fifties if I Would say maybe early early sixties I remember ... ... ... miles long and Germany would it be playing catch what\nEverybody out in the in the seats are way out in the field I I think it was correct I think in the past ...\nAnd the grants am and uh it was amazing and they would do that about\nTwo times a year and um they would START I think it was like five thirty six o'clock and it would go on to ... to ... midnight the two games for the same\nPrice and uh those days are gone they never they never read or write or call the ... farm but if I had a twilight or a double that are a few guys to\nPeople at Dodgers stadium the other day they got to see to gain all\nWe did [laughter] at abs absolutely and I sat right through there till about three thirty I watched it and uh there was a it was really amazing and they uh they did quite well a fantastic so I'm looking forward to the parade on Wednesday\nAttached to hear your story about to go to the family night the family to the game that's really great\nI just wanted to share that with you guys both things are nice they buy stock or to make you buy buy\nBill I'm yeah ask Andrew I'm to condense is a little but that's how we met he wrote a book about his mother's singing career and Andrew tell people all about to ban it\nWell just very quickly 'cause I obviously want to get back to you know you're just a wonderful guy but a ... some in the Boston area might ... remember my mom as a team to personality or in part on W. busy in the Nineteen fifties and\nShe did voice overs for decades in Boston and a number of\nYears working as a singing in the Boston area but\nAh the book is primarily about her years as a network TV performer by a on NBC primarily from Nineteen forty nine to Nineteen fifty two\nSinging on K Kaiser's television show on NBC and your head parade on NBC\nAnd so that's primarily what the book is about the New York years but then my folks came to Boston in Nineteen fifty three and she sang on her own show and easy for a couple of people in Nineteen fifty five [noise] and it had a wonderful career in Boston first encounter these\nActually learning different things like that that opportunity no we're we're getting off the bat\nI'm I I don't hear any feedback I'm I'm home in Brooklyn\nI ...
