I just wanted to call it a ... where we're from Massachusetts and Massachusetts has probably one of the best um uh it's\nOne of the best states to put solar and and the reason I'm telling you the others so people and then it probably is um you know um\nCommunity will know that a Massachusetts just um they just added I think sixteen how they have twenty two hundred megawatts of installed solar in the state right now\nAnd they judged okay to another sixteen hundred under what's called the smart plan\nWhich have you know there's a good subsidy to help people install it until their houses I Believe that depending on where you install it it's it's a three to five year payback most most productive should beat around three to four years so that's a good so in ...\nThe average a solar installation rooftop solar installation in America in seven years but in places where they have things that I was four years three years as you\nSay right right and these New Hampshire has some pretty good incentives also it was an important that you know between what you're saying and what I'm trying to get out there as it is do it and do it now I mean\nThat was the other thing they said it was last forever you know they're designed to attract attention to to the technology but they won't last forever so why do you ...\nYou know John Kerry ... John Kerry once said to me right that um if we incentivize that this was ... you know maybe ten years ago if we incentivize\nRenewable energies in it that that that the the oil industry is are all done and and and if we if we don't do it\nThat's going to show that we're not leaving the country in the right direction and he was so right and we are going in that direction and even though we have an aunt are renewable energy president he's really he's he's really almost like a mouse talking through an elephant he can't do anything\nWell the analogy I is when I think about the economy and uh what direction that may or may not go in and it's I think of the information age and what the California ...

I don't know why they have to make them look so bad to make no\nSense actually make money on the cars that to the company that limits just money and that's because they keep\nDoing one time things like being their profit line okay so they now they haven't recently started to make money however the fact that say our our intent to I'm not going under and they have not released a thirty eight\nThousand dollars model three that they keep promising there instead selling the souped up version with high performance features that they can sell for six states so we're going to have to wait for that thirty thousand mine and batteries continued to come down Tesla than a hundred\nBucks per kilowatt compared to GM which is still around a hundred and fifty and don't expect to get down there to to for until ...\nTwenty Twenty one but the irony is uh\nThe and say gee I'm Paul ... is one of the best cars on the market and they haven't done much advertising\nBecause I think there are a little nervous about traveling up and you're right they're losing some money on it\nUh they ... and I think it's just a question of experience and it's also a question of scale because the Tesla Factory as massive they've got a battery partnering Panasonic they've been studying this stuff\nFor Fifteen Years and they're putting solar panels all over the roof of that huge factory down there in Nevada so they're there and they've got robots most of the factories robots so they're going to be profitable they already are profitable on the vehicles but not on the company says I Am\nOn a per vehicle basis they can already ... make a small profit\nBill are you a fan of the model s Tesla model X or the roads there\n[noise] um I I'm not sure if the models but I like the sport he sat down and whatnot and I'm not sure what model that is\nI think it's the s that says it as a ... mile range of three hundred and thirty five miles zero you know the ones that\nReally fast Scottsdale like a soap opera\nRoaster though are you know top speed I don't know if this is true maybe Bruce can verify this top speed up two hundred and fifty miles per hour\nI I I'm not going to try to verify that\nA ... mile range of six hundred and twenty miles is that a car that actually exists or is this a dream\nI don't know but I Do know that they had they are much faster off the line and an internal combustion engine car and are they now they they're creating separate categories because the gas cars don't want to compete with the electric right\nMy only concern is this all these batteries and solar panels I from what I understand solar panels have a twenty year life so we get all this\nPollution from Matt in the ... to get the ... build these batteries and the solar parents you need or metals and from what I understand that Chinese on a lot of these mice around the world and literally point asset to suffer raise\nAll over the ground separate these minerals from wherever they are deposited so any at just but ... says that's clean\nBut in a lot of infringement of tourists to get is rare earth minerals to build solar panels to build batteries ... ... ... and going on and most of them\nFor years you're gonna have solid state batteries for all of their cars and they will not be using that were metals are also\nThey um [noise] well I forgot what your previous caller solar panels themselves by what the mythology created by the oil companies there live as a solar panel foot\nPrint the footprint to manufacture a solar panel is tiny compared a and it it it has been slowly dispelled and that's why I have the links to uh you know a very knowledgeable properly prepared a piece on why that as a pile up there it was invented by\nBill before you go on a question for you guys are these cars you don't have high performance but they don't have any sound is that not a factor for a car guy you wanted to go from room a little bit we we we are to have it\nBut the the the the fact that has no lack I mean that's that's that's wild and those are the company in Texas that builds mustangs all electric and yeah they're just insanely fast soldiers literally the costs will get to the seats\nThat cost I don't know and it doesn't have all of a [laughter]\nYou know bill thank you very much appreciate that are really good cause the night I got a lot of you generated a lot of interest speaking of

by ...\nNow\nWe're going to get some news and then when I hear from Micah in Maine my main man who is\nGoing to talk about why squirrels shouldn't be\nComfort animals on planes and first I thought well why not you know if you like your dog why can't you like a squirrel I think you really can and maybe but I Know that you will say that it's a liberal thing to think a squirrel could be a covered animal but I think what you may I Do however\nSympathize with the ... not one squirrels on an airplane I think there may be a very good reason why they don't want squirrels on a plane to become for animals big scene woman preyed the big scene probably shouldn't have\nBut I Want to find out why for sure and we talked about um last night I think we actually got um some subscribers for his podcast air plane geeks we'll talk to I think he's going to give us in just a bit W.

C. news radio ten thirty\nFor marrying works to prevent genocide you need to talk about how you're feeling if you're grieving civil not\nThe one time you're learning how to how about anything you can find support for ... or feeling ... anything and now my call or text and married him skate by how blind twenty four seven of having having\nCutting around forty six Seventy three to ...\nLearn what you mean the camp thirty dot com slash ...\nW E Z bus WXXI ... two men and I aren't radio station\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never so [noise]\nGood morning I'm doing great and I got to tell your last guest I just found an electrified\nA very good I got a real real charge at a bank you thank you [laughter]\nSo uh what do you know about ... animals on airplanes and why maybe a squirrels not welcome\n[laughter] well you know there's a difference between an emotional support or comfort animal at a service animal and that's even defined by a by the transportation dot Gov\nAnd one of the things that people may not be aware of overall is that the ADA the Americans with Disabilities Act\nIs not something that the airlines have to deal with when it comes to passengers they do with employees but passengers are covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act\nThey're covered by the air carrier access act which is a completely different set of rules [noise] I'm not a very similar to ADA but they're very very but there there are some differences in it one of the things that the air air carrier access access some very specifically\nIs it airlines are never required to accept snakes\nReptiles ferrets rodents sugar gliders and spiders and it's a very very clear that the uh the person that was involved in this may have said she was bringing her emotional support animal with her but didn't say what kind of emotional support animals she was going to be bringing with her\nRight so why would they exclude squirrels I mean if you have a dog on dogs can be bigger than squirrels seems like a squirrel is a pretty on obtrusive animal\nThey definitely are there's no doubt about that and squirrels and certainly a miniature horses are much larger but if a rodent gets on board an aircraft or gets loose on an aircraft and I've heard stories about it from pilots who had this happen to them from captains you can't fly the plane if a mouse a spot it on an aircraft\nYou have to ... passengers and then hopefully it has to be searched\nUntil the mouse gets off you've heard about mice and rats and squirrels chewing through wiring on\nOn getting cars if they get on an aircraft are going to chew through the wiring there and that can be even more dangerous if you're in the middle of the year\nAnd if they find a mouse infestation they find a mouse or rodents inside the pressure vessel of an aircraft often times what they have to do is pull that into the hangar\nFill that hole pressure vessel with nitrogen until the ... they all suffocate and the and the eighty animals die because you can't be fine with an aircraft it's filled with mice just because they could be chewing through the wires based on their teeth\nYou know I never thought about my skin on plans but I guess they do right and I are very much run onto the tire American climb up the landing gear\nThey get everywhere you know that's one of the problems but I'm not an expert on my so I'm not an expert on wrote and said I'm certainly not an expert on the air carriers act but yeah\nBut I've been all sorts of animals can get on an aircraft and in certain areas they uh they they spray aircraft with insecticide before uh before they leave to make sure that you know insects are transferred from you know carry from one\nPart of a world to another uh but yeah if I might get a that's a mouse gets on a plane and I'm also spotted and uh you know the guy that has pointed out the cabin crew that planes not going to take off\nHave you ever had that happened to you I have not had that happen and it's seen out of it happening\nI have heard of an account of it happening by a captain that I Know that flies for a major airline that he's had happened and\nSo what happens if they don't find the mouse and does it just got to get another airplane they cancelled the flight that\nYeah that's exactly what happens to be the the flight is canceled they they don't fly that aircraft until the the mouse is found or that they know that they've done everything they can do\nTo eliminate it by you know can you imagine pulling the the plane out of service closing up the cabinet filling it up with nitrogen and how long it has to be it takes a very long time but it could be out of service for a few days\nThat's why it's good to fly an airline to major airline and they have more than one plane wherever you're going to be sometimes something does go wrong and there's no replacement plane easily available\nThen used us stuck that happened to me it took some half baked their line from LA home and there was an oil leak and they just had to cancel it because they had no other plane\nYeah sometimes that happens and the majors usually have aircraft in reserve and I\nHave friends that are dispatcher for a major airline and work with him once when a an aircraft was flying from Chicago to Paris and it was I'd take it back it was from the Denver to Paris it was someplace over Chicago when a couple of ... labs went out\nAnd they were trying to figure out what they were going to do because they knew they could not go on to Paris with it they ended up a landing it in a in Boston and they happen to have another aircraft there that was not going to go off to the next day\nThey switch to pastors over to that and um and they kept the the airplane with a bad laboratories there until the Adam fixed and it went out the next morning but you know there are certain they always have to have something ready to go just in case that's what dispatchers do\nAll right my ...

you'd like to ask any question make a comment to act of Mica who's an airplane deep please do six one Seventy five or ten thirty America has a is involved with the podcast\nAirplane geeks what are you working on these days on the ... my\nWell it's really interesting that this week's podcast happened to be about electric aircraft propulsion a based on the guest you had in the first hour\nAnd how they're working on a new motor we had a guest on Roy ... who works with a company called ... that she was working on a special electric motors that are designed for aircraft and uh we think this is going to revolutionize air travel in the\nIn the in the short distance area and the areas of two hundred three hundred miles because it's going to be much much less expensive and and be able to get a lot more aircraft in the air or has been for a lot less money 'cause you're not paying for fuel as as you are when you're\nUsing regular gasoline or turban engines\nAnd we'll ask the question that might be a rhetorical question because you might not have an answer but it seems to me that my ... need to you might be able to augment the electricity the electrical energy with solar panels on a plane because it's so high above so much of the atmosphere you must get a lot of solar energy into panels\nYou do get some but apparently from what I understand that I'm not an expert on this at all either but\nThat the density is not quite as high and the augmentation might come from a hybrid situation where you know you have a turban engine powering a a a generator to create power give electricity to the motor like you do an eyebrow vehicle\nAnd you could put in the arts and crafts I Do have some electric aircraft that are working with solar panels but it's just not enough to really keep it going for a big ... power aircraft\nI Wonder if I were just you Asian would make it more safe because if one system broke broke down the other one in\n[noise] I'm not sure that it would necessarily work that way you think of like diesel electric uh engines which you know we've had and and you're using in our submarines all the time and are used on a on a railroad or in a railroad industry\nThe diesel drives or the turbine drives the generator and it's you know ... which is providing electricity the electric motives I think it's pretty much the same that way in most situations like that\nAbout whether or not the squirrels should have been on the plane but I Want to ask you\nIf you think a squirrel could be a legit comfort animal or a legit service animal comfort animal look at something that people would beat DSD and other phobias and such good actually legitimately claim helps them\nI'm going to actually say yes I don't see it if you could do that with the dog or I don't see why couldn't do it was pretty much any animal\nTurtle I don't know about a small horse I mean yeah of course you could receive comfort from a small horse but certainly should not go on an airplane I don't think where where were the when you put a small horse\nComfort animal I kinda think that's legit I can see myself being covered by my pals squirrel take me take\nWhy don't know what the school's name would be but it takes quarterly squirrels and with me wherever I go I can see it but just like a two hour WB\nCain aftermath CBS News correspondent Nicky but teased in Bristol,

cosmologist you talked about light and how we have too much light and how it's screwing up nature ambient light street lights everywhere when you look at the\nWhen you look at the the country from space it's lit up at night I'll let you see is wasted anything you can see for space is absolutely wasted\nAnd it's it's doing a number on a lot of things that we don't really think about that he's actually working on a no light\nDark reservation in Maine there are three spots remaining their dark and the United states\nNevada\nBut Nevada wilderness well how does it still dark and the main way up in Maine and says what they're trying to do is\nGet communities to agree to be smart about lighting and not have that get ruined by light pollution too I suppose\nConservatives will say the late ... light pollution that some kind of everything but\nIt was like pollination are off a lot and tests show that it's due to excessive lighting like too much late at night it's just like I guess the

observatory is a builder of telescopes there's a company called Galileo scope and they build I think the two hundred and fifty thousand low cost high quality micro or sell the scopes excuse me telescopes\nSo that they can be accessible to people throughout the world and are by the way they're looking for more funding for anybody who's got three hundred and fifty K.\nBut he's got a an observatory and he built his own telescope in the observatory it's a ten inch wide ... a telescope that's big\nFor you know\nThat's pretty big for somebody's house I guess in the observatory with roof it rolls rolls off and it's pretty dark up and\nUp in that area not real dark but it's darker than it is in Boston and even in Boston when you set up a telescope you can see amazing things I'm hoping have my mind loan if in fact\nI Do if he says it's OK to visit him I think of them next weekend that'd be a good excuse to drive up there right\nHang out I think the wife six one Seventy five or ten thirty open lines now open ... let me just give me the details of this emotional support squirrels you think that's ridiculous or not\n[noise] I mean the one hand it's easy to say yeah that's ridiculous only dogs and cats and make you feel better but\nProbably not probably grow could make you feel better\nAnyway so\nPeople take all kinds of animals or they try to take all kinds of animals on planes but either way they're trying to take turkeys\nHey come for turkey I tried to make that happens and I said no so here's the deal with this woman tried to get on a frontier flight with her squirrel she did note on a ticket she did have a convert animal did not ... we're not that it was a squirrel\nWhat did you expect\nShe did give it to the TSA I don't know how that happened\nShe border to Cleveland bound frontier airlines flight toting a cage that'd be furry occupant made it through the x-ray machine I don't know how the that is for you to go through the x-ray machine what's on board said hey if they said hey lady\nRodents are not welcome\nSo I guess if you're a hamster person a rat person most person\nKnow that you will be refused the woman who refused to get off the flight the that's that's problematic really lady you from my money then you become a jerk\nBecause it held everything up big time everyone was deep playing so police could deal with the passenger everybody had to get off so you get a call the police\nEverybody's going to get off I'm guessing\nWell I don't know how would you would you yell at the lady hey lady come on would you say something like that I probably would I probably would\n\nIn Orlando police department spokesperson said the woman got off the plane once officers arrived so no further action was taken that was that happened at Logan would use Boston police officers or east Boston Boston police officers or would you use the state is that the barracks there I don't know how that would work\n[noise] video recorded at the terminal shows the woman defiantly partying departing accompanied by police as she grips her squirrels cage\nI could make comments about him and his dancing but I wouldn't because it's just not right why should I it's not right but it's it's good that he's happy I did feel like like you know that old rule if you can't say something nice don't saying something at all and love I mean like in I mean my trying to say\nYes and I'm not going to say the name was Paul no no no no why someone else that I gave them a headache to Munoz is run remember [laughter] I have lots\nOf people headaches okay but I just felt like it was not necessary there are times for criticism and there are times when it's like I don't know maybe I'm being too sensitive\nNo you're not really a backup view armed terrible\nShould've stick up for you all the time I call you and tell you how much we love you get so great the person who's criticized you clearly have the problem with the brain I mean the nice\nThings 'cause I mean of course I wouldn't call and tell you that if I didn't mean it that um [noise] so anyway I'm\nA comment about first of all you've been having a really great guess a ... you know they talk about the environment of course that's my thing\nBut I always I'm questioning of anybody who's promoting a business so this renewable energy business I don't know enough about it I've heard other experts say that it's not really the solution so I mean I don't know what the solution is but\nI think we need to question any body who's selling a something\nSomeone has a coupon that probably invested in this business and that doesn't mean that's a bad thing but we still need to look at it objectively no business wants to talk about what's really happening we are destroying our planet when demolishing all our fourth meadows with filling up oceans and rabbits with trash and waste and chemicals\nThere is a really brilliant um Harvard professor who is um a Nobel Prize winner ill Wilson and he says that we need to save half the or the nature I told you this before\nUm because nature can absorb the pollution and the things that we're doing it's not the only solution but a big part of what we're doing to our planet is cutting down forests with destroying everything and that liquid paving over everything so the earth can't it has can't bounce back\nBut nobody wants to talk about that and I just want to say that\nI didn't even stop making people we have to start saying oh I definitely\nWant to say that too but I just want to say that I Am morally invested in saving I planted not financially when someone's financially invested in something that doesn't make them a bad person but you need to question wait a minute\nWhat is really happening here they're going to make money by selling me this thing me gee I'm morally invest I'm not making money by saving our planet and by talking about a week after week after week so I and the only thing he said we need to prepare for nine billion people we\nKnow we should be trying to do human population not preparing for nine billion ten billion the earth is finite how much humidity kinda take so that's my speech and thank you for listening to me about ah being critical of\nYou know I'm Sorry that was marvel I was I was lame I was now\nBut I Wonder why you did have the tape you will like surprised that he said that I think and then you didn't say anything and I don't maybe even feel like maybe I was thinking you feel like well college should be able to express their opinions and I shouldn't always defend a caller\nI've I stuck up for you\nTo stay [laughter]\nAll right do you care if some if someone's making money on saving the planet I mean that may be the only way it gets done if people can make money because\nI'm not sure wind and solar is the solution I one of your callers said he has a problem with the solar panels on the roof I can see that I can see that that would be a problem and I mean and another one said that we use up all we dig up all kinds of minerals and we do all kinds of destructive things to the earth and I wanted to make these batteries in these panels and the wind turbines\nWe're destroying the earth in a different way I'm not saying oils right I don't know what's right I'm just saying\nWe need to listen very carefully when someone's trying to sell something because it may not be the solution it may add more problems\nSo um yeah I don't I just don't know about everything we do everything we do hurts the earth\nSo we have to if we did leave half the U.S alone that would be a major a major step in the right direction but but businesses and governments don't want to do that they want to exploit the planet for short term gang and only a handful really benefit from the short term gain\nThe rest of us make a little bit of money but ... only handful of people are making billions exploiting our planet\nRight and they have the they have the wherewithal the money to pay marketers and public relations people to tell us how great everything is\nSo I hear ya I write you a squirrel can be a legit comfort animal\nKnew you can ask me that you have to tell you I Can't comment on this because I Would be too worried about my animal like bringing my animal on the plane would cause me more stress because I'd be worried about my animals I couldn't concentrate on myself\nSo I don't really understand that whole thing of meaning and em I I don't want to put anybody down for that but my animal would not come from me I'm like my animals mother\nAnd I'd be worried the whole time bringing my\nIn or anyway I you know what I mean like I think I Love my animals the way I Would like my children so we're not company to bring them everywhere\nSo what animals do you have\nI don't have any now but growing up we had everything and I would love to have I Want dogs and cats again have horses but you know the money to do that right now in miniature horse I Know I I Love the big stock they get stuck with this on your family time the big ones I Know right now big cattle\nAnd that the court said the ... I don't know if you know that he made you know that but\nI couldn't believe I was in New Hampshire one time and these gigantic type Clydesdale that coming out and help me\nAnd lovely and I think the man said well they bred them that way because how could we can tell them you know versus the racial epithets but to be hyper yeah these big gigantic quick as it was so adorable I you know I just love animals yeah and how that All right we're you know you have a good weekend\nThat thrive on your you know a lot of animals yes you have a good weekend too All right ... thanks\nYes and I I feel guilty when I didn't stick up for I ...

what scares me and she sounds just like my mother in law [noise] and and and my mother in law watches Fox and it's it's I mean I I I didn't agree with everything President Obama did\nBut I still voted for him okay you can still disagree that the whole problem with with the people that are with him ... ... it's all I almost I'm sixty three and an almost feels like to me a call more than a\nDozen entire half of the country's bending over backwards\nIgnore to read to read the fine things that happened that or you know auto ignore all kinds of lies and sheeting and\nDisgusting when you measure ... and and\nWell he's a Christian and he's really you know coming around you don't have any no way you don't you don't have to demean yourself by jumping through all these hoops to say he's a good guy just say yeah he's a bum but I like what he's doing I can live with that you say yeah who am I going to ask you get it done and I can live with that\nI don't get why we love\nI wouldn't give me sixty percent of his politics or or what he's accomplished but I Am forty percent there there are certain things with these dom yep that I Can't disagree with hip but every ... within twenty four hours he does something to take away\nThe better it it's almost like he has to shoot himself in the foot like like with the lady I'm a before lady for three days he was presidential\nRight but then he gets up to one of those campaign rallies any it's like he asks cool [noise] I don't know you almost reminds me and my son when he was like ... you would say don't land Lamont and he knew he would go play and lunch\nAnd what ... where I lost it because I call last week and I don't know what WB ... requirements are money you can call ... studies so overworked\nRight he's been on the golf course two thirds of his presidency and the saddest part about that at least making money and when he was there right you know ... ... ... everything else\nAnd he's got that hotel right near the White House the people that you know people staying\nIn some time you think about it he's the only person and and I'm I'm Better than my head around this because I Love thinking politics but he's the only person that can manipulate the markets and not ever be charged with what do they call that the\n[noise] ... [noise] insider trading something like that he yeah\nHe can he knows what he can say he knows if he bashes apple on Monday the stock was going to drop at least ... percent so you buy you know what I'm saying I'm just\nWondering if they don't have ... we do know that he's profiting on average ... in in all honesty we don't know\nOkay and I agree with your ... your ... like\nEvery other Hannah that's that's where I have a real problem you know a nun I can make a new site do a Russian Lonnie right you know gear stock money right yeah I Try to be\nI Try to be a blow to I\nAnd so I uh he will always be my commander and chief\nFor any veteran was listening [laughter] we'd go to the office I Will salute him but you know uh he lost me when he was just some ... with the soccer ball that's when I said OK\nYeah and you know he was a choosing puente over our own intelligence\nYeah and in part of that as our age Bradley you know because we grew up in the Cold War and I do try to keep in mind because my absolute best friend in the world is a is a Trump or and my mother in law but sometimes you just have to walk away\nYeah a couple of things which are Joes those people he knows his people he knows that it's tough to underestimate them he knows that he can say whatever you want and he will they will believe him he knows he's a ... year\nAny any\nAnd now he works in you know good for him he my problem is not so much with him but the people who are an apologist for his\nEmbarrassing and bad behavior again why is just why he's just saying yeah they said that he does is bad but he does what I Want I guess I can get that\nSent the things that need doing really really need doing and it's worth having a jury if it has to be checked against them done somewhat leaves at MIT you don't condone that behavior if you can do that behavior that means your value system is entirely different than mine if you think it's OK acceptable or any way in a mock\nUnion if he needed help dealing with things they listen to me to be his personal shopper and financial manager to\nConvince lane nearly dad moved in with me so I became the personal assistant physical therapists and even now\nWhen I got to be taken care of the time\nI didn't realize all the rooms and I'd have to play ...

I Wish that President Trump\nTowards a maybe a\nYou know we have a country go into that direction as far as um you know these these um [noise] these guys on a boat you know fashion our president you know you know haters are going to hate you know the ... is a great job his his uh\nHis his policies that are coming into polish and and look at these radical progressive is I mean just think how how crazy man now [noise] and and what they're up to ... an analyst solving a congressman [noise]\nYou know look at that I'm Bernie Bernie ... within assaulted a Rand Paul was um you know\nLow on the lawn and that sounds like a Bernie a ... um supportive they try to guns and all of our congressmen while they were playing baseball you know they're very violent\nOr violent people they really need help and and the fact that the fact that you know I'm employment is so long now [noise] you know and and and I'm calling is doing so well in these people are still so violent and and I'm just\nAfraid for you know the big divide because you know just imagine if we had sixteen percent unemployment [noise] like they do in Puerto Rico\nI mean you know ... where what will of the country then\nYou know so I just I just want to congratulate a great president and the ah Kavanaugh [noise] um I'm apartment I thought it was very very good at a glove and [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm looking forward to the next the next um Supreme Court justice that is kind of one point and you know I just want to\nTell you that I really enjoy your show I'm Bradley and and I appreciate you would hear on boss and this is a great spot you're right it is a late night now you're a song or the true grates of Boston radio and and you're you're you're getting better all the time I think is so much\n\nWB Z thank you very much Nick ... one thing that's going to happen if the\nDemocrats regain power which I doubt and I think they blew it is that they're going to end very short order\nDemand and and when that there's not even ... won't even debate be a debate if they have enough power in Congress they're going to demand to see the tax return\nWould you like to see the ... we've got those of which side you're on wouldn't you want to see the tax return\nI mean obviously Democrats would want to see this tax return but wouldn't even fans want to see the tax return wouldn't you be curious or you don't care why would the president not won his tax return\nPublic is he a criminal may ... is it just a small crime or or maybe it's a big crime\nWouldn't even want to know\nIf the president were shown to be a criminal after divulging his tax returns would you\nBe okay with that I well I don't I'm not even going to ask that I Know you would be okay with it if you're a supporter you would find some way to be okay with it I wouldn't be okay with it I don't rule follower and I don't like when people win by cheating\nSo as far as I'm going to vote for please please show me a moderate Republican in these in these upcoming years I'll vote for that person\nLike John cases maybe you should go for it again you just didn't have the charisma to get\nGet elected let's go to\nAnd in Michigan and hello [noise]\nOh hi Brad um yeah I agree with you on the are showing the income tax um\nIn fact I think it's never going to happen in Trump's rain but they should have a law uh it it's just the responsible thing to do to let\nCitizens no the background of these candidates that they're voting for and the other issue I wanted to bring up real quick that no one is talking about\nAnd I do think that Democrats should use it on their platforms is a big hole in Medicare that's going to happen but it won't happen right away it to a few years off but when they passed that big tax break\nA huge huge huge hole and Medicare and I'd just like to war and all the people that are planning on retiring and they have a medical care\nOr they they should Google that look look it up and also there's going to be a big coal and Medicaid\nFor our last I'm fortunate citizens as well in this country and that's pretty much all I have to say\nOther than I Love your show and thank you and ... and to add to that\nThe president and the Republicans one thing I don't like about them is they want to take away protections against ... pre existing conditions which means if you have any sort of problem you have to pay more for insurance or you won't be able to get it at all because\nThe way the Republicans are is that they're the big business people and I agree that the Democrats are way way way too extreme way to a progressive and they'll never win if they continue like that\nAnd as a bummer because\nI don't want the Republicans to be able to take away protections against\nPreexisting conditions 'cause that is universally loved thing about\nThe ... ... yeah I like it overall but everybody likes to that part of it but the Republicans want to take that away so you have to decide basically it's this which is more important to you\nI Know the major issue is immigration I get that it's important to have strict immigration but\nIf you vote for Republicans do controlling immigration you do that at a severe cost which is they're going to take away your protections against pre existing conditions straight away which one will hurt your life more\nYes immigrants coming in or you not being able to get insurance\nYeah well enjoy your show\nThanks a lot okay we take care okay\nYes that's at Michigan there it's a we don't really have time John and say I'm going to have to get to you first right after the break OK\nYeah there is that I Would love to see the president's I'm just curious about the tax return I mean it's weird that we can see the tax return and it's weird that there's no Mac mechanism to force that the only mechanism if the by some miracle the Democrats regain power\nThen you'd see is tax return and a couple of months and we'd we would see what's up I'm guessing that Muller knows what's in his tax return I mean I'm guessing\nI'm curious by the way they're ... they're going to have a written questions for the president that's pretty interesting to\nSix one Seventy five or ten thirty at night to address question want on the upcoming Massachusetts pilots some as well that nursing a patient nurse ratios super important and the opposition is confusing it it's busy\nSamaritans

C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never a\nYou know it's it's almost like a sports team you know I got the Yankees you get the red Sox\nBut it is I don't have to be this way you know why what happened to the middle there used to be like a you know when Reagan was the president was going to Tip O'Neill and I'm In charge of Congress there was some kind of eating across the aisle\nFeel like ignorant just basic ignorance is something that allows this to happen in order to think about individual\n\nIssues you have to have some sort of intelligence or does I just I feel like this is a huge amount of ignorance on both sides both sides arguing a debate ignorant lane and boring actually\n[noise] it it's almost like there isn't even a debate in Lawrence just become this\nClose minded you know I'm told by this media network or whatever and I'm not going to go into the media but there is some control their of of the mind when these people can't think of themselves and an el even go back to your I forgive me I think his name was ... and I'm not sure in each other I already know what he's going to shape\nBut that was Nick in Boston\nI Apologize [noise] so I and I loved that I Love that that you know even if you already know that you disagree with somebody I Love to listen to what they're saying because I might learn something and it's just everybody's just closed her mind so much they just don't even want to\nHear what the other side of fame and all of American\nIt's a nice change that for one thing\nBut it's OK Hillary lying was a problem you know lying Hillary lying Hillary did is there's no doubt it's observing bleach true everyone knows it's actually the president is a massive massive liar who's actually incapable of telling the truth\nBut you if you bring that up in any sort of discussion about is this president's fit that totally doesn't count anymore so the rules are different\nNow it's it's it's frustrating like it would be frustrating to play chess with somebody who didn't play by the rules it's like playing chess or somebody that says\nThat's not a crook that's a bishop you know no no that's definitely a rock oh no that's a bishop or they say you see the all the pond can move seven spaces over and then ... at seven to the left saying no no the cat\nOh yeah they can just it's frustrating to the same level you are you in order to converse that has to be certain ground rules should be certain recognitions of of things that exist and when it comes to Trump\nThey're not just supporters not just people who support the policies but apologist fanatics that they ... you can't have any discussion because\nDiscussion has rules and they don't follow the rules is the same sort of thing is trying to\nConvince a newer as Christian that the earth is four point five billion years old that just the science and normal\nThe discussion techniques don't work\n[noise] I I I totally agree with you I really do and you know goes back to the other caller that you are asking will let you Christian\nUm [noise] where I don't understand where people lost their way where they became so part of that they can't even just step back and say put anybody is going on that ... Obama trunk whatever they're doing if if it's wrong it's wrong call him out on it but the like you said this blind\nYou know just following oh well you know I'm going to follow him it doesn't matter what he does you know grab them or whatever it doesn't matter you know it was you know if it was Hillary or Obama oh gosh you know he's talking about grabbing people you know we should\nBut like you said it's it's it's just a park or see where they can't even see or step back and I'm a famous from both sides\nSays where they have to do was lie to themselves they have a lot and I don't know why you need to do that folks why do you need to lie to yourself to commit yourself the president is awesome all\nYou need to do is just be in favor of what he's doing you don't have to convince me of every or anyone that he's a good man or a Christian or anything to\nSay yeah he's doing what I Want that's all you need to do that I'm fine with that\nSure [laughter] I totally agree with you it used to be you know when Clinton was running a\nBill Clinton in Ninety two it was oh he is another veteran blah blah blah ... oh that's okay it doesn't matter from people who are saying that just Twenty years ago they forget that you know that was there that was their issue or he's being a ... a abusive with a cigar in the White House\nThey were they were consensual first of all but now this is going on oh that's okay don't worry about that he he's a good guy like you said and it's just is blind faith where people are just losing their way and and and you know\nThe leading their neighbors or their family because you know their political views looks just like people just need to remember we're all in their hand with like I said at the beginning red white and blue streak colors on the flag it's hard just red and blue so it's almost become like I said a football or baseball game where you got this site I get that side we\nCan ... mental right it's not a game is is all of her future right and you can't do it\nSo all you can do is vote really discussing it is\nBoth fruitless and\nFrustrating because uh okay you can have you you can find out the president was really guilty of some horrific crime and it wouldn't matter folks like the woman who said that he's a good Christian would also say well they say first they say well you know take a look at Bill Clinton and then they would say well you know that's in the past\nOr I don't look at what other people did they would find a way to adjust to it a good thing whatever this crime was and\nIt's it's weird we'll see what happens is the thing is you might as well I think you're going to be it used to what he's going to be around for eight years\nTotal ... yeah I don't have to get used to I can just tune it out but it's it's sad right like I said it'll happen\nIt's right it's not the end of the world because he's not he's not the policies and when he does not terrible that so I it makes me just kind of want to shut up and you know it's not the worst thing in the world to have a great economy\nSo I just I Would just go along in like the stuff he does that I like and not like the stuff he does that I don't like and not but I won't try to convince people that he's a bad guy because they're never going to go to acquiesce to the\nShirt I totally agree with you there I'm not trying to convince anybody\nI I probably agree with more than half of what some people would say from one side half of what other people see from the other but you just have to stand back and just realize that we're all living together and we'll all affecting each other by yeah like you said this is a you know just not even soon right before you what's going on\nAs with the tax return with I mean that would be or how many times has gone bankrupt\nAnd I'm not trying to to knock him as somebody who either like Trump thirty or forty years so it's not anything just because he's become president I didn't like come on TV or whatever but why is his tax returns not an issue now where every other parts of it before but they\nYou know we had to see what you know what\nWe're trying to reach those hey you're a criminal if you don't show me your tax return that's got to be the only reason why\nThe hiding something but not like a bully hasn't care if he's a criminal right\nI'm not a Trump supporter but I Do wish him the best because your facts all of our future threats are going to say oh I don't like Trump I Wish him the worst I you know I Hope he's a one term president you\nKnow none of that as I Am let\nMe take this opportunity to to remind folks to some of the things that are going well I don't think is a bad thing that immigration has slowed I don't think it's a bad thing that cities cooperate with eyes I don't like\nI don't like us sanctuary cities anymore than he does it's a good thing that the economy's doing well if he really did a\nReorganized NAFTA so it works better get a better deal that's cool\nI Do think that it Obama's position on his foreign policy was weak this could be better foreign policy I don't mind that he yells at ... at a United Nations for not\nPaying other countries are not paying their fish is a lot of stuff that's good and I can acknowledge that I I just kind of was the other people would acknowledge that bad\nIt is something wrong with them in the head that they do\nYeah no I totally agree with you I and I agree with all those points you just made I Do too I think sometimes like you look at some of the countries in Europe they have a huge immigration problem people flooding across that they're losing you know yeah I I totally agree with you uh you know [noise]\nOr John I'm twenty nine or ... or you don't call very much I I Hope because you know not\nLike I said I just came back to the area from the west coast so glad to be back in the box where you guys are the best so there'll be ... feet it then around forever so glad to tune in for you guys are still doing it so\nHe got back

guy on the tea it's interesting\nMorning MBTA ride is is pretty interesting you see the same people every day in the same spot every day and not just on the the car but they stand on the platform in the same place every day 'cause I walked Wellington station\nGo down to the platform\nAnd I know who I'm going to see as I Walk along the platform\nAs good as a couple of ... there's a certain construction workers always here uh everyone stands in the same place out of habit it's a it's a comforting thing and you know what I Do the same thing I go to the same spot every day\nAnd I kind of stand beside the same guy on the platform and given the car then this kind of a mad rush for seats because contrary to what you might think it's crowded the first training in the morning second trend in the morning crowded\nI guess because it's the first train people would go earlier if they could but they can't so they wait for the string\nAnd there's a big what do you call it a musical chairs for seats the orange line is obscene Lee loud it's like a roar\nOf secure on jet plane to put an airport and read the book then you get to I got to connect somewhere\nAnd then everyone who is on the train that's getting off gets off at the same time and goes in stands again in the same place and they cluster up here on the platform of the orange line they don't costs are up I guess 'cause there are more doors\nThey know exactly where the doors are going to stop same on the green line fewer doors so there are fewer places to stand and they kind of clump up and they know exactly where the trains going to stop and when the doors open\nAnd they want to get a seat same thing\nWe'll sit in the same sees as a couple of good on they sit in the same seats it's pretty interesting and I just I have a habit I go to the back don't away and I don't like sitting in the seats with two side by side I Want I Want to sit in one of the solo seats\nI can read my book peace so when I get on the green line is sort of crowded then it gets super crowded with nurses and stuff\nAnd\nI Know now where people get on where people get off\nOf course much people get on and off park but also there are other key places a business where the in the hospital area a bunch of\nNurses give off in a bunch of support stuff a lot of people weren't scrubs in the morning I don't know if I like the idea of people wearing scrubs to work his why\nHospitals should be kind of a clean place and you're wearing scrubs to work and you're ... you're sitting on the subway seats in your scrubs and he knew where it goes into the hospital environment\nAnd and you're brushing up against MBTA\nWell those polls those metal poles is all kinds of germs and there there's a germ factory I don't think he should be able to do that I think you really should be changing at a hospital I get it that way you have to have lockers and it would be a pain in smoke convenient\nI Wonder how many fatal\nInfections have been caused by people wearing that scribes to work and riding on the tea I hate to be gruesome but just try swapping those seats throwing it on a petri dish\nYou're going to be drawn ... as tall as the fields of corn\nAll kinds of bad stuff flew germs oh my God\nWe trust me they don't wipe those things down", "show_name": "Jay Talking with Bradley Jay", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "12"}
