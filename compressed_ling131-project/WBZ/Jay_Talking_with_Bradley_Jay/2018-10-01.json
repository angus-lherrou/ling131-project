week\nBut whatever I'm not really politically motivated by this because they're going to have a conservative judge one way or the other the interesting thing to me that the strategy and need another interesting thing to me is\nThat\nThe judge is supposed to be non political really as nonpolitical as possible you can't really avoid it of course\nBut they're not supposed to be overtly political and this is Kevin that person as overtly political he openly hates the Democrats and sure maybe it's a justified but that doesn't change the fact that he does\nAnd\nYou can eat hates hates hates them is the point where he might educate based on that hey based on political bias deserved or not also it's pretty clear relied so there is the initial\n\nPossibility of sexual assault ... many of you I'd say most of you in this audience don't think that that's a deal breaker you don't think it's that big a deal even add a woman named Joanne say basically it's no big deal ladies get over it\nYeah Joanne\nYou said that do you ever think joined that it might make men also think that it's no big deal\nAs it might reinforce in men it's not that big deal even joy even Joanne said it's not that big

C. news radio ten thirty weather news was never says um [noise]\nHanging on the L Word because it was a gay\nMale announcing exactly and it's they don't think that's quite so just got thing it's it's not that shouldn't have never happen because it's not a normal thing\nWhere you know bad thing and it's like that I think it's interesting I think I think no matter no matter who happens to it's horrendous thing no reason I don't I don't I'm not getting him I think\nThey're awful for saying that that that it's it's more excusable you know it's okay for the men not to come forward by the women should always come forward but when you look back at this I mean I Hope I'm not one and that's what I'm Talking about progression it's like okay so this is twenty Eighteen to hopefully now we're going to teach\nYou know I'm going to eat and lightning which is the goal\nThat women will no women come forward much sooner now because people talk about it now back when I was in high school in the seventies and then this happened in the early eighties even then no one talked about sexual assault like they do now because hopefully we've learnt is Heidi that\nWe have to talk about it openly because and I think what really broke open the thing about sexual assault is the Catholic Church [noise]\nUm case of sexual abuse because everyone started talking about all kinds of sexual abuse not just\nThe church but all kinds of things that happened to people against their will and I think that's what people are getting away from two in this case with duct Ford is that\nShe was basically even though people that all it only lasted thirty forty seconds or a minute or two minutes put a timer on and you walk yourself in a room because she got locked in a room like now\nAnd what two boys that is what she stating right and one held his hand over her mouth that's what she stating how long how long do you think thirty seconds fields when someone's got their hand over your mouth\nAnd and someone else's standing in front of a door another person is standing in front of the door that you can't get out of\nLaw do you think wow laughing\nAnd how how long do you think thirty second is it's an eternity you know what I mean and that's what people are getting away from that she was held against your will first of all in a room by two people not by one\nSo I think judge is almost is as guilty as he is because he stood there and watched it happened if that if this all gets proven and which I totally believe but a lot of people don't believe it but\nI'm ... and then that heat you know like you know twenty seconds like watch sports twenty second is an eternity in sports\nSo do you think twenty seconds when you're being sexually assaulted\nAnd also when it's already\n[laughter] you know and I think that people losing that in his whole this whole scenario is that just played out in your mind walk around the room for twenty seconds thirty seconds forty five seconds and say ... that's that's you know get over it because it didn't even last that long and he didn't even get your clothes off\nOkay so if women get grouped on the train and they're fully closed and the group or is fully clothed\nThey shouldn't they shouldn't bother complaining because they're fully closed when\nIt happened of course you can play someone put their hands on you and they should and\nShe does she know review come on\nBut maybe you know maybe that's her mechanism for doing for herself to get over it but\nYou don't you don't just get over something I mean I I was sexual assault and when I was a teenager and maybe I should get over it but I don't know it's still plays in my mind what no I moved on I live my life I've I've worked of you know what I mean but it's still always comes back to at\nCertain times and when we come back\nOr some other things get talked about or you know what I mean and and you know you if you oh you see people that were around you at the time and and you know you know ... you know memories of when you're a kid when you when it happened\nAnd what happened to me or it in\nAnd said okay but you yeah you have to but it's still doesn't make it that it wasn't wrong when it happened\nYou know what I mean and you have a new new and you probably do not\nKnow I told you I I was I was Seventeen and I didn't tell I ... I finally told the woman a woman that I babysat for um like a couple years later only because I was so afraid\nFirst of all I thought I put myself in that position that shouldn't have happened and secondly [noise] um\nI didn't know who won\nThe up and then secondly I was afraid if I did and it didn't hold my I never told my parents because I I think my father was killed the guy and um but uh in it and then also too and I didn't know that those are the things that you come to like oh my God what if I tell the face say this\nAll the other people that it could affect their lives\nAnd you know\n... and right and I didn't want them to be hurt by something that someone named new did to me you know what I'm saying so\nThat they were that they were close to that that this person did to me so I never told and it it took me forever to tell if someone in my immediate family I think I just told people in my family not even five or ten years ago you know what I mean so\nAnd I'm sixty and I'm sixty years old Oh absolutely some yeah absolutely no no no no\nNo you know of of of friends of friends or family member so it's just\nThat you know so as a you know and it's just something that you know it wasn't it didn't it didn't last long like they say and blah blah blah but you know it happens and you know there's all levels of sexual assault and\n[laughter] and if it happens all the time and it just but you know but I just and like I said that the biggest thing to me is that I think people are getting away from\nIs the fact that they went into a room and lock the door and there was two of them and you know what I mean and so if you're feeling like they said well she how could she have gotten away it was two athletes to have you ever seen football players right in high school\nOkay is holding these guys she clearly said he was his\nJob who worked out every single day so obviously we some great physical shape\nShe was Fifteen going on sixteen you know girls she looked cruise I mean she's not she's not a big person now so\nI mean I imagine a fifty to sixty ... young girl and so there's two boys that are much bigger than you locking you in a room and one on top of you\nAnd you know what I mean how how do you think you're going to get out of there and even if it's a minute like I said forty five seconds that that's that's a lifetime to a Fifteen year old and\nYou know and I just I don't I don't see how people are getting past that pot and he said oh she went on to yeah cushion when she moved on she went to college she she's very smart woman obviously ... you don't have all those degrees in psychology and and do it she's accomplished but\nThings start pouring back and she said the reason she went to therapy five or six years ago was when they were redesigning her house and then we're going to cut off some during her house to like make room like on a wall and to take a list stories and she insisted on keeping an extra doorway in a room\nAnd that's when it things that try and get her her her recall as being claustrophobic and being trapped\nAnd and she turned her husband down into this big to do over it and he couldn't understand why she was so sad about keeping an extra dorm or in a room and they ended up going to counseling over it and it all spilled out in counseling and that's usually what happens\nAnd and people are getting away from that because it's all about\nYeah I think I think possibly that we handled badly on both sides and to be honest I mean I'm a I'm a I'm a registered Democrat but\nI really think I can name for people on that Judiciary Committee that need to go and retiring go away and two of them are on the left and two of them are on the right one of them is leaving on hatch\nBut I'm Sorry Grassley Feinstein Laiki patch they're all well actually lately he's the or the spring chicken and the thing but he's Seventy eight years old but I mean sorry eighty five eighty six you know what I'm saying\nI and it's been there and he's been there for forty four years she's been fined signs and if a twenty eight years Grassley has been there since I think the last supper and\nSo his aren't hatch but you know what I mean it's like come on now it's like this this is this is this is why you can't enlightened people because these people\nGrow up in a in an era where none of this was ever talked about and and they're trying to decide about history moving forward and they always talk about the founding fathers the founding fathers were not eighty five years old\n\nPotters and Jesus from both sides of the Iowa right out of their seats and I think we as a country will be much much better for it because maybe maybe people will start talking to each other because\nIt doesn't really matter where you sit on the political spectrum Bradley some horrendous people sit right next to you and feel the same way about politics do you do wherever you are okay and there are also some very good people who are at the opposite end of the spectrum for you and I think\nWe got to start getting back to that and like I said\nI have to go to the news now would you like to me to hold you over are you all set\nA ...

passionate about this because I like I said I I feel like human rights an animal rights of the same thing it comes from the same I'm kind of thinking but first I Want to say that I Love the name Veronica too um did you did you read the Archie Comics when your kid\nEnough to love the named Veronica Veronica with the raven haired beauty back lipstick right\nAnd I don't think so she had black hair black shiny black hair with like blue highlights in it and then I'm Betty was the blonde and Archie Betty but he couldn't Veronica was always after him I think he kind of was torn between the two [noise]\nIt was fun but um [noise] so\nI Want to just say about I Want to kind of correct for on it's not really correction I mean I agree with her that the the um [noise] the the church and then the men probably more sympathetic to males because it's a male on now but I Would say\nIt's not about gay it's pedophilia it's adult males on children and and that is just that the crime no matter how you look at it right\nAnd I would also remind people um I Believe I could be wrong but I don't think I'm wrong about this and the beginning it was about twenty or Thirty years ago\nWhen children that it's the adult started speaking up about what happened to them as kids both males and females and people do not believe them and people wanted to shove it under the rug nobody wanted to deal with it\nAnd now with the check I mean it's it's like I said it's been like twenty or Thirty years and so to hear that the church and so many of them I mean it's just impossible to deny that pedophilia happens I think\nSo that's why people I think a sympathetic to it but I Do agree with her that\nIt's more natural for men to be attracted to women and it could be um [noise] you know interpreted more flirting not so much of the salt even though it's not flirting if you are forcing someone as far as this case I I don't know who's telling the truth and I understand that people are upset on both sides\nBut I Would say that don't we know that the majority of salt is by males on women and children and other males to don't we know that\nI mean how many of your callers have said to you they have been assaulted I yeah I think it was um [noise] cow for Martin Joanne Veronica and\nDolly grungy\nDug in Glen and I want to say about Dolly\nDolly said that it was no big deal there were men grabbed her upper body parts but I think it's a very big deal I mean it's a big deal that old man thought it was okay to touch her without her permission if we have complete ownership of our bodies we don't\nI mean no one should touch you unless you get the permission I mean what does freedom mean if we don't at least respect other people's bodies first and that it's their space\nI own my body I get to decide who touches me if we don't have that at the freedom what do we have and then I'll end up with um I'm finished with about Tom Cavanaugh I I and people are saying it's about privilege in upper class and and of course there is some of that but I still\nI think it's more about male privilege all over our planet in our country it's white male privilege in the middle east it's Muslim male privilege and it's all about men owning women children in animals and it's been that way for so long that people I just think we're all condition to not really recognize\nHow insidious lead bad this is and I think that so many of our problems about this this male privilege and last week I had said she good guys of the best people on the planet and I really mean that men have always been there for me\nBut the thing with men is they have a team mentality and it's really hard for them even when they're good guys to go against their burrows so their colleagues because I think that why a to B team players\nAnd um I Would just say once again I Want the good males to start standing up against the bad guys and saying it's not right it's not cool it's not funny\nAnd we will not have a better world unless we all start sticking together about this [noise] so that's all I have to say about it\nWell you write your caller's been great lately\nI'm Glad you think so I mean I'm just so passionate about human rights an animal rights I Want the world to be better for everyone it it makes it breaks my heart to think that\nLittle kid being assaulted animals are being abused women are being treated badly I Do I Can't stand it it's wrong and we should all want the world to be a better place for everyone I mean I Know it sounds idealistic but I think it's possible but it's only possible if we all stick together\nAnd I agree with everyone who said a Veronica and make fun situ it that the senators are too old but I Would say he was a Mike was saying Trump Trump's too old I think they cut off point should be sixty five for a government officials what do you think\nAnd no I don't know ... too old\nBut his idea old he has that male idea about I should be able to do whatever I Want I mean ... you know what he said the things that he said before he was elected yeah\nThat's an old way of ... I Hope it's an old way of thinking I Hope we're going to eradicate that way of thinking right and we can only do it with your help what do you good guy\nI don't think women can do it all and we need you good guys to help us we can't do that I'm not one of those women who think we don't you know someone that maybe think we don't ... I don't agree that we don't need men I Need man I Love men but I Want the good guys not the bad guys and and\nI uh I found a toy dinosaur over on the playground ... street uh it had this number on it and well I I just wanted to make sure the dinosaur I made it back to excel owner [noise]\nYeah Hi I think I found your kids' stuffed animal near the swing set 'em just want to call I'm sure she misses it [noise]\nI Know my son gets your protests at the smallest things even a fire truck and I'd be happy to dropped off [noise]\nI was a little nutty cell cleaned it up and it's good to go whenever you're around [noise]\nWhen I found a little sip a cup I just had to give you a call for it you know\nWe do anything for kids yet one in six children in the U.S struggle with hunger helped end childhood hunger in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and give all of our kids the meals they need to grow signed your local food bank at Feeding America dot org ... by Feeding America and the ad council\nRight you know he is ... she'll\nYou don't know what I think there's been much radio radio radio\nJ tell these these radio\nGoes W.

in the nursing home she was there for about eight years in her life have don't have a few gave it was a she was a under the influence or I'm I'm pretty sure morphine and I was thinking to myself gee I Wonder\nIf that was really necessary you know click or if if a person found a way I don't think she was in pain that I Know of course she might have been and I'm I'm thinking to myself gee you know I Wonder if that was right you know to be on morphine\nYou know at the end of days and and but she was able I remember my brother John you know he's gone now to he got about a year after my mother and

reading and spoils it\nNever never noticed spread like I I don't watch it all the time you know but whenever something important happened in ... or ... it it's a good idea to watch it because see what faith and that bill about it\nYou know so generally also one thing that happened on their it on Saturday Night live but was not aired I think it got cut out is Kanye West went on a\nPro Trump rants and oh yeah I was\nSo interesting services seem interesting Bradley yet you know what I've\nBeen reading lately um a book called gene get set in my life in prophecy and you've got a very interesting when you when she was a little again girl somebody a woman who like if you could read fortunes look at her hand\nWith ... the chief what they felt like she ... her hand say like the one hand showed\nA half moon whatever that means the other hand I don't know what every show it was very impressed this woman and she knew she was going to be very psychic and you've got you remember she ... you know that the cloud over the White House when before Kennedy guy\nYeah and sell it interesting I I think she's gone she must have died a number of years ago\nBut this woman was so impressed that should

V. the buses WXXI K. U. M. H. D. two men and I had radio station\n\nAs far as what I didn't I didn't have\nYou asked me how I Would defend I said I guess the same way the judge did only I Would try not to be angry\nWell here's a human being and he's being at that say look if if the if he was calm or liberals would say well he he was to con must be guilty so he's angry\nThat means he's not fit to be on the bench so I ... no matter what this man does says just like President Trump demanded what he does a says he's always guilty he's always wrong\nIt's the same tool on everything suspects assault can I this is all connected by the way so the fact that he's saying we doesn't bother me at all at least the human being and he's being charged heinous crime I think he has a right to defend himself with the human\n... program they just go along with everybody wants to hear\n[noise] technically not to be in charge of the crime well it's not a court of law\nAnd the the the burden of proof is different\nWell I I haven't heard anything first of all she wasn't even cross examined properly\nThat woman and ... says this is not the process you don't do five and a five minute intervals and then you go back and I suddenly also question then you come back we'll have to persist sit down and talk and let them tell this story and the rule one on one so that was bad concept by the Republicans I should have never done that\nSo that there's too many holes in his story she was not believable to me so I'm not going to say she was proud about ... again you can say compelling but you can be compelling and also be a liar\nSo um\nThis is a life this has to match people just can't say anything without backing about any proof this is America you're innocent before guilty that's how it works it works anybody that comes in front of a court no matter how fish issue are or how it has sent us this is the way it works here and if we go down that road we're going to be in big trouble\nSo say you were abused by a priest yeah your word against his word yeah\nAnd\nSo you you're selling me according to you you would not be able to bring it up 'cause you have no proof\nOr\nI didn't set with and bring it up I Would bring it up\nWhen you have no proof\nI have no proof but if I felt that yeah well you're right I don't have proof it a lot of people don't have proof here right on that aspect but this this man going on I'm going talking about what she said\nI'm Talking about what she said I didn't see that you did it changed her best friend was there a best friend was there and said she did not see him there he was not there\nSo how can you just find that the ones that are now she says you may recall but what does that mean she does any color I don't understand it you know what I mean\nAll these different do not recall than it is the recall that he was not there\nWell I'll I'll and I'll I'm telling you that it had America you need proof as far as these people that you just brought up for an example as far as the Frisco\nA that show somebody can say something about a priest and it can be exactly follow Chely Wright usually there's a history of this usually are the people come forward to substantiate\nIf this place has done something so you used this usually a history of sexual crimes I Believe when people continue to do this and I can't believe the judge did all of this for two years and was driving the ... are\nGetting women high and ah\nAnd doing all this it's like one thing after the other day this is all politically motivated and anybody that's really looking at this can see that for what it is\nThey hate this man said three reasons I give you the three reasons why they hate him first of all these conservative second of all he believes in the constitution and third he loves God and then she had three reasons why liberals would hate his guts\nOkey dokey that's how I got to say thank you both very good job thank you Frank alright\nIs also one other reason didn't forget he's a Trump nominee so there's more there are for reasons at least that they would be a beef with him to board team I'm a commander of his ship here and we're going to go\nSteer the starship over towards Durham New Hampshire and bill in Durham\nHello bill I read like a real quick um that lady a Ford or entered\nTestimony she said she was one hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh had assaulted her she also provided the names of four witnesses [noise]\nNone of them what backer up ... none of them had any knowledge of the incident\nNow whether it happened or not she was the same ... the same person who said she was on a ... percent sure gay for witnesses that reputed her story I'm Sorry\nBut that's all there is too going beyond that his mind reading\nDid they reviewed the story just as a matter of technicality and I know you're a tech guy did they refuted are just not corroborate it is different\nThey didn't ... they they didn't know anything about it okay\nThey ... they and and it seems like if a little more attention since visual were on vacation or this had been you know coming on for some time and I'm a I think one of the other stories or the woman said that uh he was\nFirst dog she's older than ... than he is so she was a bit in college when he was in high school and she went to high school parties were girls were being gang raped\nI kinda doubt that at the high school age that you got as a Ted this guy goes to ten parties that I think it was eight or ... was the word and nobody knows about it now that that's absolutely crazy crap\nUm so I think that can be discounted um [noise] and then we have the third one at a a I Believe Yale and uh who said he exposed himself to her\nYet uh I don't believe that Santa Claus ... collaboration on that and they have plenty of people that were in what they called his ... a lot of the unit and remembered yells liberal college and they're backing up a conservative\nUm and it was signed by I think sixty people or something like that just like the other one was signed by over sixty people where he'd worked at the White House and stuff\nUm and the third one\nI'm trying to think what where am I oh yeah we we covered all through the the one from Colorado was calling up her friends and and asking them what they remember so obviously she does remember very well and certainly should remember well enough to go and make claims\nOn national TV the plenty of things that I Know about I just can't prove or not not in this case I mean my life and even even in a situation I had with the property I own\nA I think you know where that is next to the white church yeah I'm\nA the church had this idea that I didn't own the road next to my house\nAnd so they ... uh uh I send them back a letter saying I did and they had one of their church members who was a trustee of trust funds\nUm for the town and I took his job actually when he retired and uh we have to read dates for the cemetery and very carefully a a measure it out because if you don't get it right gotta cut the handles off that uh the coughing to get it in any way um\nUh it's it's a very deep\nThis fellow they chose went back to them and I know some of those that the media and said Mr hall owns all of the property and has all the rights and he says he does they still wouldn't accept it they had a four thousand dollar survey done\nWho and I have a copy of the survey and apparent for when I'm told the letter said the same things I said and they said I'm a person told me about it said I might as well written that\nThat wasn't good enough for them and used a pin had they were doing some work over there and the town forced them to put in and around the corner of my property to resolve this\nThat wasn't good enough for\nSo one of the church or a ... a committee members a high in the ... running the church where it was they had a meeting with some of these people\nAnd he explained it to him and he told me that there were people their heads down just shaking their heads back and forth in other words they got something in their mind that was just proved every single way you can dispose of it and they couldn't accept\nAnother friend of mine says he has to take something over and showing the corner my property that different people are regularly a once a month or something and he told me this just recently\nUh they they and there is a problem here um because we got into trouble down the road for their work I have rights over the property and it didn't there was a girl from I won't say Colombia\nOr the the the college in New York she was there the town of ministry are there and they didn't understand it said he'd it says right of way and it has my name and the paragraph and that\nJust didn't seem to have any effect on them whatsoever and now I'm On that one pretty quickly uh I had to hire a lawyer and he sent them a letter and they realized that there was going to be people in spirit court with a quick if this kept up but eat some people you just can't reason with Bradley [noise]\nIf you had to get a straight out of production can make a judgment somebody really done a lot of time\nSo if I Am not Christian Abdi on level I have

and dance um show us quite ...\nAnd uh when I was young I was in Holyoke they're getting a pet\nI'm right near where we live to build a new community center and it's filled with rainwater and my brother\nTumbled down at the pet and it wasn't keeping up to drown or anything and I ran and got my mom and got the neighbors and save them and it's something we didn't talk about for years it wasn't talked about and about\nFifteen Years ago I I brought it up my family\nAnd never happened and never happen I swore happen and you know I'm not a storyteller I not delusional um it was just something that in my mind\nYeah you know I had a dream or something you know I'm not saying this woman's screaming or wherever I'm just saying sometimes people's realities\nUm don't match with what really happened especially when something that happened so long ago\nThere were a couple of reasons why I don't find her credible I'm warning you probably heard her say that she doesn't like flying and that's why she couldn't come to Washington to meet with Grassley about is very important um a moment in our life\nBut you find out why or something like that\nOr why she applies to Delaware to go to the beaches twice a year and she made a point she was clear should never food Australia um she wanted us to think a certain thing when I'm asked to pay for attorney she didn't know how to answer she knew the answer\nShe didn't know how to answer it and that's something that she was a ... for ... there were all there are things like that that\nYou don't want the\nTiming of this we all understand

that\nWell I'm Sorry but sometimes the reality sets in when you're in your fifties\nWell thank you know what I wanted I Want to talk about cabinet little I'm okay\nYou know I think people go back and your watch some Youtube video of his um [noise] what you were saying you know like when when you when\nWhen he talked to him Senator Leahy from Vermont\nHe's questioned him three times over like the past Eighteen years every time he was gone for a advancement in the courts he has questioned him and he's lied to them every time but at this time he actually had the emails and he he was talking about\nStolen emails and he kept saying I don't know what you're talking about another song and he said\nThat these are my emails how did you get my emails to another senator another Democrat Senate Democratic senator how did you get these emails in your email box any totally never answer the question he just went around and around and that is directly lying\nTo Congress you know and\nI just I didn't find incredible to be honest I I I don't know what if it's because people will listen to Fox News\n'cause I Know some women that are like lately like the\nThe lady was line and I'm like you gotta be kidding me she ... the lady wants to do an FBI\nInvestigation she pass a test and even what she said that those people might not know might not be remember that it was a party because she said it was at a party it was just like five people hanging out at a house\nIt wasn't that big um it wasn't a big party that people would have remembered\nAnd I'm okay\nThen a bunch of senators were asking what about an FBI investigation and he never agree to he just he just went around and around\nIf that was me I Would be demanding an FBI investigation demand a lie detector test yeah and he just refused to do it and um I mean it's all politics on both sides but that may look up\nGamble I don't know but he wants to get it I was sleeping for a couple of hours but I'm Campbell is a case coming up in the Supreme Court\nStarting tomorrow morning Monday morning and in the fall session opens up that's why they wanted to jam up through and it's the gamble G. G. A. M. B. L. E. and that's about double jeopardy and it's about which means that people don't understand it when the federal government prosecutors\nTo prosecute you and you'll be the case\nThat can go after you and it's like for the state the state and go after you and this is all directly about Russia and the origins of Trump can ... people and they you know they're going out for them in that state\nFederal they go after much date but look up gamble and hey back to the recommendation of the active measures that movie is just fantastic\nYes oh my God makes you you share that with everybody and I\nDo I yeah I mean it's unbelievable it puts all the pieces together you know\nWhat was the most shocking thing they use in there was it was it the monitoring\nI've seen all that stuff before I've seen I've been reading up on this stuff for a couple of years so not that really shocked me but more about how um who went to Hillary Clinton how he was so and he hated he blamed her for all the revolution stuff going on during the um you know the\nEarly ... thousands there and all those countries yes\nAll of the revolution she was claiming her and that there was a scene in which John McCain and um [noise] uh what was his name from Connecticut um Lieberman when they were over that they were in some kind of um UN type\nAnd who was giving them this look you know and McCain was being interviewed in that movie and he said that even he said he was just ... he'll never forget it\nBut it's actually does it talks and talks about the money and how the Russian Mob needed to launder the money and how they needed\nTo find a sort of ... to help them launder it and they talk about Trump Tower as being a place where a lot of that got done I don't know if it's true and I but that's what they talk about and would you say it's a credible a documentary seems credible to me\nHe's gone oh okay\nWell Seventy of easy six one Seventy five or ten thirty it's only a minute until the news so I'll Wait and will continue six one Seventy five or ten thirty open lines this is very compelling staff but there is that there are other things to talk about and\n\nSomething pops up in a life and you want to share
