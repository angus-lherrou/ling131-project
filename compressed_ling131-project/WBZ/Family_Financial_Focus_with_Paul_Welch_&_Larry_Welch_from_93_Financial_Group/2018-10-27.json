the front line I think it's great that when we come together on a Saturday Night we can kind of go through what's been happening in the financial world in the market this week when we take a look at it and\nThen very boring oxygen\nVolatility is not going on in the mid term elections coming in God but I think the big question\nIs when people hear these snippets of news and little pieces of information what we really want to ask is well what does that mean for me you\nKnow what how was that actually affecting me right and I think we can answer that if we get you more um educated and have you have a better understanding of what you own why you own it once you know that then you'll know how it's affecting\nIt right does that make sense and how to affect the different economic cycles and yeah stock market cycles I well lecturing cycles I yeah I go through and we are really one world now some of the stuff\nThat I was listening to this week of that is all the global impact to hear what's going on in Saudi Arabia but you don't realize that\nThe Saudi money is money that goes to start ups in Silicon valley like we're such a one world world's running low and so what is happening around\nThe world as if the items that will come items that happen worldwide internationally can have an effect on our own US stock market has so that's\nUm you know that she realized and it's it's a situation that you know when you invest in the stock market you always have to invest it a long term mhm it's a long term objective is on short term cause any short term\nRewards you receive from the stock market can be taken away also on the short term yeah basis so it always has to be long term and there are so many items in that stock market that could affect a down would turn are positive turn mhm so you know in these last couple of weeks to market has been very\nVolatile there's no way around it but if you invested in in the market for the last two weeks of being one unhappy camper fly right right but you don't invest in my\nOf weeks you invest in the stock market over the next five years is always a long term objective that's why it's so important that you understand\nWhen you're allocating money in what positions you have that money in and way allocating that when they can't be a hundred percent in stock unless you're a you know thirty five forty years old his retirement money could have such a long term objective\nIf you are sixty years old or sixty five our retirement is you know facing you now within the next several years and years\nBut we have to take a hard look of how your allocating your money you don't want to be a hundred percent and start the objective has changed you have created wealth during your career\nTo um be able to maintain financial independence and you every time it so when you're getting close to retirement and at retirement it's no longer I got to create wealth it's I have to sustain this wealth I have to I have to sustain financial independence so the way that they are portfolio should look like you should have some in stock and our opinion\nBut it's the the objective now is to um keep up with inflation for long term growth on that stock they also have\nA portion of money in bonds which produce income and it's a good defense against it down would turn the stock market and you're you also have some money impress well protected accounts that thought affected by the movements of either the stocks and bonds\n... you know I Know I was just going to say that is one of those\nI was thinking when you said you might not be a happy camper now if you're just getting into the market right now five years from now you might be very happy if you're just starting they invest\nI Will get back in the election when Trump was elected you know many thought the market was gonna you know catapult go way down but\nIt didn't do that it it just rise and then it rise and then it rise and all the way up to the beginning\nOf this year and I was in an Eighteen so there was a lot of growth from the election all the way up to the beginning of the year two thousand Eighteen and it's interesting that we had you know we had volatile time in in January and February and then the market came back again mhm and we're almost at an all time high again so but now we're basically flat for the year\nAnd the stocks and so you say a self gee you know I had those games in two thousand Eighteen they seemed like they've been wiped out\nHere we are another volatile time but don't forget from the election up until the beginning of this year you have some tremendous growth in your portfolio so well really that the market isn't going to have some very good gains mhm in the last quarter of this year that could really happen\nBut if you make irrational decisions and say oh the markets real ball to right now I'm gonna take you know somebody out of that market you're gonna miss those games in those games are are going to happen so that's why it's so difficult\nTo invest with short term objectives you buy it market time you have to have that you know you have to understand a jury you're investing in stocks for a five year horizon\nBut ... it's been going up sending leave for a decade now correct basically\nSince the um you know the big correction back in two thousand two thousand nine but since March of ... the bottom of the market back in the um you know the mortgage crisis mighty it's been a very strong\nEconomic ... much a decade yeah but um you know what we say and people say all the time as\nUm you know costs right now with the volatility but just say as of January this year before there's been you know last year was very boring it was a good boring when the market because basically\nAll the industry is just kind of went up every month since well months yeah usually you never see that but um everybody is always happy when things are going in the right direction but they're never satisfied my right right what's gonna happen next there's always something on the horizon\nAnd uh you know this year here there's been volatility both in the equities um portion of the market in the fixed income the bond portion goes with equities just volatility with\nUm you know just the different indices and with everything going on with terrorists in the mid term elections coming up and also with fixed income\nAnd also related to some equities volatility is um [noise] with the rise in interest rates and interest rates going up with the fed raising interest rates in the ten year treasury over three percent or that causes um decline and market value and bonds and bond funds and also it can cause of volatility with equities ... 'cause I'm\nI'm investors may be saying well why am I taking risk with equity to get a\nTwo or three percent dividend if I can buy a ten year treasury with a three percent of it in a while so there's a lot of different things going on right now and then what the terrorists and um [noise] the uh you know like we said the whole global economy it's do you look at international that's down quite a bit this year [noise] so\nWhat we say you want to stay with your long term objectives you among from allocation in our opinion is diversification have a little bit of everything and it's just a pattern as a matter of what the waiting so much inequities how much and fixed income\nUm but don't you at all in our all out and don't just look you know back in like short term history like if you looked at international last December international do great ... double digit returns but if you say oh well there's going to put more international and all of this year international is way down\nAnd you might be saying oh I should get out of international right now because it's down ... we we said just the opposite you know when things have done well we're going to stay with that Johnny but we're going to trim some of the game you know when the international is up you know Trump some of the games and right now we're international is down we're not going to get\nA lot of it you know actually what we're going to do was maybe add to the ... the international while it's down\nBy old enough now how are you know that I Know that's what they said Riley balancing\nSo what we do with our clients as we stay with their long term allocation but we address these market cycles by doing the rebalancing right\nAnd this is really did um thought of as his kind of a conservative approach to right whether or not doing any kind of crap when I get it all in or all out or\nChange an hour waiting squeamish staying with the long term but addressing the cycles\nAre I Will be back right after this\n[noise] news

with these important questions call Lawrence Welsh and Paul Welsh principles of Ninety three financial group and hopes ... family financial focus heard Saturday at six PM on WB Z\nGeez I you know I I really like to have some help with this and they come in to see us and we would say\nOh you know if you want our hands on advice in Iraq to management we can open up an IRA and we use Charles Schwab as the custodian\nSo we would open up a child Schwab IRA from them ... and say this four hundred and twenty five thousand in there\nYou could roll over say four hundred thousand and then we would set up a you know what can a portfolio according to their objectives of well diversified you know strategic portfolio we'd be actively managing that and again uh you know depending on what their objectives are and how much to have um [noise]\nYou know in equities in principle protected and bonds um so now the majority of your money you can say well now I have some hands on help with that ... the four hundred thousand the twenty five thousand remaining\n... and your future contributions still stay at the employer plan so like I said we would also give our asset allocation suggestions for what's remaining and you knew contribution and we kind of look at it as a strategy hey if we'd be coming more conservative with the big amount of four hundred thousand\nThat remaining twenty five thousand in your future contributions you can be more aggressive with ... because you're adding every pay period and if the if the market went down you know you only have twenty five thousand going down not four hundred and twenty five thousand my aunt or new contributions you're buying a discount so there's like a whole strategy behind that\nSo that's you know that's an idea that you know we do help people with but just because you can roll over your ... doesn't mean you should we do a lot of analysis on that\nLeaving us with a cliffhanger now you got to figure out why we'll be back right after this\n[noise] do you have a question you would like tall or Larry to answer the call them during the week at eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three or four Ninety three financial group

details um Garofalo POW busy news radio ten thirty\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAre you ready for retirement [noise] find answers here on family financial focus with Paul and Larry well shit [noise] here's your host shown AC on it\nAnd we're back with family financial focus here I mean the ... here with us ... here and now Paul left us on the little cliffhanger earlier kind of a talking about the fact that most people we do get that the concept that\nYou know Twenty years ago it was like okay no more tensions no more uh you know different ways of having government being able to step in a big companies are taking care of you for the rest of your life you you know you work for a company get a pension you're done\nBy the companies now freeze their pensions or they don't ... them all done away with them entirely for you know the newer employee\nYeah and so ... but we did get the message that\nContribute everything you can see her four oh one K. that will be your retirement but you kind of left us on a cliffhanger pong going you know what do you do when you're fifty nine and a half I mean when you can roll it over into an individual retirement plan or why would you keep it in why would you not keep it in\nA while yeah I mean it's all according to your objective so I mean inside the four one K. there's usually you know an array of different investment choices and some of them are what they call target date funds which is kind of the simple way of allocating I don't always agree is the most beneficial but hey I'm retiring in\nTen years so you look ten years from now and you you invest in their twenty thirty five on the twenty forty fund so\nUm [noise] but if you um but then also there'll be a whole array of other investment choices um you know I'm ... and mid cap and international and some as active funds that have a higher\nExpense ratio and some index ... so I mean you are\nIf you kind of our do it yourself investor and you spend that time in ... and the different positions inside the four one K. and feel that you are confident in um continue on managing that\nThen in that there's some low cost investment choices some index funds and there you might say I'm just going to leave it there but if you're on the other end saying first of all I don't like all the investment choices there plus I don't have the confidence in myself and investing and there's really no help as far as active management in the fall when Kay\nSo I'm looking for some hands on help and that's when you would you know in a ... like a with a forum like ours you might say well I'll roll over a portion of it to the IRA where I Know that you know a forum can actually manage it for me and I don't have to spend the time or spend the worrying about it\nLike we have people that come in our office you know every now and then\nAnd they just reach the age of fifty nine and a half and they say okay I'm On a roll over my four oh one K. [laughter] and I write because they've been dissatisfied with the positions that are available in the four oh one K. and any ... for the most part\nIs going to have limited investment choices most give you know somewhere between twenty and thirty\nDifferent choices sometimes more or that you can allocate your money too but if you roll it over into your own individual IRA you're going to have you know thousands of choices and we can actually allocate that money\nSo some people who like in this question here they're dissatisfied with the new custodian as some insurance company they said and who knows what the actual\nPositions available for them to allocate the money ... and but you know whatever they are believing that it's not enough for what they're trying to accomplish with their money and we find that to be true sometimes so\nThe idea is you know roll over into your own individual IRA and then you can allocate many different areas and maybe more appropriately then you came with staying in the ...\nUm but there has to be a conversation that has to be you know understanding of what\nWhat's available in the foreign Kay first before you roll it over because sometimes people are just unaware that hey you know what it might make sense just to keep it in that for all and K\nMy right All right okay and so when you have the option say somebody does rolling into or a portion of it into an individual retirement account um than you are responsible for how your allocating your money unless you're working with professionals like yeah\nI mean you could you could just roll it over into an an IRA at any form you want a brokerage firm and manager just self just like you were kind of doing in the fall when Kay mhm I'm In like Larry mentioned you know when you roll it over to your own IRA and a brokerage firm like fidelity a swab or any place\nUm you know you can invest in anything you want individual stocks individual bonds mutual funds exchange traded funds basically you have the whole world of investing\nBut most people listening to us right now so I I Can't even figure out what funds inside the former cash I when I got an old roll it into an IRA and they have thousands of individual choices so most of the people coming into the U.S are not Raleigh Raleigh get over to an IRA because they want\nA more choices most of them are rolling it over to an irate because they want our help right and they want to have some protection from the downside I Want to have a strategic diversified portfolio they want to know somebody's actually managing the money addressing the market cycles is doing the rebalancing and that's what we do for our clients you know if you're listening for the first time this evening you might as well how do we do all that\nBut we are are in investment adviser for him here at the Ninety three financial group in investment advisor it doesn't mean any level of skill a training it's it's a license but you know we are when are you want to go to somebody that's been experiments we've been doing this many years but as an advisor\nWe advise worth the base advisors what that means is we actually manage our clients portfolio but we use no commission no low mutual funds and exchange traded funds but we don't hold the money we keep we use a custodian or the street name as a brokerage we use Charles Schwab\nSo if you decide to have us help you you open up a couch while we do it right at our office ... our opinion have the best of both worlds because\nYour your money's worth the big for 'em you have the comfort of knowing you know the big from Charles Schwab you get your statements from Schwab you get your uh um\nYou can go on Schwab dot com and look at your account even on your phone now but yet you have the hands on help with us ah actually managing the account so we're deciding you know how to allocate and how to protect from some you know market volatility and went to rebalance of different positions are up or down\nFor the following years income that's a great use of that extra growth\nBut if you're in your first year retirement and the first thing that happens in the equities you're expecting eight percent and it goes down five percent that's like I wasn't expecting that to him now what does that do to my entire my entire financial independence and all that ...\nBut when you invest you have to ... you have to understand that could happen\nSo that's why you don't have too high percentage inequities go even if the stock market goes down the equities\nThey still a lot of the equities we have in our class portfolios pay a lot of dividends those companies so you can you can certainly use some of the dividends for income but you don't want to be taking money from your equities for next year's income if the equities or down so that's why you have money and bonds and money and prints were protected account so you have sources of where to take that income from\nOn an annual basis as one of the things that we go over with our clients\nRight I was gonna say and like that has to all be very understood and strategize ten people need to know\nHow this is accumulating for my income and then Paul you were mentioning that\nWhen you're managing somebody's life savings I'm you know you do it it's a service but it's a one percent the on the overall investment but some people are like well why would I pay one percent can I get something cheaper\nWell that's what I'm saying you have to find value in the service just like anything else in life you know it's like if you need to uh\nRewire your your house well could I Do it myself or as a value to hire a professional electrician right right I think it's it's a value so you know electric cars yourself or to the same thing with um anything else in life but it's you know with your investments\nUm if you have it in a four one K. like we talked about you know before the last breaking it well I don't like the investment choices there I'm not confident and doing this on my own I Would like some professional help mhm\nAnd uh you know when you go to a professional in the financial industry is basically fee based on commission based do one way or the other you going to be\nPaying somebody something right um so as a fee based advisor we just fine it's it's a it's a we feel it costs we feel it's a better way to work because that's how we do it um but yeah you are paying out one percent fee\nBut hopefully you'll find value that hopefully we can say we're going to do any better but we're going to work hard for you\nBut I'm the value is that you don't have to worry about it you you're hiring us to worry about it for you mhm and um you get into professional guidance and\nAnd um you know that is being actively managed\nAnd the other thing is wherever your money is right now ... whether it's in a four one K. are you having another I raise our brokerage accounts of mutual funds or annuities\nThere's always some type of a um expense ratio or a commission or something you're paying ... but yet you know nobody may even be managing that so we can also do an analysis on your current investments to show you what you're currently paying\nAnd you may maybe pay more than one percent are not even know it but you might buy a pay a little bit more with the service like ours or you might pay about the same but it's all a matter of finding the value when you understand the relationship\nThat all we want you to do is do better\nThan I think you know that's a great way to work\nRight and I was just going to say like when you do have a couple of weeks like this when you're seeing the volatility in the market\nAnd you're going oh I I've been doing this on my own for I don't know if I'm doing the right thing I don't want to have that full responsibility on me I'm really never been in the financial world I'm a teacher or a college professor identity asked you know this is a different world for me um\nWell that's why people say though that I hear you say rebalancing Paul and I don't even know how I supposed to be invested right to begin with right away I Know when to rebalance sly and it's very intimidating doing doing it on your own I mean that's why most people don't do anything right kind of shell shocked\nFor I think the active management has um a lot to do with it too because our clients they know they come in like many classroom once or twice a year for review meetings and in those review meanings we're going we're still asking questions you know anything changed in\nYour life what's going on and sometimes it gives a different direction on how actually manage the money\nBut in those meetings we can give you know the his ... the historical performance of their accounts and how the performance has been signed inception so you know someone's been quiet for the last eight nine ten years whatever it might be there's a graph to show him this is where you began\nThis is how much money you invested in this where you are today ... and you've got an average annual return or whatever it might be\nAnd so it's very easy to fall that type of performance and\nYou would think you should be able

break Joni you know when people come in for you is that in our clients for many years and you know with showing them the actual performance they received\nSince day one is to see that and even though you know this year it might not look as positive as previous years but then you look at the average annual returned they've been receiving for the last five seven eight nine years whatever it is ...\nAnd even though this year has been lower it the average return because if you know I said of the clients eight years ago if I said you would average this much would you uh\nBeen happy with that you know see my way so you have to understand everything doesn't always go in one direction mhm unless you want to put in the bank and settle for one or two percent might um but it's all a matter of um you know what your objectives are and understand there's going to be ups and downs anyone can for the long term\nLong term I'm growth rate and knowing that we don't just sit and look at it oh it's up that's good well what's down that's too bad we address that by the rebalancing and change an hour waiting and looking what our clients need whether they're still accumulating or if they're taking out monthly income\nWhen they're withdrawing monthly income where we balance in and and feeding that income from you know whatever we feel is the ... when the best at that time\nIt really is a very personalized relationship oh it absolutely is and it and everybody is set up to meet their own any day now working for them yeah yeah it's terrible if people are just in the cookie cutter here's the deal here sixty All right we'll be back with more coming up after the news [noise] [noise]\nHello Paul and Larry well send the Ninety three financial group and host of family financial focus hurts Saturday evening to expand here on W. levy\nLet's take a moment and talk about for one k.'s and retirement planning\nPaul the traditional pension plans offered by employers are becoming something of the past many now just off a four one K. is putting more responsibility on the employees to secure their financial future\nThat's right Larry some funding to remember that far when Kay accounts may be the main source of income during your retirement years\nThat's why many are saying I really need to pay attention this time I only have a few years left before I retire\nAnd it would be easy if we're all productive in our careers ... and we have participated in the economy and we raise kids and we helped out we gave to charities and then when you're ... sixty five the government gives you a check for ten million dollars that say good job yeah\nThat's how I Would say so easy I Know they have that ten million to last for the rest of your life\nThen what do you do with the ten million I always a question like that now we are doing all those things and then still we have to you know plan for our own retirement and invest our money wisely drives what we're going to need to maintain that financial independence\nAnd we just kinda got that we're not that long ago was like oh and by the way did you you didn't get the note is that you are in charge of your own retirement oh I'm Sorry we didn't really put that out so that's another ... into our culture don't you feel like it wasn't like a big hey there we change this law now\nIt was it just kept seeping in and I mean I can tell you over the years just conversations with friends\nThat thought that they were working for a company because of this particular pension that they were offering only to find out ten years after working there they're like yeah they changed all that and then it really the it's all on\nWhat we say it all the time they don't know the previous generations Larry and you know my own parents I mean what father worked for the same corporation for forty years or so and when he retired he received a Social Security and his pension with a survivor benefits so our parents' income didn't change much after he retired than before he retired\nI'm you know that's a good thing in a bad thing I mean the good thing is they didn't really have to worry about their income they know exactly what was going to come in and then when my father passed away to survive a benefit you know for a mother where she received the grade of the to Social Security which was a fathers and she had to survive a benefit for the pension\nSo um she was still OK mhm um so the good thing is that wasn't a lot of 'em responsibility for them as far as what to do with the financial world how to invest money because it was pretty much the pension and Social Security like the bad thing is there was no\nUm grade our financial independence for them on as far as any flexibility in other words they had to live on that set income ... it was I'm like hey I have\nA sir I saved a certain amount of money and I can invest this I Know it's my responsibility or I can get some professional help\nBut uh maybe I can spend more money one year maybe I can spend less money more one year maybe I can withdraw some money to get to my children um whereas when you get a set pension and said Social Security uh basically live on that set income mhm so in today's world\nUh most of us are not going to receive the pensions you know most of us it will we be Social Security and his whatever we saved in our retirement accounts that's why I said all the time here on the radio or new people coming in is whatever you saved and your four one K. A. for all three beef for fifty seven IRAs whatever it might be\nYour total all that up when you retire that's your pension mhm and um\n[noise] in one way you can say oh I'd rather just you know I Wish I just had a pension but in another way it's I think a benefit because it provides\nIt's more flexibility whatever you saved\nIf you invest that wisely either on your own or with professional help you can produce the same income that you might have received for a pension but if you do a good job either on your own or with professional help\nYou can have more flexibility of need more money one year you can take it out if you don't need as much you can let it grow you give money to your children you can do whatever you want\nAnd if you do a real good job either with you on your own or with professional how\nYou can produce the same income you're could receive with the pension but he may be able to also leave more money to your loved ones filed it'll be something up you know what the pension and Social Security\nUm once you pass away and if this was five a benefit for your spouse she or he passes away that's it no more no nothing left for the family right where I go I'm In my opinion in one way it's it could be a much better thing\nThe but at the responsibility is all on you that's why you know younger people say save as much as you can and as you get close to retirement are at retirement invest wisely to produce the income you need but also um you know to not have too much risk not to be too conservative\nBecause the other thing we say quite a bit is you know with our parents receive and got pension wasn't some kind of magic wand where every month of checked just turned up in the mailbox such what you know our parents are with the pension right\nBut you know my father that worked at a huge corporation you know there was a pension fund with pension managers with millions are more\nIn um investments that the pension fund managers manage that money to produce the income for all the pension fund participants and still grow the money without too much risk right so basically your own four one K. that is your pension fund is up to you as your own pension fund manager\nTo invest it wisely and if you feel that you don't have the I'm confident and doing it on your own or you don't have the ambition or you don't want to spend the time the new hire your own pension fund manager will emotional like us\nRight where I read I think you know back in those type of days when Paul and I were growing up and we grew up in a suburb we grow up in ... ... um and so you know I remember as a kid my father talking to other fathers and the neighborhood of get-togethers are given whatever it might be in\nThat people would choose their careers based on some of the nation they were gonna yeah you know be within in a lot of that was about the pension mhm and what is the pension I'm going to receive how many years of service or I have a base\nYou know where the where they are employed with the benefits of that company and most of it was what is the pension right you know and today you don't hear that too much or too often any more than ... you know and we you know we grew up at a\nSmall ranch home and it was my my mom and dad race seven kids in that small ranch hill right right but it was never a way you know my father wasn't able to put away lots of money for retirement but he always had that security of knowing\nSome data retires he has a pension and ... but it could have been different he could uh you know he could have put money away in a four one K. and not have the pension and that could have been more advantageous\nAnd better results than having a pension itself my so the idea is is more opportunity out there now than ever has been before and the financial world it's just you as the investor the consumer the employee needs to take advantage of it and and not to be passive about it but I understand\nYou know what benefits are out there for me and and and things could work much better there's much more opportunity now an investment world than there ever has been before so you look at it\nYou know not as so to speak of a downer you look at it as a positive say hey you know what I write is money right before I K\nRather than maybe making less money or wherever it might be having the company had felt take money on my paycheck to put it in this pension fund that's got to produce X amount of money I can do better by myself\nRight or well just working with somebody that knows how to manage\nMoney in order to create your own ranch and that's really what we're talking about correct I mean you know who you are saying it seemed like some obscure thing like there was just some big bucket of money somewhere that goes and when you retire we're going to just take this from this pension ... but that whole pension fund\nWas managed using a lot of the same similar\nUm approaches that you already doing visual aid for our clients ... oh okay\nThere was a company that we're putting money away and the pension might imply nights company you're saying you know many companies participate and they are in the ... you know ... and you\nKnow as the um employee\nYou're taking that money that otherwise I went to a pension is going into the four oh one K. or the employer match yeah ... ... I mean you're going to look at it that we look at it as a positive mhm um but there are still some who get very good pensions so you know our next door neighbor grown up with a police officer you had a great pension now so\nIt does life every day Roy ... right right so the yeah those are the tradeoffs but I think people even just start\nTo really wrap their heads around okay my I keep saying my retirement fund our my four oh one K. think of that as your\nHeritage your pet is you're going to be a bench and it's a matter of you know how how good you were at contributing and saving and then how good you will be or if you get some professional help on allocating and producing the income\nRight now with finances isn't your thing it might have held out there this help will be back right after this [noise]\n\nHere's an important question what do you want out of your investments gross income or maybe it's just it didn't serve\nYou currently have stages in your life changed since you do your investments are you asking yourself it's not\nHow much I earned but how much I keep or maybe you're okay with the ups and downs of the market and more interested in that big number and the\nFuture remember it's not what investments you own but why you own them has your advisor been meeting with you on a regular basis or do you even have any one helping you with these important decisions if not come Ninety three financial group at eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three for ... for a free\nAnalysis of your current investments to help you decide\nIf they're still right for you call an eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three four principles of Ninety three financial group Lawrence Welsh and Paul well she can be heard as host of family financial focus Saturday\nNight just sit here on WB the Ninety three financial group eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three for for more information including their disclosures at Ninety three F.

Paul and Larry once you're here Ninety three financial group [laughter]\nI'm just I was kind of glancing over a little article you know I I work things out sometimes when I come here because I'm like oh we noticed over this you know we should go right but I and I know we've gone over before but it was it was kind of interesting that\nUm in money magazine they had a a little thing just on interpreting\nWhat Wall Street talk is all about and how expansive all these terms are and how different every planner adviser this one gets ... and it's like okay no wonder everybody is a bit overwhelmed when\nThere's a lot to do when how understand I understand and I'm\nYou know as I was reading this but also listening to you and you were before Paul going we try to make it simple we just make it really simple I think people can understand simple and I'm going you know what that is\nPretty well you look at how we work in the investment advisory it's it's it is one sentence comment is how we were we we managed your portfolio of all want to censor the very simple to understand the end yeah but I mean in\nThat yeah I Know people sometimes it brings out the wrong perception of what that might be right like we just explain there or you know everyone does every ... every advise every planet every broker shows they do what they feel is best and we know there are\nA investor advisers that have wetter skills where just one percent from zero dollars all the way up\nBut there are other investment advisers where they're charging much are they charged two percent not one percent two percent almost double yeah [laughter]\n... trooper said I don't know what it actually is from zero dollars at two hundred thousand that goes to one point seven five and two hundred three hundred and one more in five ... three hundred five hundred thousand different scales depending on your eyes remain\nJew us it's like well I mean that is due to present\nIt even if you invest over a million then there's still charging the two percent for the first couple of hundred thousand dollars right but they it's perfectly fine and but I Would say is that consumer than I Hope that I get two percent greater growth [laughter] to better no guarantee that everyone I just do the best that they can do\nBut whether you have an investment adviser and you're paying you will feel like with our from rich it's one percent a year we feel it's very um fair\nAnd for the work that we do for our clients we don't feel were overcharging anyone you know we hope no one ever feels like that one of our clients but wherever you have your money invested like we said before right someone just like you say Wall Street zones and making it in the wall street is not a charity yeah right and so in order to where you have money invested he learned that from me [laughter]\nLike everything else right yeah so but where you have any money invested there is some type of fees\nThat go along with it ... no one in investment world doing anything for free right so I don't mean to I just got finished ahead in every area of the investment world mhm and if you think about it\nUm there there's there's probably you know ... main areas so there are equities and then there are bonds and then there are a principal protected account so when you say\nDifferent types of a couch they can protect their principal what what one is really identifying most times is a some type of fixed annuity mhm\nSo if you you know just mentioning the word annuities\nMany investors run the other way right because they hear bad things about annuities and they're correct there's a lot of bad things about a lot of annuities out there and\nThere and I see commercials all the time and you need to ... do you know within the next commercial is never buying annuities which one do you believe exactly\nWhat I'm trying to explain is that there is a good the bad and the ugly mhm in annuities and there are some good in my opinion there are some good annuities out there\nThere are some some bad annuities out there and there are some fair annuities and out of there but you have to do research to try to find the best ones my but most consumers they don't have time to do the research I don't know how to do research and\nYou know what questions do I have to us to find out what show the good ones\nThat's the same and mutual fund some mutual funds are more expensive to own than others\nAnd you could say the same thing there is a good the bad and the ugly ... why would you have a mutual fund who's expense ratio was would say one point two five person when one of his peers expense ratio was you know point five percent mind and if you do your research and find out the historical returns of basically in the same ballpark and why are you paying point seven five percent more annually\nAnd just mentioning express ratios many investors don't even understand what that is but that's the internal expenses of owning different types of mutual funds are index funds or\nEven HGF is what is it really costing me\nMost investors are 'cause it's not in their statement they don't really know it's a perspective when they first and best invested in that position position\nOne thing I learned as every every investor reached their perspective is from page one out there is not under that come in and say I read this whole thing though I don't see this is why I I don't even think the people that I write those perspectives has read them but I Know this is I've never met anyone\nWho was a perspective prospectus writer\n... with the ... practices they give out today it's such a ... paper yeah you wonder how when they print it that it just doesn't fall apart it's amazing\nKnow what I'm Talking about um doing the things that come in the mail in a big envelope and then it's like\nSome something that you own and it's a really thin little paper and you just go off and you throw it in the trash because you know you're never going to read it you know recycling the recycling and that's what I meant but one of the things that and again we're we're all about making sure that your informed to ask the right questions\nUnderstanding that\nThere's some reason why they like to keep this whole industry less than very knowledgeable for the average person for the ... for not even the average print just the person that is out there doing a different career than the financial world and so when I was looking through some of these things\nAnd even when we're talking about what should you be looking for in your adviser and then I'm reading all these things and I'm like oh Paul Larry don't do any of that you know I mean when they're saying recommendations and you're saying I it says it may take a few phone calls to find the pro\nUm and one of the reasons why you want to find or they're saying compensation to minimize conflicts of interest save a plan or is the only meaning he or she is paid just by you not also by third parties such as a fund company\nUm so this is what a fee based company or ... when I go or they are acting out from a", "show_name": "Family Financial Focus with Paul Welch &
