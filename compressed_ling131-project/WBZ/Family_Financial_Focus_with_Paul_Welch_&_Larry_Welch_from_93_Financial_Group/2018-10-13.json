D. too meant for an eye heart radio station\nThe way we manage our my right that they're in and I think as you know a perplexed um\nSituation for many people because they're unsure which way to go with my ... right and we see people you know every day the ... and we know that that's true it depends what part of their life to Iran that some people like you just mentioned Jody I don't know what their ages are but if you're approaching that age where you want to start saving for a house you must be younger\nRight I mean they just got married they be you know and they're like okay we're gonna yeah now see I didn't do all the next thing that you're supposed to do after you get married is now okay we're thinking about getting a house and so you know the and today we're talking about it's like just an average house ... like just an average house how does a young person\nAfford the mortgage we're not talking a mansion but the prices of housing\nFor the ... the father and their grandmother brands [laughter] so what we want to buy a house you got any money\nOn that yet I come to your aunt\nAt a stage of life while you're young and you're trying to accumulate wealth right for a down payment or purchase of um a property yeah so that allocation would be quite a bit different with just say than an allocation for people who are sixty years old they want to retire when they're sixty three right right totally different and then\nThose same people that you're talking about Joni\nYou know they also have to look at it is a long way away but which will be doing as far as putting away for our own retire time and right and many people find themselves that you know age thirty five forty five and\nThey're looking at that and say maybe I should be putting more away yeah if I'm putting more away how should I allocate the money at age ... which is quite a bit different than someone who's fifty five and looking at retirement you know a decade away ten years\nThey have a different allocation than someone who's forty five when your body five you're looking for wealth you looking to obtain wealth grow your accounts and hopefully achieved that wealth southern Iraq fifty five or sixty you have a nice nesting set aside for retirement\nUm so but when you get to those ages at age fifty five and six day then you're looking at well it's not so much more about gaining that wealth anymore if you've done a pretty good job and have somebody put away and the next day\nIt's more about wish wish I'd be today if I'm gonna retire in five years which I allocate which my investments look quite live up until that time every time and and what should I look like at retirement and the goal is ...\nTo create wealth for retirement the goal is to sustain financial independence now in through our retirement\nMhm well and then the question is and how do you do that when you're younger it's like All right how much can you live on and max out that for a one K. or your for all three baby or ... whatever you can into that ... you know and well and they are a challenge\nWhether it's you know most people that come into the U.S are getting close to retirement so it's more about conserving what they have but also growing it and providing income in the future is so it's all a matter what the objectives are you of your money is for like you know for younger people\nFor retirement money it's the eighth wonder of the world has the power of compounding but that's a long term money um I'll give you an example of that there's the uh one of my clients come in for a review when we were discussing his daughter um but before I get into that if you're saving for a home\nWithin the next year or two it you're not really looking for growth you already need the money so you're looking for access so anything you're going to use within the next year or two Joni it's not how much broke you get it just making sure it's there it's liquid and it said that would be bank savings okay um [noise] but if it's a difference\nBetween banks savings and a money market [noise] nothing [laughter] Hi I'm not\nAn allergy ... somewhat technically it's\nDifferent I don't know what I'm you know most money market accounts that you receive also um you know have protection and some of them half\nMaybe even FDIC or other insurance but a money market is basically a savings account and um and then of course regular banks savings and I you know we usually we open up a brokerage account is money market savings and there's different money market in the broke would you can go into a but based on the it's all just savings which means it's liquid in a safe and of course you know a regular bank savings\nI mean you could buy like a one year CD if you're going to use the money you know a little after a year\nBut you know for for money you need within the next several years the next couple of years it's not really growth you don't want to risk it might not because all I might get eight percent but you might lose eight percent my um but anything over that especially for retirement money then you know you're looking for ultimate growth\nIn the market goes down it's like who cares I don't need it now my man if you're adding every pay period are every month or so you're actually buying more shares so\nAs you young it doesn't really matter heavily and so um the reason I just just brought to mind exist last week or two weeks ago um clients came in for a review when in their daughter\nOr just changed careers and she's only thirty and she did a good job in the previous employer fall McKay she saved forty thousand dollars a laugh and I think it was raw wood yeah right our younger people to do a raw\nSo that means that forty thousand now she won't be adding to that anymore because that's a previous employer form and care costs she\nI'm not if I mean she will I'm sure get a new job and she can start a new employer four one K. but you know we were discussing that and saying well now she can roll that over to our own\nIndividual Roth IRA and you know at age thirty she wants to just keep it all invested in the stock market she doesn't really need any\nBond she said I'm not going to use is she's thirty so maybe she won't use it for thirty five years until she sixty five or ... you know she can't really touched the growth until she's Fifteen and a half without a penalty she can always take out the contributions 'cause it's a rough [noise] but anyways I explain to them the old rule uh Seventy two\nNumber oh I Love this guy had hit me\nSo [laughter] the role of Seventy two it's a pure mathematical rule that does not telling you how to invest your money but\nIf you take Seventy two divided by the growth rate that's how long it takes money to double so you know if you look at a stock market over you know Thirty years probably average like ten percent a year because it's going to be good and bad years\nSo Seventy two divided by ten I mean basically money doubles and every every seven years wow you know if you earn seven percent than Seventy two divided by seven is every ten years six percentage every twelve years\nSo I explained to them that forty thousand dollars with the rule of Seventy two\nHow much do you think that money if she average is ten percent of yeah what do you think that it'll be worth when she's sixty don't make me do math Paul Go ahead you you have a calculator forty thousand dollars average in ten percent per year\nUm it at age sixty five will be one million two hundred and eighty thousand dollars with no contributions\nThat we're not on the back right after that\n[noise] news radio ten thirty and Ninety three financial group a perfect combination for the information you need to make a no obligation

forty thousand to a million to eighty I like I still blown away at the arms to\nUnbelievable but it's just pure mathematics is just math and but then you'll get a comment oh yeah but I'm thirty sixty five a million to eighty won't be worth anything\nI was gonna say yeah there\nBut it is worth more than not having it isn't\nIt is you know what if somebody tells my kids are so you know okay so you're thirty and this is what you're going to do and by the time you're sixty five you're going to have one point two million I think that kid would do that with that thorough with that forty\nGrand or talk to people you know upon I better this career for over twenty five years yeah you know we talked to clients Twenty years ago\nAnd they ever thought that they'd be worth over a million dollars today that was like insane that will never had of it yeah but now they're saying clients come in and the worst one point eight million whenever my age just just real estate alone my right Ryan Lee in any area in in this general Boston\nYou know area the real estate has gone up so much\nWell that's why a lotta times still today you know I'm young kids some of the trends are they don't care about buying a car they're fine without buying a car you know are owning a car but\nEveryone today is still like we know they've seen their parents homes increase in value right there like okay and they wanna a stable home and the staple investment real estate is still a pretty stable investment um especially now because the\nLetter for ... for young people to to get home though with the market\nSo crazy world you know and then it's inflation that you are talking about with that forty thousand grow dollars growing at one point two million and what does one point two million got to be worth ... years from now right it's not going to have the same value as a does today ... short ... you know because of inflation so\nThe reality that is that's the truth right to have the one point two million to not to have it\nTwenty years ago the house that you bought for two hundred grand that you look at it now and you're like wait it's what it's like what my little how you know is over five on your gun I I'm living in a half a million dollar house and you're sitting there going yeah you know thinking\nYeah but not not for people who are first time buyer right they don't realize now I just think that the average price today is five hundred seven hundred thousand dollars\nAnd how can a young couple today have I have enough of a\nDown have you know now they're talking about forty year mortgages are you able to afford the monthly payments and that's why you know it is smart\nAir income is more than the incomes right people ... and I so it's all relative is just on my wedding that inflation is inflation but what I Want to be a that's important for retirees to understand well even inflation\nOr as you know I again if you'd maybe just listening to your left turn on the radio by saying\nJust a pure madam mathematical rule if you take your growth rate divided by Seventy two that's how long it takes you money to double so if you average ten percent a year so you have money invested a hundred percent in stocks I mean that can happen I'm not saying you're going to get right right right but at age thirty if you have forty thousand dollars\nAnd you average temperature than a year and your money doubles every seven years by age sixty five that forty thousand is now a million two weighty seem crazy but you can just\nDo the math right right right um [noise] but then the question is how much would that be worth you know it's not going to be worth anything when I'm sixty five with inflation but it just just I'm just one quick math on my head say inflation is three percent a year\nSo you might knock off one third of that but ... million to waiting might be worth you know ... inflation adjusted maybe I don't know seven hundred stole a lot of money [laughter] so um [noise] anyway so by just before the break you know you ask and you know what what would the average stock market doing a ten year period and you know if you look at any\nIndices over different ten year periods or you know a long term an average it out you know in any ten years you know the ah\nThe market could do seven to ten percent of the ten year period but then you talk to individual investors and they've only average three percent\nAnd there's been studies on this um you know a certain mutual fund might average eight percent per year and then you talk to the shareholders of mutual fund and they only average three percent per year it makes no sense right yeah but the reason is\nIs people get in and out of the market that sticking with it you know instead of sticking with that investment or staying in the market\nOver you know ten or Twenty years or Thirty years like I said life gets in a way although I had this forty thousand but then eight years later I had to withdraw ten or or I got nervous when the market went down and I put it all in the bank and then I put it back in\n... I had to even pay the taxes on the scale of the stocks and ...\nWill get in and out of investments that giving up the overall long term return\nUm even if there's been different studies if you miss just like one or two of the largest um performing days out of the year it can drastically\nUm reduce your overall growth over the years a words there are some the market goes down fast Joni but it goes up fast right and if you miss like a you know one week the market could go up to a three percent in a week\nAnd if you missed that out if you missed out on that because you got out of the market because you were nervous because it went down ... then you you lose out on the upside potential so what we say is don't get all in a rollout stay with your long term objectives in address the market cycles\nRice but one of the other things that you know because I'm thinking that so if you've been in the market for the past forty years a hundred\nPercent you know you would say well I must have four times that but when we see all of a sudden that re correction or the big debt like we saw in two thousand seven two thousand eight if you had\nTwo hundred thousand in the stock market in one disastrous mold without the rebalancing and stuff you just took your two hundred and it dropped down to one sixty or one\nIssue with that is is this is where it gets scary is um whatever you lose you pretty much have to earn double just to get back to where you were so you have two hundred thousand\nAnd you add it all on stocks and like in say two thousand two thousand nine for example the stock market went down to fifty percent right now you're two hundred is one hundred\nSo now you lost half your money you would think oh I have to earn fifty percent to get back up to two hundred no when you lose fifty percent you now have to earn one hundred percent just to get back to where you were so I you know if you have two hundred now which one hundred\nThousand one hundred to get back to two hundred and ... to ... a hundred percent of a hundred thousand is so that's why we feel it is so important\nTo stay with the long term objectives but addressed the market cycles because if you look at it another way\nIf you had a diversified portfolio from like you know safe from any time period Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand eight and you were ... against us a mock it was going up so then when the market did go down you already had some of your profits off the table you didn't lose as much as if you just kept it all on stocks life so I'm well\nAnd that we refer to as Alan ... and that's what we do for our client\nOur opinion it's so important you know to go as you're going forward what your investment says to actively manage\nBut you really want to take care of your\nYourself for your own retirement and of course of a family business you want to help all your family members have their own kind of re timeline I write 'em then a lot of other things come in with family businesses um business continuity of something happens to the owner usually that's the blood of the business yeah do you have a plan if the owner um\nHas a has an accent and becomes disabled are unfortunate death\nUm if there's a partnership if something happens to one of the partners as like by cell agreements or the um\nThe remaining ... the um the other partner so you ... you know the ... to take care of his or her family\nBusiness continuity when you retire do you plan to pass on the business either tier\nYeah maybe a family member or you know to sell it or maybe some of the employees may want to purchase it so these are all things that we discuss and across the state planning and something happens to you do you have the trust work set up in cooperation with the business in real estate and everything else so I kind of the planning\nYou know business owners safe so to\nSpeak like the following [laughter] yeah yeah I Would sell the business 'cause they're at their age where they could retire I Would sell the business\nYou know and just and just you know\nTake the money and live off that money and everything would be fine\nBut I don't want to sell the business because I have my children working here I have my right you know my niece has my nephew is the family business like Paul explain is somewhat supporting\nFinancially other people on his own family right so the seller business right is I I Would but I'm not going to so we need we need to keep building this as I said ... and I need to be you know that the head person in the business and the the the question becomes at some point\nThere has to be a decision made ... and those are difficult decisions for business owners do I sustain this business so I keep going ... who's going to take the business over how's it going to run you know should I is selling the best thing for everybody are is selling the worst thing for everybody so it's not just them personally themselves\nWhat they're thinking about is their own family by you know and and what benefits is this is going to have this family going forward and and you know I'm looking at my own kids to work and they're all working harder obtaining an income at all yes good why would I Want to sell this is a good situation or another\nCommon situation that we run into was a ... you know say it's a family business mom and dad on the business and two of the sons of working in the business with them and their daughter was not so they're going to pass that business onto their two sons\nBut that's not fair to the daughter and the daughters should get some some equal value so there's ways of doing that way you you know if the\nOne or two children are ... are going to receive the business how do you balance that value well with other assets for the um child on the children that are not going to receive the business right so that's all part of you know the family planning the estate planning the business continuity planning\nSo there's a lot that goes into it and deal with all of that not just us we have a whole professional team a network you know attorneys that we can refer people to and all that\nRight well I think people just forget that it really needs to focus on the objective first what is your object in and that there was a plan and a strategy to meet that objective ... and if we can focus on map you know than than yourself that's the that's the plan will be back right after that\nLife is busy and your time is\nValuable ask yourself do you want to spend your free time enjoying your family for worrying about your investment why

Saturday Night to\nHere on WB Ninety three financial eight hundred nine zero eight nine ... for more information and feeling their disclosure is it Ninety three es gene dot com\nThe preceding broadcast has been a commercial presentation paid for by the Ninety three financial group family financial focus continues after the news [noise]\nW. V. the buses WXXI K. S. F. M. H. D. two men for an eye hard radio station\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio then thirty for the news was never a\nTime seven o'clock fifty degrees clear skies in Boston headed down to the thirties and most suburbs low forties downtown traffic and whether it together coming up I'm gone rogue who do BMW busy news\nOur top story at this hour senator lose Warren has the lead but she also has an opponent shoes campaigning hard nobody's he's carrying regal spoke with them on the stump\nThe right thing but um yeah I mean that's\nAll the way when it all I don't get the idea that I Know people have been in these situations\nIn the investment world given financial advice right and you know you could be as an arms embargo Joe\nBut uncle Joe needs to be careful and he knows it my you know so he might seek the advice of a professional in Missouri and buys a financial planner wherever it might be and I would be a prudent thing to do because once you start giving advice to someone\nYou should go and do this are invested in that I or all of a sudden you're the one who gave them that advice right\nSo that doesn't work out over the next few years I guess what I Know whether it's said or not said the person who gave the advice to he's going to be an inwardly thinking well you gave me ... gave me that advice uncle Joe it didn't work out right right right oh so if you if the situation is\nYou know I I Do I Need a you know get my car worked on he might say well go see this mechanic ... right now things are going to tell them how to fix the car right so that's you know a pretty simple situation but when it gets to\nUncle Joe you know how to invest for every time I'm going to retire in five years ... you're given specific investment advice you need to be careful with them because I mean I don't want it on you but all your money and\nGoogle you know I should work out pretty good maybe the right advice and it might work out fine but it may be the wrong advice lie and it doesn't work out so good but it was on hold Joe who gave the advice why so we all in a certain way need to understand that\nAnd whatever where the challenge it might be whether it's it's as if it's in the financial world is that in my opinion it's so involved today there are so much so to speak that Wall Street is offering and financial companies are are offering and brokerage houses that it is so much it's somewhat overwhelming it's ridiculously overwhelm aid for the person\nWho is not doing this Monday through friday as their ...\nSo in that in my opinion and that sort of challenging in a financial world you should seek out an adviser my someone that you trust someone that you know has has experienced at someone who understands a financial world and putting plans together ... specific plans\nSo um you know that I'm not ... well I guess in a way I'm not a health writer [laughter] I mean obviously we're in business with a lot of people to come in and see us I mean people do but you know whether it's office or anyone else you should see the the guidance\nOf a financial planner investment advisor that you've been proven yourself in interviewing you know a few of them I Do you find that when that you feel comfortable and you feel confident and you know that they have the experience to I'm not only do the analysis but to be you know ... assistant you as time goes on\nI I got an example of that and it's a lot of times when it comes to family\nHum people your turn to which usually a lot of times it's not all how should I invest by money it's a situation like oh my mother's ill and my father's worried about\nUm her enter in a nursing home and how do they protect the eyes and you know my dad was thinking of just transfer in the house to me\nThese types of questions and um that's where a homespun solution can really turned into a disaster oh just transfer the houses are your son's name you're going to leave it to him any ways and you don't understand the risk all of a sudden\nYou you're you put the sun's risk on that property what if he goes bankrupt or miles in business or goes bankrupt or gets divorced all these other things you know your property could be at risk or he takes on your\nCapital gains exposure rather than inheriting I'm just going over some right right right things that can happen\nSo a lot of times those are the types of family questions that come up but again if if you are the person that's receiving that question like Larry said\nHopefully you know enough not to give specific advice but to turn our guide them or refer them to a professional that would really ... you don't know the proper advice and I've example of that I you know I have clients that call me\nI'm for that situation and just last week one of my clients called me and not for himself and he said you know I have a friend that unfortunately\nHis um the friend's wife you know unfortunately is not doing well and they're concerned about what they call after protection if she enters a nursing home and how do they protect the assets and all of that [noise] so he knew a little bit but he knew enough\nNot to give specific advice so when my client called me I basically gave him some\nYou know some guidance while this would be the situation if ... if she enters a nursing home this is what he would want to do generally but it it you know the the real answer was I referred\nMy client to refer him to a elder law attorney and there's been planning attorney that I Know so you know by the friend go into my client on my client going to me and then me go into the attorney right that individual is going to get the proper advice hopefully\nRight right right yeah and and so many times and we're going to talk about this coming up is um what happens when you're in that situation where you are company is offering buyouts you know everyone ends up turning to each other going well what are you doing well what do you deal and did you do the lump sum or did you do the ...\nAnd without really having the proper sounding board a well this is my life this is what's going on in my family these are my objective people end up just doing what the person in the next cubicle as doing\nI mean I don't know what I'm doing you know but someone's yeah what you're talking about\nIs you have an employee that off as an early retirement package mind and that's why we you know we do planning for people's hair I plan on retiring in five years say their age six to I'm going to retire at sixty five but again to life gets underway and all of a sudden at age sixty three you get a notice\nHey we're often you this early retirement package so now it's like oh shit I retired two years earlier I should I take the package and I'll take the package and if you take the retirement package you know how should you take it to a lot of times it could be like a year a severance pay or\nThey add money to your pension plan or so there's all and then if you're under sixty five what about my health insurance into I receive Medicare so there's so much that goes into that but um you know we do all kinds of analysis for people that you know come in with that\nThat situation right and sometimes it's a blessing sometimes I go I wasn't really expecting this I don't know if I should take it or not um but you want to make a wise decision because it's one of the most important decisions you're making your life right so we are those\nAre the things that people give you the cookie cutter solutions\nThey go oh just do that yeah you're like oh I Won the lottery just do\nThat yeah we ... a Bible in my opinion everybody's different and you really want to do the proper analysis because it depends on you know what your budget is you know get married is your spouse still working is all kinds of things that go into it in different ways of\nTaking well a lot of it and you know a lot of people are facing that decision or talking to their coworkers yeah right right and they're asking them what they're doing yeah and their coworkers is not your life your life is your life\nYour coworkers might have a total different you know scenario going on and they're opting are choosing one type of election that are often having a pension plans that could be like a monthly income for the rest of your life\nAnd for you that might not make sense that if you take the lump sum and put it in an IRA but so that\nPeople need to ask what makes sense for me right again have the right feedback loops will be back with more coming up right after this [noise]\nNever know what's going to get with the promise you one thing

Paul and blurry Welsh and here's your host Joni see on it and we're\nBack with family financial focus here on WB the ten thirty am I'm ... and Larry while you're here and uh\nYou know we have so much wonderful information and more than that you're always very focused on having everyone that you talk to become more knowledgeable\nThat's always your your it seems to be the focus is you want people to understand how things work right you know I mean that's been the focus of our shell here because it gets just to complicate\nUnderstand your your um auction to understand your investments know what you own and why are you on it by and you know we're talking before the break about retirement packages and pension packages and it's overwhelming you get a I mean people come in with a stack of papers\nYou think you were I'm learning a new language try and you've got to figure out all these different decisions and again these decisions are usually every book all you can check off a pension option and then six months from now change your mind and you know if you check off a monthly income and you can't six months when I say I want the lump sum you don't have a lump sum you've got a monthly income ...\nRight right and I I think that's one of the things that were really trying to\nEncourage people to take the time when it comes to your money and money decisions\nYou know how we raced through life you know buying something quickly or do it we're so used to doing other things so fast instantly I just want to I'll just I'll just just just just mhm and then we go but when it comes to your money and investing that's not a quick\nProcess you know and that's why you have to you know so many times I sit here and I toss out\nA handful of different topics but you do this all the time you're constantly\n... is sometimes you hear these commercials on these big institutions saying\nYou can roll over your four one K. and Fifteen minutes and you know we have a four one K. specialist I can help you with that but that's just the mechanics that's just the process can design three are you a sign of arm and then they send it to the fall and K. and they're all the money over to the brokerage firm and that but rather overheads mechanic in it but if you look at it another way\nHey I worked at this employer for thirty six years I saved\nEvery pay period through good and bad I sacrifice some benefits that I could have taken more vacations I Hope that my kids more but I knew I had a safer I my retirement I had the sleepless nights when the market was down but I kept saving my so you know thirty forty years of saving and and okay\nYeah the the mechanics might be Fifteen minutes would maybe I should put more than Fifteen minutes on you know where this money is going to going to be rolled over to it how is it going to be allocated how am I going to take out the income I Need how's it going to grow how women are going to take out too much risk\nAnd my having somebody actually helped me with us up a fresh you know if I Am how how is he or she being compensated is it a fee bases commission based what if I'm not happy with the investment so you know maybe put more than Fifteen minutes in the decision before you do that Fifteen minute mechanics of rolling it over\nAnd do the research you know the ... are you talking yeah how are they getting um compensated how are they licensed what is that person's objective right and you know the thing that makes me crazy as if I talk to any of my friends or family members and somebody goes oh they said just do this\nAnd then I'm like well did you ask them how much they were getting ... no no and I'm like\nHow could you not ask all the right that's why I Love the I'm Charles Schwab commercialized that there's a new one where the brokers in front of the\nClass oh hey I've year\nOlds and yeah well how are you getting paid ... ... you know what is your cost and what if I'm not happy\nAnd they are like what are you teaching that but I Wish they were teaching kids at this age growing now I Know that empowered\nThe idea is that you should have a plan right right because the investment world has become so involved in it so much on the market place today offered through insurance companies and brokerage houses and Wall Street and it's just it's it's like we said before it's almost overwhelming like\nI I don't know where a best buy money right but before I started invested in my money we need to have a plan right you know again if you whatever age or out of your age sixty as an example of retirement is five or six years away you need a plan for your time it right you know you don't want to wait six months before you retire [laughter] you know but some people do they wait six months before he retired but\nIt is good to take some time\nAnd you have time you got you know five or six years do you take some time find a good adviser\nIt wherever that might be in it and then make sure that you have done they've done you're done with them a good analysis on what your knees are going to be as much as possible six years from now when you retire\nAnd then what are you going to need to do between now until that six year how's your money expected to grow up until that time how much money are you expected to contribute to your four one K. what's it going to look like five or six years from now are you going to have enough money\nTo sustain financial independence for the rest of your life or what are you going to have for income I'm going to have Social Security mhm that's it right right right I'm going to have Social Security and a pension\nOr going to have my Social Security myself as Social Security every one is in a different situation but without all that so to speak knowledge and information it would be hard to put together\nAn allocation of investments now not understanding what the goal is right at cheers from now right and I think so many of us are so quick like you said donate to make decisions without really doing\nThese things are funny to now says I just wanted I wanted off my to do list as you say all the time right so that would be good if you're buying a car or whatever I got the cars out there to drive but it's great I Love the color [laughter] when it comes to investments we can't think like that now I Know it's just not a color\nIt's important right you know your ability to be able to ... again ... financial independence for the rest of your life you need a plan\nAnd we talking about you know one of the things that I'm that I've learned from just hanging out with you is the importance of having that the proper sounding board the educated um feedback that you need I came in um\nYou know earlier this week and thinking about like well I I'm I'm watching the news earlier the week and they kept telling him out interest rates interest rates going up and I'm like\nOkay I don't know what that means does this mean I'm Out of luck if I'm going to try to buy a house right now does this mean that something's going to happen to my investments or what does that mean so for everybody who was wondering this week when you were watching the news\nGoing interest rates are going up and you sit there and go okay I have no idea how that's going to affect me how does that new wells that\nAnd that that's where you're really have to understand your investments and your allocation and your long term objectives and understand the different position to have in your portfolio and how they perform and what the daily values are and understand why you on certain positions and\nYou know we talk about this all the time and uh you know that as an average portfolio you'll have some stock fund that's on bond funds you know stocks your own you know basically shares of the corporation you profit them in the company does well with evidence and the share price going up bonds you're actually\nWhat a bond is or a bond mutual fund a mixture of bonds as you're actually loaning money to an institution whether it's a corporation or the government like the ten year treasury and what happens with Barnes is if new interest rates are going up and your own owning you own bonds that will purchase previously\nUm you can see a bond market share price go down so you know with the fed the ten year treasury one over three percent recently so what happens if you have individual bonds are bond mutual funds are bondi to yes those are all bonds that were purchased previously", "show_name": "Family Financial Focus with Paul Welch & Larry Welch from 93
