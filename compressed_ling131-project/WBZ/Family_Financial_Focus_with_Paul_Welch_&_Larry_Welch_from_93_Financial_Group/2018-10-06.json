... but it was one of the reasons why was the crash and one of the reasons why\nYou are passionate about having this conversation is because you were able to recognize so many of the elements of things that people just didn't know right you know it was just like just not knowing a term target date fund and how\nIt worked as a man how am I allocated to charge a law says no one's really explaining\nIn detail what does this mean for you\nWrite it up and I think that's the conversation that needs to take place ... is the explanation of what type of investments you know most investors are confused what they actually own right right ... back in that time in two thousand eight when you say target date funds they were\nPretty new at that point and most people do not understand the allocation within those funds themselves when they understood was\nAnd back then if I have I'm going to retire in two thousand ten and um that's my target date fund two thousand ten in the market dropped in two thousand eight\nThey were surprised and shocked at how much they actually the percentage of what they owned and that talk if I was in equities mhm um because a target date fund managers weren't looking at hey you're going to retire and two years\nAnd then only money's going to be in the bank or the money market they're saying hey you got to retire and two years and you know the way they look at that you're going to live another Twenty years of life right right so we need to have a you know still a good percentage of your money in equities for the growth you're going to need to ... retirement ... that was missed\nBy a lot of investors and so when the market you know a lot of investors back in that time\nIt it almost seems like it wasn't ten years ago when I modeling about thirty forty fifty percent yeah of their net worth and especially in their retirement\nMoney yeah and Larry just to reiterate that that was because when somebody has that option of just checking off something in your mind you're going oh a target date fund they must know what they're doing I'll just check here\nWithout really explaining well it's actually planning not on it's gonna be safer when you retire\nBut it's going to be invested in a way that is still quite risky because that's where the ... and you're going to need growth is\nSo there is benefits to target date fund because yes all the\nUm confusion sometimes and investors might have and what they should allocate and therefore one case so\nThe the managers of a target date fund again looking at a group I don't know how many that are in that group is just say you know just make it simple a hundred people in the group and I was hundred people this is how we should allocate someone in today's world\nAnd two thousand Eighteen is going to retire and two thousand twenty similar isn't it\n[laughter] God [laughter] scare 'em\nYou know they're ... manager those sort of looking at a group of people ... and they say okay so it could retire and two thousand and twenty [noise]\nThe average life expectancy for retirees is ex she looks just say I'm just I'm just saying one ear and okay so now we need to manage that money as if they need it for the next Twenty years so they still need a percentage of money inequities\nThat challenge there for investors who choose target date funds especially those who are retiring somewhat early in the next two to five or six years something like that is the group of people that they're\nPutting you into who ... ... what is their situation everybody has a different situation some people are going to retire with a pension some people are not going to retire with a pension if you need eighty thousand dollars a year of income and you have a pension is going to pay you fifty thousand\nThat's quite a bit different than if you need eighty thousand dollars of income and you don't have attention you only have Social Security doesn't twenty five thousand\nSo that difference or twenty five thousand when you when in target date fund they don't know that each of that of each individual\nSituation right they're just going to bring people together so you as the employee the investor need to understand that and then you need to understand what I have in his target date funds from my own purpose in my own personal life forgetting about the other Ninety nine people in that group right wasn't\nThat wasn't the fault of target date fund right was the fault of people not understanding\nUm know what they own and why they own it that's one of our you're saying yeah so I mean a target date fund like Larry said it's it's a fund\nThat the date that the data on the fun is based on when you plan on retiring and they usually based on five years are commensurate with today is the twenty twenty fund and then the twenty twenty five twenty thirty back in two thousand eight\nThe twenty ten fun to just like the twenty twenty fun today like we just mentioned\nBut where people did not understand as they said oh it's two thousand eight I'm retirement and two years I'm On the twenty ten fund so and twenty ten I Need all my money so it must be almost all the money market I have no risk right right and all of a sudden when the market took the fifty percent downturn they will cut their\nFour one K. is or their IRAs or whatever investments they had in these target date funds and wait a minute why is this down so much I thought I Need my money in two years they just didn't understand like Larry mentioned\nThe managers of those target date funds were looking at it not like you need all your money in twenty ten they looked at it like hey you're maybe around eight sixty five we still need to allocate this and a portion of equities and bonds\nBut it's still a pretty fair portion inequities because we need the income when they retire at sixty five plus the growth to keep up with inflation\nAnd um with all that said if they understand if the investor understood that even when I went down Johnny ... if they understood also you know the um the history of the market and understanding even if\nYou retire and twenty ten and even if your portfolio is down even twenty percent which is significant ... you know if you have\nA million dollars and all of a sudden it's eight hundred thousand when you retire but you really you don't eat all your money\nThe day you're going to hire me to start taking out a monthly income and when the portfolio was down you could just take your monthly yet it's not like every you know if you have a portion and ... and ... and a portion and bond funds\nAnd you need monthly income you know what we try to do for our clients just take it from whatever funds are doing the best at the time of course if you have all your eggs in one basket like one target date fund and that's down you have really no\nNo choice but to sell at a loss yeah that's why you know target date funds are okay but it's like the simple way of investing in our opinion um well it depends on the target date funds would do like some of them but um you know we like looking at all the different investment choices and coming up with your own portfolio\nYeah All right so when we get back we'll do a little update on the market and where we can go from here will be back right after this\n[noise] news radio ten thirty and Ninety three

Paul and Larry Welsh\nAre here and we're a reflecting back ten years we've been here ... busy about ten years now and I'm looking back I have here where where's and we're still here and not going anywhere and long way to go and are are of course has\nBeen a boy we we was you know baptism by fire as they say when we started it was just like people need information you know we just need to make sure that ah we're dedicated for a couple of hours a week to explain\nThe way the terminology works in the financial industry to hopefully get you to a point where at least you're asking the right questions no matter who you're working with him no matter who you're talking to right where are real focus is to empower you\nTo have the right questions to as you said Larry sometimes the first thing that we need to work on it just figuring out what do I mean what do I need and retirement right you know think about the date comes when you're not going to have that paycheck come there\nAnd I said well too is the so called in I Know\nFinally got to God did say it didn't you know many\nTimes you have complimented on writing just go ahead\nSo anyways is understanding what you own in why won't it might seem so simple to say but it's also very important right right right that's what we find is you know pollen I really do me one of the ... grassroots whatever they call it\nA lot of new people come into our office and we can see that there is confusion still out there yeah and people are not understanding the investments they have and not understanding you know sometimes what they purchase and then that could be like a\nSome type of annuity and what they have in their mind as an income account and as it gets very detail I Want to get into it but they're not understanding\nThe investments that would be properly um [noise]\nI'm Brett brings some synergy to what they need and for their own financial life now and there's just so much marketing out there but so many different types of investments there's confusion and we all have busy wise we just do and many people you know ... that we see are busy with their career\nAnd so it doesn't leave much time in any one week to sit down and kind of go over their investments ... you know they want to sit down and relax on friday and I don't want to sit down and say okay let's get our statements and figure out or the wire\nAnd what the hell we buy and who was that that ... who ten years ago or nine years ago you did something what was that and you know and I again I Am not a financial professional I'm just the person that\nIs like everyone else I'm like yeah I just want to make sure I have enough money to retire and you know I don't know the answers to things that's why I'm happy to be able to uh speak for people like me and will\nCome in to us I just want to make sure I'm OK Paul I weigh on track right that's what it really they don't want to come in by then you're done a yacht well maybe that who [laughter]\nNo but I mean like why are we said earlier it's like I ... well how much do I need when I retire how am I saving enough do I have enough as it invested properly ... these are all the questions and you know without talking about the last ten years have been terrific\nBut then you could say so what what have you done for me lately right or the next ten years yeah for yeah out in the last ten years that's why you know we talk about market today and even get a date I can talk about you know how the market's done yet a date so far this year\nBut in a way I say this all the time when the market's up where it's basically been up here most every you know basically almost every time we talked in the last ten years but um everybody's\nHappy but nobody's satisfied right has it's okay it's up about what's going to happen tomorrow and what you know um retirement and two years\nWhat's gonna happen to the next twenty five thirty years and I have to make sure that I'm okay my spouse was okay if you're married my children are okay so um and then we're in the sandwich generation you know I'm worried about\nI have two children in college and I have my own retirement and I'm helping my my mother wrote financially or she living with me or this elder law care so does you know so much going on with people today that it's it's hard to even take time to\nEven add up how much they have never mind how it's invested\nRight right right well and that's the thing you know as I was saying you can keep looking at your file folders and\nYou know some people don't know the difference between you know equities and a money market and you're like I they just see the bottom line number ... and don't even know how the percentages of what they have the or they see a pie chart and they go\nI think this is correct I don't know why\nYou know I I'm just frustrates me when I hear different even you know different commentators say things like\nOh I think we could be in for a correction and the next quarter I mean even um you might remember last month on August ... before you know I was saying you know I don't like when you competed also temper can be a very volatile much you care for I Would I could be in for corruption twenty percent\nCorruption and um you know you better be cautious but if the\nAverage investor here is that they could make them make a rational and emotional decisions you know the commentator might be thinking oh you know just be careful about investing new money maybe dollar cost averaging put a little bit in an ones but the average investor might say oh if the market's going to go down I just read that on the radio or on the\nTV show I should just sell everything and put it in cash I stopped adding money's my four one K. so you're making irrational um inappropriate in my opinion decisions on your long term portfolio yeah and then if you look at\nKnow just just to interject that when you're bringing up is so important depending on what people say and in this insane mediated world of messaging from social media to television to podcasts\nWe're getting information all over the place to look at just what happened with Tesla wet or know hey I think I got some investors that are going to take a ... like ... people are not understanding what they say yeah well that's an around the other\nThing that's why we say diversification is so important don't put all your eggs in any one basket you know you look at test like good the volatility on that ... different time periods in the last few months versus\nIf you you know if you own the U.S in the five hundred index for an example I'm not saying investing that but I mean you're on a five hundred largest companies in America so\nOne company does poorly the other four Ninety nine de do positively and you're so up right but if you put all your eggs in one basket you know you kind of at the mercy of that one company you could do very well there you could do very poorly but in my opinion you don't want to bet your financial future especially if you're close to retirement\nOn you know just a handful of companies on one company of course nice so um but with all that said even when you talk about the market and we're talking about all the ten year history now and the you know with ten year anniversary with a mock it had a huge decline but\nI I also want to be careful when you say the market because the average investor you know first of all what is the market and second of all you know you're saying the market is the stocks I mean most people don't have a hundred percent of the money in stocks funds you know they may have a certain percentage depending on\nYou know what they show some people don't even know what they chose say and therefore one K. you know if they choose a target date fund while yeah that means depending on the target date if it's a twenty twenty is going to have less than ... and a twenty thirty fund because it means you you know you're going to retire ten years earlier ten years later\nSo um you know what we say stay with your long term objective so\nIf you had the appropriate portfolio objective but at the beginning of this year depending on whether your retirement and two years you just retired or you've been retired for five years you're not retiring until ten or Fifteen Years\nIt's all a matter of how much inequities and how much in bonds but you stay with that long term objective that's how philosophy no matter what the news is no matter what the market cycles I Would no matter what the fair market out there\nBut you don't have to just\nLook at it and when the market's down just say oh that's too bad I guess I just have to wait or when the market's up say oh that's great but I Wonder if that's going down what we say is stay with the long term objectives but addressed the market cycles when the market's down well maybe that's a good time to actually\nTrim some of the bonds that are not down and buy more stock funds while they're down by the discount\nEvery other part of like people get that accept this their investments that\nWe've had this conversation so many times and it's it is amazing that this is the one area that you don't understand when the market's down it's like a ...\nIt's like you know if you look at it like real estate you buy a house a two family home in um whatever in Medford mhm and you get rental income and get paid four hundred thousand dollars so that to family home and yet you're making twenty thousand a year and rent mhm and then a year later\nReal estate market goes down if you want to sell that four hundred thousand dollar home while you couldn't sell it for more than three fifty but people don't say oh I'm Down to fifty thousand they say well not selling who cares\nAnd to put at even a at another spectrum\nIf the house next door one for sale for three fifty it might be saying jeeze that's a bargain I paid for a hundred dollars and another one for three fifty and get the same rent my butt so people get it and other parts of life our mortgage rates and things like that or people will probably driving home from school right now saving on paper towels because the down in price might go into\nSome other stores but um\nBut with your own investments I think it's because you just think of it as dollars you don't really think of it at different assets inside your portfolio ... that people don't really see that\nMuch so that but that's our job that's what we do for our clients and even you know and now you know if you trim you know if you buy when the market's down stay with your long term objectives but just to add more to the equities\nBut now like you had a day like I said you know the S. and P. as up about nine percent at the end of September the Dow Jones up about seven so that's just different indexes but basically you know the stock market's up well\nIf you are allocation as say sixty percent equities in forty percent bonds or maybe since the market's up you have a heavy awaiting inequities cause they're up like so what we say is well maybe it's a good time to rebalance from some of those equities\nThat are ... that you at the recent gains and put them into the bonds that are less well too so then if the market goes down over the next few months you already kind of took some of your profits mhm but yet you didn't get all enter all out so that's that's the real value\nRight and I think that's the most critical thing to understand is that you can't just you know the days of what did you call it buying hold you buy something and you're just spy and when we agree\nWith that by on hold but not just look at it by on hold and then address the market cycles bribery balancing and it's not as simple as just a portfolio is Thomas going yeah right\nYou know it's not just rebounded well looking at the investments and are they doing well compared to other ones and change an hour waiting at the national small cap and cabinet as a

B. C. news our\nSay for your own retirement if you're not receiving a pension or even if you are\nUm but then you're also dealing with the emotional aspect is um you know with the market's down oh you know should I keep putting my money in that I make a change so you're you're losing sleep at night first of all how much you're putting in and second of all is it invested correctly and the market cycles like we've been talking about\nUm then what happens now Joni with new people coming into the U.S\nIs still even say you know I remember ten years ago when the market crashed and\nIt really didn't affect me that much because I was saying well hey I got ten or Fifteen Years I'll make it up but I remember my co workers that were retiring soon and they were\nTerrified right now I'm retiring soon I don't want to be terrified Paul how I I'm not sure how I should be allocated I'm not sure if I'm On track I'm not sure if I'm taking on too much risk but I also want to make sure that I\nGet the growth I Need ... so that's you know what we do for a new people coming in and of course our current clients is just the whole financial plan\nHow much you have now how much you contributing what that can grow to in the future when you retire how much income you can pull from that what do you receive and from other sources\nUh we put inflation on that and with the income you ... your withdrawing on a annual basis when you retire\nUm you know basically the number one question people lab and what we're showing them is does your money last as long as you do write you know we say it you know you don't need a million dollars at age a hundred but you don't want to run out at age eighty to ... you know that's the the whole question there so these retirements studies that we um [noise]\nPrepare for the people coming in and for our current clients they find a lot of value on it because like Larry says and she's I never really sat down and saw the numbers like this if I if we keep doing what we're doing we're more than on track right\nUm but that's just again it's it's a retirement study or really every time a projection or every time a plan\nBut with any plan you got to work the land mines so that's just the beginning but then you know you become our client we we worked to plan first of all how do we set up the portfolio for the growth rates that we're project and in second of all how do we address the market cycles like duck will likely talked about\nAnd then um you know with our clients we like to get together with them regularly you know at least once a year or so and say okay you know we when when we get together we update their retirement studies okay this is how much\nYou had last year and this is um you know now that sat up everything this year and then we look at the projection how you doing better than projected a worse than projected\nIf you're doing better hey we're better than on track and you're doing worse than why is that are you not saving as much as you said as a portfolio not performing as projected at least you can address at now\nOh then rather it's not like instead of doing these ah production and say okay I'll see you in ten years like you know you've got to work the plant\nA lot of times people just don't even know what that's all about you know I don't know how what do you mean work the plan because I I okay I'm supposed to be adding money but you know what is wonder why you know\nRight well the average investor Joni they're not going to [noise]\nYou know ... some do but for the hours invested ... understand how do you put a plan to get right right that's why they take the advice of someone like us advisors you know we're independent investment advisors but there's plenty\nOf planners and that can be you know did you can go and sit down with [noise] and go through that whole process and everyone does it a little different way\nAnd we have our own way of doing something right and you know it's not that we put a hundred percent of our money's clients in stock or a hundred percent of my clients money in ... whatever it might be but we take our time\nWhen people come in and we go through a whole process and we understand\nYou know where they are at what they are trying to accomplish what their investments and then\nWith all that information then we put together all these investments we believe are appropriate for you to own mhm because we spent that time and understand what you're trying to accomplish and your financial world mhm it's just too many times that we see is people are compulsive I think and they have little time to do things and so\nIt's they still have that fear\nDo I have enough money for retirement and they looking for the easy way out so to speak or hearing\nSome of the marketing that's going on like Paul said before the fear of that they use fear marketing like hey you might run out of money you should buy this financial products right and um they might be tempted to to go ahead and buy that financial product and might not understand everything about is\nJust being honest 'cause ... again one of the grassroots we see it right and so I purchased is two years ago because I I was fearful the market\nBecause I heard a commercial and I got to run out of money so you need to buy this financial products will plug into it's\nAlso being marketed as this one thing so when you're talking about we've got a plan to work you need stocks you need bonds you need principle protected you need this people all of a sudden go well I don't know how to do all of that so if you have one thing and somebody tells you just by this one thing and you'll be ...\nConsider the source because some of the sphere marketing it's it's amazing that\nThey're actually happy when the market goes down it's like when the market's up it's like whoa sooner or later the market may go down you might run out all your money you need to invest in something that you're not going to lose the money but then when the market's down like hey I told you the market was going to go down and you need to invest in something that you you don't want to lose anymore right so\nUm but that type of fear marketing usually gets just offering one type of product and it's really putting the product instead of putting up putting a plan together\nAnd you know they're offering all kinds of bells and whistles with income guarantees and all that but uh we'll\nJust think of the words that their use\nYou're guaranteed income share you know don't lose the money so what we say his forget all that come up with inappropriate plan for yourself\nAnd then you can kinda interpret what all these different investments can do for you or you can even kind of interpret when you hear these different market commentaries are different commercials about different types of investments\nAnd I and I would only just just when I you know talking to my friends are ... and I'm explaining the stuff that I've learned from you\nMy friends all of a sudden we'll come back to me and they're like ah they feel empowered they're like yeah I heard dot comers I knew exactly what they were talking about I read it but you didn't before we had our conversation did you and they're like no they make it sound so good\nLike that commercial you educated consumers are best customer and we are as yeah you know there are many of those financial products out there and some of them are really good and it would be appropriate for you to have somebody in one of the\nYou know you you think about your your you have a hundred percent of your money don't put too much in any one place like ... what happens is if you have what'd you say an agent that is selling these type of products\nThey're making commissions mhm so I'm not saying that would you know if there'll be happy that you put more than less so they're gonna make a logic commission right you know so you're just is nothing wrong with\nHer mission but you just need to understand those products and make sure that the price of it for you and don't just get one for advice get multiple if I start we'll be right back [noise]\nNever know what's going to get

and Larry Welsh and here's your host ...\nAnd our back with family financial focus here on ... ten thirty am I'm ... piling Larry well chair here and uh\nI think we we now know how you guys work [laughter] I was going to run down and I I think that's really nice to know that that literally it's going to be like hey we'll see for our second meeting in for the third and we're here and I like Paul sign you always say we're ready when you're ready\nTo go we we actually said um you know this is at the end result of all that\nIs again you hope you we hope that they would like to become a client but you should take this you should go um interview other planners you know and then you go with who you feel most confident and there's got to bring the best value to your situation obviously you know you always it's\nNot just okay the transparency and how they're compensated and how they're going to help you but also you want to feel comfortable communicating with them you don't feel emitted or if they're talking over your head I mean that doesn't help you that's your money you should feel confident about\nAnyone right I mean after if you decided to be one of our clients then obviously and our investment advisory were not receiving any commissions were getting paid along the way it's my explain right now\nSo the idea here is we want to give the best service that we can give and it's not just pollen I sit in an office we have a whole staff night right or some people do some do we have to um younger twin brothers were also investment visors and\nUm so the money gets actively\nManaged it's not it's not passive and\nQuickly explained that 'cause you said at a few times when we've done it in many\nShowing a soda and foundational relationship I guess if you're using a broker like Paul explained earlier British to represent our angel planner and the way they are getting compensated is upfront commission so you invest money they make a commission up front so the question always becomes well how much time is going to be spent\nOn the management of my accounts if you if you already made your money [laughter] right right I mean you just think about it in a business sense right\nAnd so in what commissioner you are you making and what can I expect going forward like Paul explain as a transaction Mike with us it's totally different there is no upfront commission were getting paid along the way so we actively manage our clients accounts because in the first if you're paying someone up front for the commission which is fine that's what you want\nIs just so you they might put you in five or six different mutual funds that could be two or three mutual fund families and so when it comes time to rebalance six months from now if they're taking money from one mutual funds ... family and put it in another mutual fund family because that's what the allegation is calling for while they're going to make a new commission because it's going from one\nCompany to another company and so that type of relationship is more commission driven\nAnd it's again transaction like Paul explain and there's no fight ... responsibility of managing that money\nBut is that that's that's not the same as active manager\nRight active management is is different there is no commissions up front\nWe charge a one percent annual fee it comes out of our clients that points to five percent on a quarterly basis\nSo every quarter after the quarter we send our clients so to speak like a letter mhm wish I'm exactly what's being taken out for our feet and it's also on their child swab statement [laughter] okay so it's completely transparent they know it\nSo he became our client today it could be you know six months from now we're rebalancing your account because he equities have done well let's just say some of the ANC and lost some of the games the equities and put them into the bonds\nAre unfortunately the equity was went down we can be selling some bonds and buying equity is way down in value okay but that just happened\nSo that's what you're constantly dealing you're keeping an eye on yeah constantly monitoring\nThe portfolios but we're only going to rebalance Johnny if we think it's going to help you were not going to do it just to show hey we balance right rise all we want our clients to do is do well right and we're not going to just make a transaction just to make it look good because of our clients\nMoney goes down our revenue goes down if I ... when he goes up I revenue 'cause we're only going to make a change if it helps our clients because it helps us\nOkay so explain a little bit just if you had this actively managed diversified portfolio\nOver the past decade now let's we'd seen because we didn't expect the market to do what it it's stealing the growth of the world so you're constantly when it keeps going up while it's your time over the last\nTen years we decided to rebalance our clients portfolio when the stocks like I said earlier this evening\nHey if they're you know of our clients allocation\nObjective is Seventy percent equities and thirty percent bonds well of course if you just kept the equities for the last ten years you'd be probably Ninety five five now because he said the equities kept going up right so the idea is to trim the equities over time and in allocate those gains into the bonds or you stay with that Seventy thirty is not just that simple but we're also looking at\nYou know how much waiting should we have an international at certain time periods versus um you know the U.S economy how much we haven't lodge kept stocks mid cap stock so much should we have a long term bone structure and bonds government bonds I mean there's a whole\nScience behind our portfolio management it's not just old Seventy thirty it's you know there's a whole strategic portfolio set up and you're doing all the work we're doing on work and it's not just\nIn the other thing is we um we have no allegiance to the investments are even to Schwab are legion swat clients in other words\nIf you've been our clients will last ten years\nYou know some of the mutual funds and exchange traded funds we had ten years ago we don't have today because if we felt they weren't performing as well as other funds were going to sell that and by the other one mhm 'cause we can we use and no commission funds though it doesn't cost our clients any any commission to buy one funded by another phone\nIn if we feel it's going to help our clients that also helps us so it's a real partnership I mean it's really all we want our clients to do is do well\nAnd where we're really believe that a diversified portfolio and our opinion is going to bring better results and so you need a percentage in equities you need a percentage and bonds and percentage in principle protected are constantly manage all that\nBut that's quite a bit different than what we were talking about I guess in the last segment yeah if you go to a broker which is fine but you know what I hear the word broker\nIt's always like well I Want to buy purchased a stock like there's a good stock there it's and it's down in value it's a good by let's do it\nAnd that's fine it's grace there's nothing wrong with that but then don't do it themselves 'cause I ... yeah brokers or you know they could they could assist you and they give you their opinion on different stocks and you should purchase in good times to buy it and sell it\nIt was just re value with her on us out saying they're ... I mean what you're looking for a different relationship but then sometimes\nYou wouldn't have to go and saying this is what I'm looking right well I I Know about\nYour own a golf course and your golfing and yet ... says oh I got a hot stock I call my broker and see if that's a hot stock or not I'll call you broke a what do you think about the stock yeah it's a good by okay let's do it okay that's like a broker right I mean that's what I think of them I Want to broker\nBut but then you know sometimes what we see is there is a you know a life insurance agent that selling I knew it was just a commission based type of products and sometimes they come in and people do not exaggerating sometimes it's three or four or five hundred thousand dollars\nAnd they put it all into one financial product ah and then there with the with these people don't understand they didn't ask is first of all what ... what is the agent receiving for a commission did you did you find out I don't know we don't have any idea\nAnd what is this you know how does this whole account work well I remember how it generally work but I remember all of it you know so I I just firmly believe that if you got to work with an advisor who ever it is you should understand how they're being compensated uh-huh so if I put four hundred thousand dollars in this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Family Financial Focus with Paul Welch & Larry Welch from 93 Financial Group", "city": "Boston", "day": "06"}
