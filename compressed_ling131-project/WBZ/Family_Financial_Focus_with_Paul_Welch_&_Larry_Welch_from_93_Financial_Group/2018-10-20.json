I'm Garofalo POW easy news our top story I have is our state police are investigating a tragedy on the north shore WB Xi's Karen regal has details\nTwo three four opinions and where\nAnd they just make up they assigned something or they purchase something or they do something they make an irrational um decision on something that's eerie bocce ball that\n... they take Fifteen they call I guess this is I guess\nI guess this is what time is you know and say even told me families are trying to accomplish things maybe um\nProtect assets a gift or whatever it might be ... and sometimes good intentions turned out to be the wrong results like hey we want to protect our house will just gifted to our son right but that could be a benefit in one way but a disaster in another way right\nRight so the only the only way I'm gonna I'm gonna give you all these scenarios okay just in the course of a week I've been a host too and I can say well hang on let me [laughter]\nThis is what I think let me double check and we'll talk about it Saturday Night so I have people tuning in right now on board I said I Will have your answer on Saturday Night on the radio\nWhat we do we feel a lot of situations with families especially those who would you say fifty eight sixty two years old to retire within you know several years and and that's they are going to retire in ... years so they have a lot of questions\nAnd like Paul explain some of those questions could be how do we protect some of our assets because we obtained this wealth ... we want to protect us wealth and how do we go about that how do we set up our\nUm investments to supply the needs we're gonna have to maintain financial independence for the rest of our like ... and we don't want to make any irrational decisions we don't want to make quick decisions we want to do the right thing um [noise] you know because they've probably many people in one way or another by the time you reach the age sixty have been hurt [laughter]\nYou know they've had their challenges they've had taken advice and both in a good side and the bad side and so you know you live live long enough and then you become wider and wider as you go along also [laughter] hopefully and you want to do that in any arena mhm in your life and you you could take any um [noise]\nPlace right now that let's say for an example buying real estate mhm if you're buying real estate right now you feel pressure\nYou go look at a home now and there's ten of the people looking at the same home and you know they're ready to put a down payment on that home or I'll I'll pay cash for it mhm so you're under pressure you don't know what's in the pipes you don't know if the water system works right you don't know if they eat works right you know if the roof\nNeeds repair which any addict or you know you've got ten minutes to make a decision or someone else was going to buy that house before your life that is pressure yeah\nWhat do they call that formal right fairy I said oh I was in the stock market that has yet to end before before it keeps going up\n... you start timing the market and you'd be under the pressure every single day why he's right because it's hard to make the right decisions like you could say I got to get all my money out of the market today 'cause I think there's gonna be a major correction and the next month or so might you might be right\nYou might be wrong ... and if you're wrong then when you put the money back in the market goes up another five percent and you're sitting on the sidelines still\nSo we believe a better approach is to look at it you know in a long term objective and make sure you're allocated you know in a means that wherever the market's going down you don't have all your money and the stock my at the market's going up you have enough\nIn the stocks to provide the growth so you're going to need to keep up with inflation so it's important to understand what your objective is and the closer you get to retirement your objective changes it's no longer I'm forty years old I'm fifty years old and I want to obtain wealth\nSo that I'm going to have enough in my nest egg for retirement\nIf you're close to retirement that objective is now over your objective is to maintain financial independence for the rest of your life is I Try to beat the market a time the market to get credit games it is to maintain that financial independence so that's different for everyone some of us retire and we have\nYou know you could take 'em [noise]\nLooks example for two teachers ... they might not have a lot of money put away um because they've had their career where they enjoy their teaching but it doesn't provide as much you know income as maybe some other careers but what they do have is tensions mhm so if you take your husband and wife and they've been teaching for the last Thirty years when they retire their pensions\nCould just about to take care of all their income nice so that they don't need a million dollars and the bank right right but if you retire and have a million dollars in the bank and you retain that wealth\nAnd the only source of income you have a Social Security and you need you know more than double what your Social Security is for your own financial independence while you need that million dollars to provide that income for you you're in a different situation mhm so everyone has their own challenges in regards to how do we invest for the future\nBut before you can make the decision to where you actually invest and that's what you're talking about my job to care for all you have to look at it in a holistic point of view and understand what what are you trying to accomplish\nAnd didn't understand that first what am I going to need from for income and my retirement how am I going to invest this money and then you know uh for my guys we get all that information we do a whole analysis and then\nAfter all that analysis two or three meetings then we're proposing would investments you should have so you don't want to make quick decisions\nAre sometimes what we see is a people come into office and and they've been you know wherever else that might be and they felt pressure to buy some type of financial product are to invest in something but they didn't feel comfortable with but\nThe the the um [noise] person on the other side of the table the advisor they felt pressure because they just they just felt like they were trying to sell something so you shouldn't feel pressure in anything to do it in life give it time and make the right decision\nAnd and have that elevated conversation and what I'm hearing you just say now is you start off with you are the ones questioning the people that you're talking to rather than you know them asking you ... you're saying well we need to know what your objectives are and we have to start with that\nBecause everyone has different scenarios you know and everybody\nYou were saying life can be messy and all of a sudden what you thought you know your life was going to be when you start\nThat this off all of a sudden you're like yeah the divorce cost me that\nWell okay you know so we're all in different scenarios life gets in a way of life right right right so we really want to start off with an individual conversation to meet your needs to be the best place to start All right we'll be back with got a great show for night for tonight I'm Glad you're with us we'll be right back\n[noise] news radio ten thirty and Ninety three financial a perfect combination for the

conserve what you currently have stages in your life changed since you and your investment are you asking yourself it's not how much I earned but how much I keep or maybe you're okay with the\nUps and

got\n[laughter] has hears that I've been talking I feel good to feel like me [laughter] as long as you might feel so smart well\nYou know what and I I I Am so amazed that some of these things that I feel that people expect\nThis to be in their their knowledge base you know I'm a professional I Am a nurse I'm a teacher I Am a you know I'm an engineer or of course I should know how to do my finance I should be able to know how to plan for retirement\nBut the industry changed so fast and it was never about making sure that what the financial world was putting out there\nIt was really the intention was not to have a well informed consumer subtitled feels like that yeah I Know I Know you're nicer than I Am I'm like\nThe wall Street Journal ... your life\nHas your wealth and especially if you're not receiving a pension you know wherever you're saving on your retirement programs or whether it's\nUm you know nonprofits and you've got the four o three bees or ... or for fifty seven is whatever it is\nThat is what if you add up you know whatever you accumulate that is your pension and it's just amazing how people say oh I should be able to do this on my own but yet if you make a mistake it could be catastrophic because there's your your retirement\nAnd anything else in your life if there's a medical issue with you you know because oh I'll just look it up and take care of myself farms hey my electrical\nUm why aren't in the house needs to repair I'll just go to Home Depot and my some some clubs [laughter] you know I go to hire an electrician or end up um electrocuted myself\nBut with the financial world is just people expected it understand it but it's um it's like you said it's overwhelming\nAnd it's because it's not our knowledge base and so what happens is sometimes people find somebody well we went in and we\nWell we ... we have to pay this person you know twenty five hundred bucks up front to three thousand dollars up front and they are going to give us our financial plan because we really don't know how to do it ourselves and then they're like well they told us to do well there are way going\nI don't feel right right I mean literally just into just than that it's like oh but we have to we have to pay them the rest of the I'm like ... see paid the money you don't feel right it didn't feel right to you\nLike ... mindset now if I have to go back and pay him a second I'm like you don't have to do anything like that I don't feel right\nYeah it's funny how when you well it's just like when you go to the doctor I but I Do what they tell me\nMy ... and so if you go into a financial professional what's it's it's overwhelming just understanding all the different types of investments and how do you take out income when you retire and what type of and you know should I have mutual funds exchange traded funds individual stocks bonds whatever\nBut then you go seek out a professional and like I was saying before the break those different types of professionals and the average person has no idea who they are dealing with and how they're being paid and what they can offer\nSo I'm In that situation like you're from there if they went and met with a a financial fresh you know I mean some shoes to charge a financial planning the upfront and\nAnd so you pay them but it's not like\nEvery professional does that but people probably just don't know that I find I'm like I was saying before the break the different types of licenses you know a I'm a broker really as a registered representative of a brokerage firm and um you know that's what they call a suit ability license\nAnd then we talked about as an investment advisor license that stuff I Do Sherry to the client and that's what we are here in our investment advisory as I Do Sherry and I'm\nIn the other type of license is what they call just an insurance agent license and that's the offer you know in the ... in the financial world that's the offer um annuities are life insurance or long term care insurance but basically those are mostly commission base and it's under the insurance state insurance regulators so\nNo they're not only from advisors who are always looking at it from the perspective\nThat you want to have your money for the most part you want to have your money I I don't want to lose any money so you know they sell insurance\nProducts are usually Olin with money you know but um you know went out for him here we're an investment advisory firm and like I said as a ah if I Do sharing and we do the fee based planning and [noise] excuse me losing my voice here but as an investment advisor I'm\nAs a fee based at most one of the most important parts of that name as we advise\nWe don't hold your money that's another question you want to ask if you're going to a professional where where's my money going to be held in my opinion you want it to be held at a ... you know a well known from that you feel comfortable with and we use you know one of the most well known friends out there is Charles Schwab\nSo our clients that they want our help we open up Charles Schwab accounts right our office you know whether it's an IRA or joined account of trust account or whatever it might be\nSo your money is at Schwab\nYou got the comfort of knowing your money's worth the big from you could just statements from ... to go on Schwab dot com no people come on or off as the looking on the ... right on the phone ... um but you get the hands on advice in the act of management from us mice so it's like you get their hands on personal advice but you just you know you got the comfort of knowing your money's\nWith the big from 'em\nSo with that said um you know that's as an investment adviser and then a few in a as our insurance um you know we're also an insurance agency because sometimes we could do a great job growing your money but if you do need some protection or if you need life insurance or\nIf you're looking forward to put a portion of your money in in a um [noise] financial vehicle that has no risk somebody maybe do a little bit better than the bank then those are insurance products ... you know as I\nAs a producer we tell our clientele you if you want us to implement this insurance product for you then we're going to receive a commission we tell them how much the commission is we everything's totally transparent we just want to make sure they get what they need my a\nRestoration that we've heard over the years joining we've been doing this for over twenty five years now so we do have some experience but you know there's more in the marketplace now than ever has been before for best friends in financial products there just is\nAnd that's good that is a very good thing and plenty for retirement is you have so many different opportunities now it's an adventure\nAnd you should enjoy it [laughter] you don't want to be bogged down with you know all what we've just been discussing I Hope I get the right investments in ... and I hope I have the right and visor and all that but the frustration that pollen I hear over the years is a number one I Would say is people feel like when they go see certain types of\nUm independent agents are financial planners\nSometimes not all the time but sometimes I feel like they're being pressured into buying some type of financial products are being pressured to um invest in some type of mutual fund whatever it might be and you know so you have to ask yourself as a consumer good thing for you to understand\nIs that okay if I'm going to pay the person on the other side of the table the advisor\nIn upfront commission that's fine as long as I understand my mission they're making I understand that as a transaction [laughter] and I'm not expecting them to manage just money going forward because it was a transaction right\nAnd you know and in reality there are very good honestly very good brokers liners that do keep up with things and they helped their clients and its great life but they make that up front commission so the ... the incentive\nAn all types of situations and questions come up and review meetings and it could be like Paul mentioned ... should a downsized so many people ... you know who are are at that stage or if he we decided to downsize we're selling our property and we're going to buy a place in Florida are all going to buy a condo or whatever it might be and\nSo we're talking about that the next question should be what types of trust that I have to avoid you know probing and and to avoid or eliminate you know a state taxes\nAnd the next question could be I have a daughter just graduated\nIn college and we want to buy her a gift or this money for it to do it it's so that's just that's just you know ongoing management so\nSee we're looking at a spreadsheet and just numbers and investments you're taking into lifestyle and what's happening in some like the reality is helpful\nYou have a an unusual life actually my background is managing the portfolio but it's helping them with everything right and I said it's not just because we do have numbers we have graphs we show them in yeah clearly what the performer Chinatown mhm are after review meanings I mean it was like a ... there's a there's a graph this is your money you started you know seven and a half years ago\nAnd this is this is the growth of your money ...\nDone it on one of the other most I guess one of the uh common comment we get from New people coming in and saying you know I've\nI've had this little account here for I don't know how long are I've been working with the same advisor for twelve years and I asked him you know how we actually done you know as far as performance over the years oh well you made changes here and then we we open this account of clothes Atacama we change this investment so we can't really give you an exact\nBut I I don't agree with that because like why are we just said when our clients come in for a review meeting whether they've been with us for\nA seven month so seven years ... they they um [noise] the reports that we give them show them exactly how much they burn from day one like how much you know what they started with or you know even after withdrawals or if they've been out and contributions but it shows pure performance\nFrom day one like what you ... get a date from January till today what you averaged over the last one year three year five year Mars since you've been with us so it's nice to see that\nHey I'm about what you have to realize as this 'cause I think what goes on with many um [noise] a consumer is that says that who am I\nYou know here I Am going to get ready to retire and two years and I have you know eight hundred thousand dollars in my four oh one K. and I got a couple of hundred thousand dollars in the bank and you know altogether we got this money but you you you feel like a you know just the sand in the seashore ...\nBut you wouldn't believe the marketing that goes behind just the marketing you see on TV is one thing but behind all that all these different firms in Wall Street and insurance companies and different advisory groups the amount of attention they would give\nFor each individual four one Kay Allen because everybody wants when you retire they want to take management of that for a woman and behind the scenes pollen I get emails constantly every single day from all these marketing firms on you know how go about\nYou know talking to a consumer which had to obtain management over four one K. or to sell some type of financial products for four one K. we don't we don't pay attention to any of it [laughter] yeah I'm telling you that is what how important you are wow you were listening right now you are very important to Wall Street\nMarketing companies insurance companies they put a tremendous amount of marketing behind the management of hopefully\nAble to have you transfer your role over your four one K. to one of their

G. dot com\nThe preceding broadcast has been a commercial presentation paid for by the Ninety three financial group family financial focus continues after the news [noise]\nW. Veasey buses WXXI Kay s F ... two men and I had radio station\nThis is W. B. C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never saw\nSomebody made the news times seven o'clock we've got fifty eight degrees partly cloudy skies in Boston turning chilly tonight with a little forty two trafficking whether together coming up I'm Garofalo BMW busy news our top story out this hour\nAnd if you just picked out a few companies from that us and the five hundred list just pick out a few states McDonald's Coca Cola and Raytheon so um if McDonald's stock goes down last week which is I went down in value\nYou know and you won't McDonald stock is part of your portfolio\nWell I I don't believe McDonald's is going out of business now\n... I I just don't think that's going to happen I think people are gonna still eat hamburgers I must say [laughter] you can have a hamburger and a very healthy economy and you might eat a few more hamburgers and an economy that's not doing so well my McDonald's is one of those types of stocks\nWhere you wouldn't you wouldn't think the guy go into business just because the value of the stock went down the share price and in fact the share price went down those companies those type of companies tend to pay a lot of different and so if you have dividend reinvest and you're actually when that happens you're actually buy more shares of the same stock while I was down in value because when I go down\nAnd you automatically reinvest it while it was down to\nDefeat and got paid and brought more shares is loud on okay so when it goes back up again you're rewarded for that mhm so that in my opinion is a better situation on those type of stocks and it is to you the way I explained it in a meeting as you're driving up and down one twenty eight or Ninety three or route one\nAnd you see a sign on the side of the road and it says Coca Cola you say I Know who they are mhm yeah a Proctor and gamble I Know who they are my but who stay aside and said you know John and Mary's whatever on the side of a building\nManufacturing you used to I have no idea what they're manufacturing inside that building I just have no idea that could be like a small kept company it could be a very successful company it could be doing very well\nAnd it was an investor you might make a better than\nThan a larger company mhm but you're taking on more risk because it's it's not the size of Coca Cola my you're safe so it's important in every main era you as the investor understand what you're trying to accomplish so you don't want to have too much waiting in stock too much waiting and bonds or too much waiting in principle protected accounts\nSo in the markets are ball 'til they had been over the last couple of weeks or so then you can say well you know what the stocks went down but I didn't have a hundred percent of my money in stock on purpose [laughter]\nAre you going to say when the stocks go up and say well you know I didn't I it was just talks of going out you say I Wish I had a hundred percent on Monday and stock but I don't want to take that type of risk so it's having an application\nFor you as an individual what investments should you have based on what you're trying to accomplish for your own retirement which is financial independence\nAnd you know we do this show to get lessons like that because so many times we just don't even know we hear these terms\nOh bonds and socks and large can I I think I'm supposed to know all that and when you were just explaining all that Larry sometimes people feel like well I I think I'm supposed to be doing this and I don't know what I'm doing so I won't do anything because I don't really know how it all work\nI'm just very impressed with Larry\nI you know but I and I explained\nYou know to to people and we we tell everyone here you know when you sit down or when you have this this is what you end up to what you hear is what you get although when you come in and meet with you guys you usually do it on the white board while you're very or individual more individual and you're explaining it and I understand and we're just\nGiving general knowledge with the airwaves here and even ... it's like we can go one step further Larry mentioned oh yeah you you know large cap stock McDonalds and Coca Cola and Raytheon\nAnd have the evidence reinvest in the same company ... because McDonalds not going out of business but you go to even be careful saying that life will just went out of business\n... went bankrupt last week [laughter]\nRight right oh here's isn't going\nOut of business and this new company called Amazonian is out of that kind of the rain forest Seattle and books by um [noise]\nSo you know the other very important um piece of the puzzle when our opinion is don't put all your eggs in any one investment don't put all your eggs in like individual stocks our philosophy is diversification so rather than\nJust owning Sears that went bankrupt or even look at a company like General Electric you know Twenty years ago gee how can you go wrong when she and all of a sudden now the G was kicked off the Dow Jones been because and you know it's actually gone up quite a bit recently but it was down like fifty percent of a one year like last month\nSo I'm you know opinion you want to diversify in what we use our mutual funds and exchange traded funds that whole many individual positions you know instead of owning two or three starch own hundreds of stocks or one company does poorly the other\nThree hundred four hundred or whatever you know make up for the idea of investing in\nUm securities whether it's bonds of stocks it's really for the objective of that part of the market was you're investing in stocks to get long term growth\nUm you can do that with one stock and maybe get a ride but you could get it wrong you know like GE or ... but if your overall objective is to hey I Want the the growth of the market in our opinion invest in a well diversified portfolio quality stocks of quality mutual funds that old and stocks\nThat way you got the objective of the market without taking on the risk of individual physicians\nDo you feel that way and the people that you're working with one on one when they actually come to that understanding of the plan like\nOh I ... I now I get all ... now I Know when I'm dealing\nThat that is the thing the understanding is the thing that allows them to feel more at\n... people come in for the first meeting and\nI'm just thinking of you know you always taken in the past week and that to you know my co workers say I should have this much money by the time I retire and oh my coworkers semi formal case it or burn this month she had a date 'em as didn't do that\nAnd I'm like well guess what you're not you're co worker you know let's worry about you and your family and your spouse and it's so easy to get off track about what everybody else is doing and of course everybody\nAn expert about your own finances instead of worrying about themselves you know so I like um so what do we want to do is say OK let's look at you what are your objectives on what type of portfolio is appropriate for you and what are you are when companies when you retire\nAnd then we'll come up with the real number is ... and that's when you know you should feel more comfortable and more more on track with yourself because you got your own plan not what everybody's telling you should have mhm\nYeah All right we've got more coming up right after this [noise]\nYou never know what's going to get with the promise you one thing we were five [laughter] oh yeah I don't I\nCan show you the movies or TV and general information fifty thousand was Morgan Oregon I Love your show it's such a pleasure to talk of\nI Love this microphone I Love talking to you is your the faster Morgan show more than ... wife here on WB news radio ten thirty [noise]\nHello we're Paul and Larry well from the Ninety three financial group and host of family financial focus hurt Saturday evening at six pm here on WB they\nWent well let's take a moment and talk about for one k.'s and retirement planning\nBall the traditional pension plans offered by employers are becoming something of the past many now just offer for one case putting more responsibility on the employees to secure their financial future\nThat trade Larry's important to remember that four one K. accounts may be the main source of income during your retirement years\nThat's why many are saying I really need to pay attention this time I only have a few years left before I retire\nHow many years of income your four one K. or IRA provide are they invested properly\nFor answers to these questions and more call Ninety three financial group an eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three or four that's eight hundred nine zero eight nine three three or four it's tied to create a new plan for your retirement for more information including their disclosure visit Ninety three F.

financial focus and with Paul and blurry Welsh and use your host ... on it\nWe're back with family financial focus here on WB easy ten thirty am I I'm Tony ... and pollen Larry Welsh you're here and I'm One of the things I really like about this conversation is it's really practical this is such a difficult conversation a because sometimes\nYou know you were saying it earlier all of a sudden people are just talking over your heads yeah and you know let me drop some knowledge on my financial literally you know when they're talking about things and you know they're talking down to you\nSometimes when you tolerate people or even listen to them on TV or radio all the experts and that ... and ... and the whole thing is well let's talk like this because then I'm going to have people think I'm really what gets Martin\nAnd then they're not going to know what the heck I'm Talking about but they'll go well I guess she knows what she's talking about I guess I never do it it sounds like he knows who knows yeah and I think that's sometimes as one of the things that\nThat happens but again you know since I've been doing this I get very very passionate when I start to hear about somebody I Know that might do something that I Know is in Iraq\nBold decision ... without having talked to three or four different professionals because a lot of times people come I don't have time to talk to\nA lot of people I'm already talking to this guy ... already gave them this soldier well they're they're they're an elder attorney they must know what they're talking about but I'm like you have to get a second opinion so\nI don't know it's amazing like the look at your like your four one K. you worked forty years of your life Thirty years ago life whatever it is saving saving saving and you're going to make a Fifteen minute decision on where to roll that overall is the best thing with an hour and going to be invested so that's\nWhat we're saying the and the you know the last segment of the show is if you're feeling pressure like someone's trying to sell you something and our opinion and you should just hold off right you know the world isn't going to change because you don't make that decision that day or without Waco that month you know you should go\nAnd and for all of us in any area of life especially financial area right because yeah you you need your wealth to maintain financial independence my right before you make any major decisions are purchased or invest in any you know major way you should you should get\nYou know advice in opinions before you make that decision to seek out two or three planets down with them you\nKnow you're at higher domain right when I go in and if they knew that telling me I Need for new tires and then somebody goes I talk to my guy and then you\nGuys like yeah now you only need to uh you know and I and you're like oh you know and then it's like oh it's pretty evident but\nYou know like say you're talking about your your nest it yeah I mean yeah you've worked Thirty years accumulated wealth don't make any quick decisions if you sit down with two or three plan as you you should have a good idea of who you feel comfortable with ... and have them do their own analysis each independently and then you sit down with them yes it takes some time yeah\nBut we're talking about your ... your whole life take the time\nYou know you don't have to do it all in a week it could be done over a couple of months and then you get\nYou go with who you feel comfortable and confident and\nWho you feel is going to have your best interest in in you know actively managed accounts going forward because\nThe advice isn't just for now it's for now in going forward my so life is life and chain and changes and for you know many of our clients were meeting them once or twice a year and things in their life changes and that could give a reason why we\nI might change the allocation the way we're investing the money or the way that money is being distributed on a monthly basis because of taxation or\nUm you know it could be talking about\nSaving on taxes by having the right trust or we could be talking about um [noise] I'm protecting your assets because someone got sick in a nursing home might be needed it's all these different situations and challenges that we have in life and um you just want to make sure you were when you make that decision that you've done your due diligence\nAnd you're going with the person you feel comfortable with mhm\nSo I did have you know again I'm picking your brain's because people are asking me questions even though they come into the radio station but you know I was I'm emailing back and forth with a colleague\nAnd who was saying I talked to a professional and they were saying something that sounded different than what you that what you and I were talking about when you are you know and the sandwich generation we're all like okay you got the kid and you got the elderly parents and\nThis person was literally getting advice that said oh your your mom should just gift you her real estate if you want to avoid\nYou know um if you want to save the house from her ever having to go into a nursing home and I'm like that does not sound right\nWhat do you mean just just like gifted person yeah directly gift like here here's your house here he's the ... name\nRight so can you explain that and why 'cause from our conversations I was like I really think that that's not the right thing to\nDo well my first piece of advice for these you know seek a qualified all our estate planning attorney but did you say they went to an James and it was led led rising right we're not attorneys here but I mean we've been [noise]\nUm you know dealing with this type says these types of situation with our clients service since we've been in business sign a we've always\nConsulted with attorneys all our estate planning attorneys and you know part of the whole plan I we do for our clients\nIs you know part of the plan is the estate planning they ask for protection planning of somebody becomes ill and we go over all of that how do you avoid probate how do you provide just to be some rules how do you keep assets and the blood line if your children get divorced and all of these other items and that usually incorporates um\nYou know a state planning strategies and legal documents trust and wells and powers of attorney health care proxies and\nGifting strategy you talked about Joni and um again we're not attorney so we discuss all this and recommend um that they seek out an attorney to get these documents done for the uh\nFor the benefits that there are looking for but um that I say is if if our clients do not have an attorney\nThere's attorneys that we've known for many years and all they do is a state planning another large wedding that we refer them to when they can even visit them read it at our office so they kinda get everything done you know under one roof but they have they don't work with us they would just wait for them to them but it's kind of nice to know that um you know it's kind of the professional team\nAnd we also have you know CPAs we can refer them to basically any any area life and the financial world we can you know at least I'm guide them [noise]\nBut anyways with that situation I'm In all my experience is you really I I don't see a good reason to just gift or a change the ... directly to a child because what happens is\nA couple of things that's where we say homespun solution just can you know create bad results when you just gift and asked her to a child like real estate or even stock to things happen is you know you're doing that to protect from your risk like say oh if I go in a nursing home they're going to take a ... gift it\nThen it's not mine well that's true there is what they call a five year period a fabulous back before it's totally protected\nBut you just added all of your child to risk what if your child goes bankrupt goes in business and goes bankrupt what a child gets divorced what is your child gets sued\nYour house is now in your child's name you're you're taking on all his or her rescue could lose out that way [noise] um yeah and it's even it could be worse for the child because when you inherit an asset", "show_name": "Family Financial Focus with Paul Welch & Larry Welch from 93
