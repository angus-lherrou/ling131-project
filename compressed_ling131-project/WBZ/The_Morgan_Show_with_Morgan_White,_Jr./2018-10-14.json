to do\nAnd they're going to end\nUp a ... to me I Know about that\nWe're going to get the phone lines just a moment and a a a better new report you going to be up next before do that I just wanted to get a further ... sort of Greece's gets here and let you know that the majority of the disciples or just popping up everywhere this was recently in the Washington Post\nMy daughter wants an iPhones using the ninth grade so I Believe her when she says but mom everybody has one accept me the thing is I don't want her to have one I strictly regulate electronics in our household and I do not want her ... using the Internet without permission or going on social media\nI Believe in these rules to protect her socially emotionally mentally an even physically\nShe has a flip phone that you can use to call me my husband or the police\nShould I worry about her not fitting in with everyone else am I making her a target if I Am that defeat some of the purposes of denying the iPhone\nAnd the Washington Post experts I'm not going to go to a big article it may be worth\nYour while to get up and I'm just going to touch on the the initial response\nEvery family has the right to create the rules they feel are appropriate for their specific needs if you feel confused about what you should or shouldn't be doing trust me you're not alone there's nothing more bewildering the trying to figure out when to give your child or smartphone\nWhen you hand your child while you were handing them the world of the Internet the good the bad and the ugly and when you begin to think of all the information images of building on the Internet is easy to fall into a fear driven anxious spin out\nIt doesn't help the doctors in tech experts cannot seem to agree on when children should use smartphones but practically everyone agrees on this the younger the child the fewer devices they should have\nAnd the last time they should spend all the devices a young brain is to malleable to him a chore into usually addicted to the stimuli the tech provides and the longer we can hold off smartphones the more time we give the brain to grow in the tour and then the articles goes on and on after that but I figured\nThat in a nutshell um it and I mean there's a good way drawing you know that they they they drink the Kool Aid early early\nAnd you know what and I really I get this question all the time from parents and uh they don't want the kids to have them and\nI mean this is just a comment and such a common thing and people want it the prescription what do we do about this number one parents parent by consensus\nAnd I'm always trying to get parents to say listen you know if my daughter your daughter your son if we have five of the kids and we do agree as parents that were just not going to do it because of all these reasons\nThen we just have to stick together the problem is if\nYour kid is the only one than it is harder but I can tell you from an outlier because you know it's like when you just have the information in front of you it's really hard to hand your kids some\nThings that you just know isn't good for them and so because I just had the advantage of knowing\nThat when my kid was in middle school\nI was like yeah it's not going to happen and my son did not get\nA smartphone and think until he was he just turn he's Twenty one um [noise] until he was twenty and he just got ... when he was Nineteen and was on a college campus and so\n... and and then we just recently just at our our first podcast and what was the very interesting is we had a lot of we had all with all college kids and a couple of the college kids that were participating in the um podcast or kids my son grow\nUp with or that knew me you know from and all of them were\nSeeing the same thing they were like we remember when you were doing that\nAnd I wish my mom had down on you know I mean I had you know let me ... it'd\nBe slipping a call ... or top of the hour here to adjoining because we it's perfectly on topic with this with Patti new reporters been waiting for a while my wife and I ...\nI think they are they selling corn I correct color where at one at all wearing take on that show growing up wired and\nAs I get a kid and like talk about ... and all that they are going on what they call it ... and\nI agree that the current acting get together so they kick a fatal doubt it I guess I I cannot imagine on glass grown up in a day where they or party line\n[laughter] yeah that's right oh people remember ... it is a it's it's just an awful lot for kids to to juggle for any number of reasons as well to win\nIt it's hard I mean and the and the problem is that the kids are all going to be better wired into all this stuff and the parents are um you know I\nJust I just you know what just throw one thing in because I hear the term kids all the time kids will say over and over I Wish I grew up in my parents' generation while my parents all the time we had it harder and parents are saying I Would not want to be a kid today\nSo honored thing is we know it's a problem now let's move to action we've been saying it too long let's take some action here\nAnd I saw what kill girls talking to each other\n[laughter] I laughed payments that shouldn't be out of the normal Patty but sometimes it is now\nBut when they make a lot of lives they were on trial yeah they all put their own and now let's LAX okay at ... can't swear they battle but to another call\nAnd find out I ... that never occurred to me that it's just like when I went to we might not even sure\nNot anymore to have seen so\nMuch that they have to navigate that taught to exhausting them and so with every interaction with every text with every posting it who's going to see this as just one gonna be mad at me because I said it's just like this non stop\nMental navigation that never quiet\nAnd that's what that's what's giving them the anxiety because it's it's not that I mean the technology of the older one thing but the peer pressure that need to connect the need to bond with the need to be accepted all of those things in the most critical developmental time if\nThis is what is straining them so much\nAnd my guess is is also a domino effect here generally because\nAs you said there they've got the phone and with the midnight last thing they're doing is is checking the message is going on line getting as many likes and dislikes as they can\nThe blue light now they she is the the it's been just average dancing in numerous studies the blue light prevents people from falling asleep in an ongoing problem now with kids to sleep deprivation which I think in part not exclusively that would be a little extreme but in part now one of the uh one of the ripple effects of this is\nKids being sleep deprived out of their minds because there are ... with a cell phones\nReading that they should they go yeah relaxing\nThere you have a you know better you hate to do this I got to take a break for news in about twenty seconds what like what what makes me feel better about maybe the kids getting back to the old ways is\nVinyl is back invoke again the kid so maybe there's still hope their patio electrical thanks for calling we're going to take a quick break for news or you can see a little while longer Joni huh I have\nOne more story to share with you and it's something else I Know you know all too well from phones WDC everybody\nWhen our family struggled with our son substance use we were scared and didn't know where to turn but there is hope in families can he'll just like we did to connect with a trained parents specialist who can offer guidance and support for families in Massachusetts\nCall our toll free parents help line at one eighty four four three one nine five nine

Center for addiction at Boston medical center\nW visa WXXI ... to mid and I have a radio station\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio ten thirty with a new one another's [noise]\nAt this age and they want to be light and then they do and then you know and that explodes and\nYou know the basic human one on one if we can jets really understand that human one on one emotions outweigh lied checked every time and there is no nobody more\nDramatic and emotional and hormonal than young people\nI think the way the Bible what's what is the hardest treacherous [laughter] it is\nBut the problem is we keep you know yelling at kids going what were you thinking well they weren't thinking they were feeling\nAnd so if we don't get to the core and say let's understand that first of all I'm we're never going to get anywhere the second thing is all the surveys are saying that\nWhen um [noise] the parents are checking the kids don't well number one like you know kids can hide stuff behind these stealth at\nAll the time your kid is going to be like you know ten steps ahead of you every time I'm ... the problem is kids are not talking to their parents about what's happening in school because they're they say my parent will overreact and they will take the phone away and\nSo what's happening is because we're not educating people because we're not saying this is this is the protocol parents don't have any protocol kids don't have any protocol what do you do when somebody sends you a new picture you're not going to tell your mom because you don't want to get the kid in trouble\nAnd so what we're trying to do is to elevate the conversation is to be able to talk to the parents to say here this is what we can do about this um we can overreact these are the conversation started that we have to have\nYou know forever everyone's always like well you know let's start the conversation well how we can resolve a problem if we can't even start the conversation\nIt's early in this in the in the article which is I think ah yeah CBS out of CBS New York school officials say\nThat they have been teaching students the proper uses for social media but the urge parents and guardians\nTo take an active role in monitoring monitoring their children's phones that use\nIt and you know there's just that there are no shortcuts they're they're just no shortcuts there and that that is part of the issue and I think parents are even more confused about the phones apps and in in the like and a sadly that can't be a while you know I think that's\nA lot I think that's a lot to ask a parents you know it's very easy just to say okay here's what the parents need to do\nThe the problem is that again the kids are always a hundred steps ahead of parents\nIn regards checking your phone then you have to really start asking well what does that do with the trust issue um ... if you know if it and if it works and again I never tell parents you know how to parent if it's working in your home and you feel like you know your own family culture\nThat's one thing but I just worry that it might just be causing a false floor that parents are going all I check my my kids okay and they might literally be missing some major damage that's happening because they're not going to see it\nYeah the cell phones now make it very easy for kids to lead a double life if they choose yeah if they choose yeah\nJohnny ... at the time always just flies by a they have more to talk about we will do this again in any time there's going to be something that's come down to come up it's going to slap me in in the face like a caught fish and I'm going to say oh I got a good job you back on TALK about this but I I was just thinking\nUm you probably have never said or thought of even let false more often in your life\nThen you have in the last six you\nKnow what it's so funny I I I been doing a lot with the French I'm a scenarios and I'm working with a wonderful educator Jacques bird do who are here and I are on that hadn't been on the same level so um he's a fabulous\nEducator and we kinda came to the same conclusions and so we're back and forth all the time so I'm Lewis I\nWish I wish the states would you know um there's a lot we can do so again um if anyone is interested we've got a the screen time Action Network we've got media literacy now\nThere are so many ways to get involved and so thank you for the opportunity again day and I really appreciate it\nWell I I was I think it's an important topic and I and if it continues to to make news in to generate responses and uh you know once again the French are on the cutting edge go figure out a honey before I let you go Joni a Web site Twitter feeds whatever you want people to know\nJust no app for life dot com just sent me an email call me or if you want to get involved and we've got a weapon are on Monday at seven thirty it's the um\nLet

starts at seven thirty\nWere going to do a quick little intro we're going to do twenty six minutes of the film and then we're going to get these conversation started between parents educators\nAnd um

I never really came up against anything horrible going out\nThat's nice to hear for change do you like the sort of things that you are seeing out there now and yeah I it's been fascinating to me um and I didn't have an explanation\nWith all of the all the all of what is going on out there that's far it seems kind of like going through some of my head now the music industry is mostly untouched by it all\nI Do I touched by the meat the meat the me too movement an evening where you don't feel that um you know ... have come out and spoke yeah I mean as\nPeople are being called out for their outrageous and inappropriate behavior and the like this far I haven't heard a lot with the news it gives you an I'm not interested in a way for a moment it didn't happen but it's just\nYou know we didn't happen oh yeah I really have that all the time you saw an ice aren't\nWe all saw it but it's just interesting to me that you're not that that doesn't seem to be popping up very much yet\n[noise] yeah I you know again I I think for people um it's probably hard to come out and speak about that show um\nYou know some people might not want to go there and if they're still in the industry they might not want to go there\nNow and you're ... you're right it could be even it could be just that simple but it's just something that intrigued me you see in television and movies you seeing it in a theater in the ... this far is not so much in the recording industry as\nAs it were and I would just intrigued me but it could be just for the\nReason ... yeah you're right you're right you know you don't know what can happen Tamara game yeah you're correct\nAnd and uh well sadly maybe that people have been intimidated with what's been going on of late too but that's a conversation for another time if possible can we do this I'd like to talk about the exhibit a right up until news and when we come back if he can stay for a few more minutes I Want to talk about some of your favorite artists and maybe you're a desert island disks and that kind of thing doable\nOkay sure let's talk again once more about the the photo exhibit\nOkay it's that goes out of ... a basement archives fall in line at five forty five Washington street inland it's open Sunday which is a few hours when you wake up from one to five and next Saturday and Sunday from one to five ... there'll be other shows coming down the line this is just by ...\nThat's about to say volume on there's more coming\nThe great photos it is a terrific thing to do whether you're a music fan or a just a a photo gallery fan either reason there's enough going on there for you to take it in some by all means do that we're going to take a break for news and they will continue the conversation with Julie creamy here at W.

I\n... you can't make this stuff up just like you're talking to the stores are certain things you you just cannot make up that I think is the is the beauty of that the\nThat that's silly industry that is is paid both of our bills are so very very long\nA promise to let you go on a few minutes I Want to talk about maybe favorite honors a desert island discs if I can do that this was a lot of fun Julie 'cause I'm going to ask you the questions that people always ask me as a as a rock critic and I I never had the answers there were just so many things so I don't know if that's going to be the same with you or not\nThey always say well what was the best cause your went to and I said do you know many thousands of concerts I've been to you know did you ever do you ever try and count them how many you've been to\nI Know because back in the day I was out five six nights as you probably too and I was never one of those people could keep all of my dubs because they were just too many\nYou know I kept some of them and some of the passes and things like that only because I couldn't be bothered to show them away and um so you maybe there'll be some of historic value at one point I Try to estimate just all the way you did okay how many years that I work as a writer how many did I go to an hour and I I figure probably maybe somewhere around four or five thousand\nEasy yeah yeah I think\nI mean just think about it because you would go see a local band that counts right judge evening concert\nCano no no no if you went to the rap or are you went to the ... wherever you might have gone account sure\nParadise yes oh yeah yeah so you're out all the time yeah like you can remember back in the day we had a lot of clubs in this town yes ... can't tones ride spin axis and Venus de Milo that channel you could go out they were banned every single night there was someone to say\nAnd sometimes we'd go to church every other night and you know one\nBack in the gay band like try and old positive they were showing up those big club there were so all the local bands who are doing great\nNo no there was there was there was just a a remarkable scene at the at that point in time [noise] so that'd be in the case to ask you about some of the ... most memorable concerts is is almost an impossible task but hey it's fun to ask you that as opposed to being asked myself because I I always change you know\nThey weren't going to church that I went to like\nBack in the day I saw Peter Gabriel\nOr fee in theater I was like in the third row and he was singing layer hands on me walking on the crowd ... on the chairs of the couch and and it was like it was so God like it was insane like and when you have moments at concerts yeah you'll never forget you know that was like a moment\nJulie that's so amazing because I I often tell people that I said I I don't think in terms of entire concerts I think of particular moments or segments of show social things that come to mind humans\nYeah it and he will never forget\nYeah I I I'll always remember watching you spoke about um earlier at down at a great woods or we used to call it a big value their Harold\nI'm a Brian Ferry\nDoing a I'm a jealous guy doing John Lennon jealous guy just sitting there with his hands on pockets whistling as he's walking across the stage and it was just it was just so riveting\nTo be able to come in that way uh and and they're always just these little moments almost these little vignettes\nThat they will never forget that are in your brain you know like I couldn't tell you what the play list was or ... or the other but I can tell you about being at a certain place and having the experience that are in that [noise] you know that's what I can I can only remember so much out of four or five thousand concerts right I remember a\nPeter towns in when he was touring solo not what the who were touring so low when he was again denigrate woods as it turns out ironically but\nUh there was some sound them\nIs function things were going well there was a technical snafu in and towns and always had a short fuse anyway so he just\nHe just broke set list and and just did this furious angry like Fifteen minute grading version of magic bus spectacular and and you know it was around and you know I'm a ... and again I'm sure you've got similar snapshots as well to others would come to mind\n[noise] uh being at the channel for the cramped ... and ... and they let us dance on the bar\nA like you like that was back in the day when you can jump in a bar and go crazy up um and not be ... yeah I Am not get hurt at all um you know probably um\nAnd that ain't no contest at all he's gone and\nThat seems to have been exactly the case but you know\nJust about what do you think you've heard or seen or read everything that could possibly go on and rock and roll there's always another chapter and leave it to Lindsey who was always been a little predictable and plenty\nThat some might say you dropped me huh\nYou didn't want to keep me in the band anymore huh I'm soon you for twelve million bucks I have a feeling it's not to go to a very long but ah all that I Love you

right now it is thirty nine degrees in Nashua forty Jamaica Plain and forty two and having to before the break I mentioned that Lindsay Buckingham\nLongtime Fleetwood Mac guitarist singer songwriter and troublemaker a\nAt a decided that he is suing the band for twelve billion dollars because they as he said dismissed him and they said he didn't want a tour and we needed a tour so we've replaced him in any way he is suing the\nBand because he dropped him and it it just made me think uh imagine if\nThe same sort of logic was supplied and various other ways I\nThink a for instance do you mean singles why not sued the state of Massachusetts because he didn't elect them lieutenant governor\nOr imagined the Supremes suing Diana Ross because she decided to go off in her own do ... kind of like the opposite of sub situation and goodness gracious if Buckingham thinks he's old twelve million dollars because he didn't go on a single stinking tour with Fleetwood Mac\nWhat about poor ... best the guy who was a drummer and the Beatles before they said and uh I think we'd like Rene go a little\nThan I was just funny just funny just amusing and funny in the sort of not ha ha kind of way\nAll right let's see what oh\nLet's let's do this now for male maybe for the better part of the hour that's left here as they want to keep it a musical theme\nAnd now I'm going to need your help number six one seven to five or\nTen thirty again six one seven to five or ten thirty or\nEight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty the toll free number eight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty I recently\nCame across the twenty five best selling albums of all time\nWe're not talking downloads we're talking albums you know whether it may be CDs or or vinyl most of them are a boomer or genetic sex I think is a good way to put it I was stunned\nBy some of the albums that need the list and I was stunned that where some of the albums were on the list don't look it up on Google lip it takes all the fun out of it a\nTry guessing what do you think albums what albums would be on the twenty five best selling albums of all time you're going to be some obvious ones\nBut there are few I said are you kidding really what's wrong with people and then there were a few others\nThat I thought would be on the list but I was sort of surprised that some of the X. an artist that's rated higher on it so take a shot couple of choices\nOr one choice or whatever you think the twenty five ... best selling albums\n\nDon't just listen cone and contribute six one seven to five or ten thirty four eighty to ... this is we can live on ... news radio ten thirty\n\nTo fifty it's still forty four degrees outside and we're coming down the home stretch in another direction and we can lie we thought we would end on a fun note\nThe twenty five best selling albums of all time what albums do you think Iran it where do you think they are uh you know I I'm I made my living on music for a great number of years and still continue to be immersed in it to a certain degree and other things when this made me say\nHuh really so I'll give it a shot will have fun with this I just know we're going to start with Luke in Delaware and uh I mean look how are you today\nA good deal\nI'm doing All right I think I'm going to have fun with this I had fun putting it together and I I think we're going to have fun trying to go through the list there are going to be alone rises here you're going to be scratching your head over some of these things\nBut it's interesting to me too and I can't even get to a fairly short are there and then two I'm curious about it sure was killed on shore right up there for all er and rumors\nA top five both of them they might be a yeah\nI was going to say a thriller is number one\nI knew that the right up there ... seven million are hard to have at this point Nolan has also the Michael Jackson yet\nIn turn them in ... a paltry it was a paltry a paltry twenty seven million copies compare to thriller ... number one and you've got number seven not a bad start ludicrous\nAnd the two I'm curious about the ... are in their ... sergeant covers\nYep and and this is one of the surprises for me you know it was such a peppers and list twenty five\nYeah\nThere were twenty four albums that sold more than sergeant peppers I this is stunning to me uh Eighteen million copies nothing to lose international sales so that kind of like makes things a little different you see some of these are you going to say huh really\nAnd lived possibly the greatest shovel oh it changed everything in a lot they sure did man I'm about that's all a Carole King tapestry I Do not think I Know you just take a quick look they don't show the law and that was for\nIt did but I'm not quite enough I think I'm going to go through this nope not on but you know what there's an example of one that I thought would have been on it and at one time I'm sure it was\nBut one of these on who you're talking to you or your in your view on this earth butler was ridiculous that's a great out it was a great\nThough it is it is and of course as we know great albums don't necessarily resulting sales although she had a good writer ... Diablo so now come along since it's sold more as as the audience increase but you've got three of that's not a bad way to go with you get twenty fifth such as pepper\nAnd number one thriller and number seven rumors there are few here that I if I don't think people are ever going to get a few of these are on here we'll see I may be wrong before the nights over they thanks Luke what kind of care will aware how\nGreat it down to or just a ...

[laughter] but um I was wondering about the voice pet town show it was a great album\nYou know I agree with you and it was no pitched voice on the list I think what happened is they sold a batch way back when uh I Would think even the beach boys greatest hits or something\nNot on the list and not on the list to me and the summer was a good one I think that's the one that had the thirty to thirty two and a cover on that one the surprise me but it's not here\nAnd I enjoy these kinds of things 'cause it ... brain a little bit so uh keep it going I enjoy it\nTax you're going to enjoy as we go through the list thanks very much you got to take a break for new ... that you have to news everybody\nThat we have breaking news you information now coming into our you want to know developing story now regarding it can it do you want to learn an update on the situation retail and did he want us to just ended up being turn on the knowledge turn my mom come on come\nTo the w._b.

mill\nUh yes you are correct and let me see number eleven twenty four million copies\nAll right and how about um Joshua tree by ... to ...\nAnd you know that's not a bad guess John nothing by two was on the list which surprised really I guess people different albums or\nYou know maybe it's maybe it's this you too is a certain generation you know ... more you know a lot of the baby boomers that might have bought some of the beetles or the other stuff um maybe not so much in do you do but that's surprise me maybe they're just spread out to people buying different albums here no you to outlaw exist\nSeems so you'd all the eighties I figured I might be on the well\nI think it was confined maybe two huge sales for a few years and then died out while we talk about it but I'm Talking about who's not on the list use a little clue for people if you're listening what surprised me is there isn't the single Rolling Stones album analyst\nYeah that's a shocker na na na na said I was also a surprise that the eagles or number two and three uh\nYou know I don't mind I shouldn't say I don't mind I like the eagles I don't like him that much [laughter] they're on that ... two and three are good for them but the\nThe greatest hits set up or too but I don't know about ... hung out with the\nMan I'm I was a I I never thought of it I I never filled it out because I ran out of time but I was going to do is a bit one time we were probably doing the future\nShow what song would you retire for a while if you could not the worst song of all time not the songs you never want to hear again maybe the song you should retire for a while and I have a list you know what I'm thinking hotel California might be on that list at this point just\nJust on what they are not really that high or to have it\nYeah exactly just looks just retired for a while put it in a corner no inputs baby in the corner I Know but you can put those songs in the corner for awhile and butt\nHead and come back to it later there yeah but number three in the list what do we know I guess anyway the good stuff gross thanks alright thanks how can I didn't care but\nAgain six one seven to five for ten thirty or eight eight eight nine to nine tend to go to a Christian Randolph has also been waiting for a while how are you\nChris how're you doing man doing All right uh well\nMy shot my shot it that says that comes alive\nPoint that's a good guess and you know what I I didn't realize that at the time that's down the list have sold a Brazilian when it first came out\nBut I guess the owners to\nOr not it's not on the list oh I see a Brazilian when it first came out but I think maybe it was just like ah didn't have legs you know when it came out everyone was buying records at that time bought it and then after that one bought it I guess I'm sure it it was ...\nGood to Peter I'm I I think it kind of ruined his career\n'cause it's great music it's granted I'm actually yeah\nI I think it ruined his career because after that you know people thought of him as a pilot he's he's a fabulous guitars and singer songwriter I just uh you know I was and I play bass\nAnd there's a there's a lot of there's a lot of great baseline Jeanette too but I'm really I'm sure they\nCan I can I tell you a quick story sure you're you're a big fan of you yeah I saw\nAnd and so while I while I like to shake your hand you won't find a bigger demand a trend in may oh really at that knows all bottom I my my quick little story is make it as brief as I I met Jim Mainard is dead al ... oh\nAt my at mama cans and what was it Nineteen Ninety six or something five or something like that when our it's not that bad that you know that club they had\nRight on lands down the street sure yep they play their opening this right\nYes they had a gym manners guitar competition oh that was a that was sponsored by the end of the family when they finally after all these years\nWhen the family finally won the rights over to Jimmy music they were in court battles ever since his death yup they get yeah you so I'm sure you're aware of that\nAre so then uh that's interesting you get a chance to meet his dad though huh pretty cool I ... yeah\nYeah yeah it's very nice very nice man he gave me an autograph gave a show ... shook everybody's hand was polite because everybody was fantastic\nI question and I'll tell you the last the last say ... is that what this strike at a real striking moment for me was well known as a band up there playing a little wing ... can manage to the links are yeah\nAnd ... hours actually Mr Harris ... was just up the next table to me I'm not making this up to and that's where to go out [laughter] and when one male and a salad and quite fantastic that the guy had tears in his eyes\nRan a that's a very emotional very powerful song\nAnd I saw that and I said oh my God set in my final my God it must adage says crank this guy's doing such a beautiful bird and all they don't like it was you know me being a big Jimmy fan of his ah quite as much for me\nYou know it's funny uh there there are so many hundreds songs I like the one I like for the maybe the the the wrong reasons in a way as there is a version live version of all along the watched I think it comes from the Atlanta pop festival\nUh yeah and and\nAnd he starts off and it it just sounds around cake yeah and I love all that goes is I was\nSaying as he's shifted to the U.S and so it's nice to have even Hendricks made some mistakes once in a\nWhile [laughter] we all do I think\nThat only clocks even said I I have that a DVD by the way yeah man the clocks and Billy Cox said I I was I was in the right key I Do it in the right key and I kept looking at a Jimmy and he was looking at me and then Jimmy realized her even though there are okay and then he said it as\nI was going to do it and love the way that he did\nThat I my favorite quote I think about ... I read somewhere as he played delta ... blues music except the delta is run Mars\n[laughter] exactly so\nIt was a phenomenal phenomenal um I think it was fun on a person to a really shy really shy guy you know and and I'm just really didn't ... yeah really low key in Cheyenne and ... but he was really aware of all talented he was to be honest with you I think\nWhat people forget now as they listen to his music and they say hey this is pretty good and he goes you know he was doing this back in the sixties you know there's the old joke some people playing chess while everyone else's playing checkers he was playing the star trek three dimensional chess when\nI was a little like checkers you listen to his stuff now and it's pretty impressive and pretty progressive than you realized holy mackerel he's doing the stuff in the late sixties unbelievable\nFails legal jeopardy is I don't think Michael jeopardy should've could've and now now now that didn't work out a manager there was a bad influence Saddam ... or whatever and I'll just seems to be a story for another day\nAlong British history about that with with managers and a leg but hey good stead of Chris\n... they did do talk a good and call again seen a bit okay by\nSix one seven to five or ten thirty is the number against six one seven to five or ten thirty we'll go to Michael in ... before we take our last break and we get Glen and Steve we'll get you guys both and I promise a Michael how are you tonight\nGreat great legal something was obvious I think I got the um on on that you thought you\nAll the way things are going to have a favorite but like I said well you are\nCorrect of Saturday Night fever numbers sixteen of all time Twenty one million I don't know if I would've guessed that and I don't think that's the ... went on the list but it's up there so uh I think\nI might have a possible and the way it is a white Christmas just going to say\nWell that's a song I don't think it was an album and this is just all I don't yeah I was a\nShow it's idle but Chris any type of Christmas\nAlbum no there is not actually there's no seasonal albums out there that's a that's a good point because you would you would think that that just because a year after year after year who leave that so seasonally albums never wear out but I'm not on here\n... I Wonder if a Elvis because the longevity of shallow I face\nYou know I never thought of that before this Michael there are no Elvis albums here either I think you have Elvis fans and they buy everything you did but I don't think the Elvis fans blend into like the Gen x ers or even\nRight I agree entirely boomers so just like you know you don't really have to own\nSongs on the albums on the list Noel this either ...\nYeah I'm a big stars fan I didn't expect them to be an ... type of case\nAnd I thought maybe ... or something else like that 'cause they fill stadiums yellow but hey you never can tell okay thank you hey good stuff free she ate at ... thank you yeah\nWe're going to last break we come back we'll talk to Glen in Brighton and Steven Kentucky get their own suggestions and we might be able to squeeze in one or two more if you want to be a part of the conversation six one seven to five or ten thirty or eight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty it's W.
