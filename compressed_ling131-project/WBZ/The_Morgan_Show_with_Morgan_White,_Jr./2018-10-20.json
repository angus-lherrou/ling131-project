I got\nI got to his own right up there on our past Saturday I get off on a hot as hell so this guy is a ... all of a sudden he pulls out this little\nCamera I I don't know I think it was a brownie or something like that I you know we're talking Nineteen Seventy to hear her hotel so he goes and goes oh look up on those two thirds of pictures fall and all their hand\nAnd I'd sure great you know I I just you know I gotta I gotta get a ... a beer or whatnot so he ... he puts on the stage\nAnd all of a sudden you know security comes running all over and Leon shakers that don't leave him alone so here I Am with those little camera and I'm taking all these pictures and he was doing I don't know if you remember Leon Russell but like ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... of course I remember\nYeah they would make these fade into the white powder you faces when they did all kinds of farming and everything you know so I took her out geez I don't know I took about at least a dozen shots or what not that great so now here I Am parched enemies got back cop sitting on his piano so I go over and I grabbed the cop\nAnd it was empty and you know I was out of out of shots and everything and I just work my way off the stage but uh you know getting back to in order to do like\n... did you use flash and then when they told me All right uh what'd you do ... I didn't\nKnow I I couldn't I couldn't use slashed I Would use you know the Baptists meeting available try acts and there was a a print film a color print from the code I came out with\nA right around the time I started that was my main stay which was a it say one thousand okay you get to technical um but the other thing was there was a trick I learned which made eight I figured it out early on that had a huge effect on my photography whatever film I was shooting I Would tell the camera that it was twice as fat\nMeaning if it was try acts and it was a four hundred I Would say it was eight hundred they would allow me to use a pastor shutters feed it and what I also discovered was and this was particularly true when I was shooting you were almost always shooting a delight object against the dark background\nMe you know back banned it was not you know every performer you see now has all kinds of lighting rigs and digital boards behind them back man it was almost always the band against a black\nBackground so this would trick the camera into being able to shoot up\nAfter shutter speed because you really did have more light than you were you know then you realize because the the the light meter with the all the black not realizing that the thing you were interested in had plenty of white so I Would I Would do that and that trick worked um and then you had a question about well I'm Sorry you had an oh about flash that was that\nI didn't use a flash as you said\nFor for the reason that you gave with with the with one exception every once in a while a band would come to town that didn't care about taking pictures and so I went to see a band called Bani haves and the wild combo I don't know if anybody remembers them they they Bonnie have a little bit of a career some minor hits and eventually\nJoined um at the other caller was talking about joined other bands as a as a guitar as well I was taking pictures than a club with this huge flash and I remember about two thirds of the way of the show\nThe guitars and the band finally had enough\nAnd walked right over to me and just stood and just stared at me because you know I was just blind date with this because I was so excited that I could use it because you know like I said most of the time\nAlmost always I was smuggling it in and I could not have a you know my equipment discovered so that was one of my view experiences with the flash and\nAnother thing about a flash that I didn't like what you've captured the show again this goes back to where I was shooting from your your flash would create the light\nWould wash out the light that was the was supposed to be the show\nSo you weren't actually seen the show at the performer intended it you were just seeing your flash lighting them up so that was another thing you know one of the great things about the prince photos I was talking about it that they really capture the the spectacular ... prints all his glory and that show how to bury\nThe purple rain tore had a just a tremendous light show that went with it and I was able to capture that\nIf I'd had a flash forget it\nRight because it was pretty much spotlight so to speak back then right but we always shut your camera on a on the fastest shutter speed as possible anyway\nI I Would but remember if you go to high\nYou you'll have been under expos negative\nYou know ... to buy you know if there's not enough like there's not enough white so I Would I Would trick it\nAnd it would give me so I could do it you know instead of doing a thirtieth I could do sixtieth or you know again we're getting a little practical here but um it it allowed me 'cause I I couldn't I did like to shoot anything below thirtieth they would get it would get blurry so um those were the some of the tricks that I use that\nLike I said there were some stocks of film that came out in the early eighties that we're a little faster Kodak was just starting to develop decent high speed a film stocks\nPrice so did you do any digital work now\nI Do I I I most of the people I'm part of the story that I tell them that this was kind of a career I had in the eighties and then I moved on into actually the film business um but I still dabbled in photography and almost everybody I Know who sort of started when I didn't want it to hold out and didn't want to give it to digital we all kind of gave up about two\nThousand and two two thousand and three because boy\nYou know it ... I'm so used to shooting so much so I'd go on vacation every anything I did I come home and I'd I'd spend two to three hundred dollars developing film so got good enough\nYou know suddenly you come home and you're not spending it die you know you plug it into your laptop\nSo I started doing digital and it's so different it's\nYou know first of all I I you know what I Would shoot like like a big show like it was talking about earlier the police chase stadium I Would shoot two to three hundred pictures now you know shoot photographers shoot three thousand pictures in for a song\nYou know your ... year practically filming it\nAnd just pulling out a frame you know at this point um but you know yeah and and I do dabble with it I mean like I said it's nice that it doesn't cost as much and if I go to a concert I definitely will bring a digital camera and it's funny because you know I'll go to a show and not thinking about it all she five hundred pictures you know aren't near it just really\n... you know do this to you but I have to go to news and about twenty seconds for ... there's\nNo problem thanks a lot of guys ... great show very nice talking to you and I talked\nTo answer I Can't make and then disappear so thank you And Julian thank you you tell it around and sell their cars that's coming up next but I Am so happy that you provided a home run for me I don't have you on again before the end of the problem is okay\nOh I Would I Would love to say beyond again and thank you for having me on and yet say Hi to add for me\nOr join you take care news is next\nTwenty Eighteen midterm elections are here and W. because he has you covered nationally and locally from the Senate race and governor's race in Massachusetts for control of the U.S house the twenty eighth team in turn will have a huge impact on every one this is Dan ... joined me for W.

of the books and some of the people that came up in the world of maverick in the world of Perry Mason and empowering and others\nAnd one of the things that we're going to do to add to the show the gentleman who was here during the first hour Julian Stone it sounds like the character Bernie I'm\nWorth versus name cameras for marriage in terms of Eric I'm of the just the stone detective\nOh yeah jet Jesse Stone written by written created by Robert The park or a virus it go I I I have a Robert Parker's story to tell you\nI Want to hear it\nBut before I tell you that I have um a during the cluster you ... you played one of the ... face a feature and Patrick war Britain\nYeah I'm ...\nI Love his ... year like the story I'm at and there's a there's a direct line between a war Burton and Jim garner okay and that um I about ten years ago I was writing for a magazine um uh\nUp in northern California and um I had a chance to interview Patrick for the magazine a news around the time that um [noise]\nRules of engagement the show he did for CBS about ten twelve years ago when I saw a show or like there it was it was a good show\nAnd what I liked the most about it is and you you you could see you can see that he had grown I'm as an actor you know considerably since dawn party and all that kind of stuff right um it it was it he did a lot of reacting\nTo you know David Spade and the other actors on the show yes but he he's reached he had reached the point as an actor where even if the line he has to deliver is not particularly funny he'll delivered and that sort of dynamic deadpan\nYes way that it makes it funnier like like like a ... you know like as we just you know her if you're listening to the course all about you know the forest fire you know you know as far as a way of beer live near the force or\nYou know ... that's that's an ordinary line but he delivers it in such a way that makes you laugh and laugh out loud and I said you know and I as as as you you always try to break the ice with the guest or or or or print interview fan I said and as part of the ice breaking\nAnd I and I and I was ... and I met this when I said this I said\nYou know you've grown so much as an actor you know you ... your your style delivery and your your your way of delivering that Ruy understated humor reminds me so much of general garner in his prime\nAnd he said that's one of the that's the nicest complement anyone has ever given me and\nUh and then he went on to tell me that I you know he went on to say I'm I've been a gym garter found my entire life my mother barber lord worked with Jim and the stage production John of John's loves Mary in the early sixties\nAnd and and and he said to be even putting the same sentence as James Garner that's what I'm going to take to the bank the rest of my life\nI'm going to give you a throwaway line\nBy James Garner and it's just to work and it was in the movie Marlowe Bruce Bruce Lee did that famous leap eight eight feet above marshmallows desk and\nCame out the overhanging right but the bad guys you know you've seen the seeing the ... billion times the bad guys have the gun\nKind of hidden under their jacket and they said to fill a ... played by James Garner car\nThe dogs the trouble us doggy okay\nThat's that's a perfect example of just giving a recognition to some very important to create or the people that don't get the recognition they really deserve and I think that's an excellent for you to do that\nThank you I just wanted to mention that keep it up and then I'm going to\nTurn the TV show TV confidential or anywhere a way that\nIt it's a radio talk show about television uttered several times a week and different stations or to find out how to listen to it didn't have to listen to our archive a previous shows go to TV confidential dot com\nTelevision confidential dot com on the home page will see a a menu you can drop down listen live archives radio station television confidential dot com our guest this weekend is the one and only Robert Wagner\nWhile just for a job and I intend to check that out actually\nWhere it is only one thing I can say to that you'll get this terrific\nI [laughter] I didn't get it but\nIn almost every incarnation of Robert Wagner on T. V. it takes yeah these ... heart to heart yes Iran on the area of Ghana firing on two and a Half Men\nThey work into his dialogue yeah saying that word terrific I watched an old a two and a Half Men today was the first time we were introduced to the character any and you heard him say\nBut he got a way of saying it like nobody else to destroy like catch it like what we're talking about earlier with Patrick war\nBurden and Jim garner he's got that deadpan way of saying that that makes you it makes you laugh out loud it like a ... like Roger Moore had a few of those things you know talking ... right as ... as being a Patrick Robert no I've always loved to Seinfeld I'm\nDoes he have another persona that he acts with other than that party character boy said he uses on a ... or you know all the beer commercials and so forth\nOr use voice but a ... year for many years if I remember correctly and um he's also heard on either Family Guy Bob's burger\nIt was or perhaps that those shows I mean he does he does a lot of the stuff McFarlane shows so uh and and and as we mentioned a little while ago he does all those a public service announcements as the uh for for a ...\n... yeah yeah ... that's where the fuck that's forced the forces forbearance let's hear anything else ...\nYeah and and getting to the judge James Garner things ... who happens to be probably in my cup of three\nTelevision actors of all time um my printer I just wanted to mention according to read it you got a long time ago\nWhich was James Garner is the last uh adult in Hollywood okay you know when when the on her eighties people were taken over breakfast club people\nWhy suture point is okay\nYeah I yeah I I remember I remember a a a headline or whatever and then\nYeah something like that yeah yeah yeah that maybe that was it yes I I totally agree with that and um\nMy final question is you know there's a lot of the Rockford Files and my I think one of the reason there was so great it were were their character actors they just has a mating\nCharacter actors and all you know it just about every episode but are the ones that like the best or Tom cell playing um ...\nYeah and also Dennis dog and who I Believe is not currently under ... yeah ...\nIs a very busy director today but give a he was rich you ... and he got and and they gave him his own spin off color originally as\nA valid question did he did he have it on the show for a while for a while\nYeah it it only around for about five or six weeks I'm all in fact I even I even think if I remember correctly a white I think they ran it in Rockford time slot you know a dry and another area of\nSeventy eight or Seventy nine and a for whatever reason for for whatever reason it didn't go beyond those six shows they brought back to get in for a two part or in the final year\nOf ... a lot of potential at what ... what is it a show run by a as any of the ... were people I Believe the\nOld ... candle created it he may have done or that if I remember correctly or act\nOr in Wayne anything else\nJust going to say and just getting back to quickly Tom ... like I always thought that would have been a brilliant a show with Rockford and land in the same show you know like maverick well as those guys in the same show\nEvery week but you know well ... are up but they are there that\nThat that has potential I'll tell you this and you may already know this but I Love that Lance character who is just well yeah well sell like\n... I mean a ... a ... garner was was one of the show like mentors um especially in and that's and you saw that especially when when he had his own show with magnum he saw how Jim ran the set\nAnd interacted with his crew and took care of the crew and and made everyone feel at ease you know because television to a very difficult um\nWay of 'em in the industry because you got to shoot a lot of pages in a very few number of days and so is it uh it can be very ... and you can get a lot of pressure and notes from the network and this that the other thing and the star sets the tone at the store is cool and laid back\nEverybody else just relax at the stars uptight everyone else becomes uptight showed Selleck saw how Jim conducted themselves\nOn the set and set up professional but easy going tone where people work hard but Jim didn't micromanage and salad practice as a lot of what he learned from Jim to this day\nActual important right wing you're right that you're very much and I'll be getting a book\n... thank you burn right when when wing and Paul\nI I don't want to short shrift you burn\nMaybe we can squeeze you moron and if I have to bring you back um after the news so home burns Paul\nYeah Andrew future parents were appalled for me please\nPong\nWelcome to the w._b.\nMe therefore your voice sorority that over time you ... you mentioned doors but low pay yeah he did Huckleberry Hound any chance he did snuggle with yes\n...
