friends who are listening to and I was flying in ... were a will for his frog bans I guess starting about Nineteen sixty five\nOr six get six to six start getting into bans are still under at Brooklyn high school um\nAnd I was in a band that was trying to play some some booze or\nLate in Nineteen sixty six words some fine musicians from uh the book line area and then I was in a band that was kind of kind of played a little bit of everything was called the free board and very creative musicians who are in that that\nBan that they really are taught me to have\nA open minded\nOpen ears about music\nSounds like they've got a little sector deli in the band with a name like that Bob\nA man she ah\n[laughter] I Do remember [laughter] I Do yes I Do a\nNow are there any idea those guys still making music now any names all or you know reverberate with the music community\n[noise] um well the um\nSeveral young musicians that are from the Boston area or are still there I mean from that particular ban uh there's um\nI didn't lose ... for a while\nUh no they were that they knew each other or get or from that same generation and both a blade in Chicago\nI thought I looked around here at one point or another during that period of time at all I Know I did I thought it was with James but obviously I was mistaken I'm Sorry continue\n... that that is another story that I that that that actually goes into this\nOne real real well while I was a plane was Luther\nAt a place a under the tracks and rocks recalled behind one tap had really blues\nEvery night in there and we would be a success tonight or six days a week or three set matinee on Sunday that's thirty nine set sets for those of mathematically inclined\nThirty nine and a week week and a dental hone your chops huh\nAnd since she said and can make eighty dollars a week doing it I put my day job\n[laughter] uh it's a great blue story ah\nIn in highland tap a one time I got very excited because I saw this guy walks into a bar and ah we sat down there in order to bunch drinks for himself and shot glasses and drank a better was James Caan\nA cotton had played a a a a\nConcert with his band which was pretty well known by that time\nModerate probably a in Cambridge or something and then he came over a tour Luther was playing hung out for a while and uh\nHe um well when he ... he came up and sad and then he just blew the roof off the joy\nUh I don't know how it got so crowded and so fast because people didn't have cell phones but just somehow that place got really full of people and ... driving everybody crazy\nA fabulous and listen to us and\nListen to his band a\nAnd he and his guitar\nPlayers so and he started doing his own songs or me and the other the job player on the band ... mark ... and of course lose or to uh we we knew how to play style of music but at the end of the night\nGot nationally from my phone number and I was just floored\nAnd he just laughed and said well you never know\nAnd it was the first night\nThat I realized that I couldn't possibly\nPlay in the band or somebody that we actually legendary is the first time I ever thought about anything like\nThat at that point you and you figure it out I I might be able to play in the major leagues so\nUh yeah that that's a good way to put a\nA and it was a thrill\nAnd I'm a ... a year and a half later I went to see a muddy at a uh a all small in Boston sure I'd seen him quite a few times or the jazz workshop\nAnd Paul small was bigger bigger ruin the Fred Taylor who's still around Boston are all owned the place and he really brought amazing music to their\nI spend a lot of time in the middle of the rooms Bob I Know it well and you're right\nBoy he brought in all kinds of people there huh man\nYeah one one night when I was playing with Marty ... a year or two later a Wal Mart he was in Paul's small Bob Marley said the jazz workshop\nMercy yeah that that was the kind of great things that used to happen from one room to the other they're so so money was playing at Paul small\nAnd I uh\nI was ... he was my favorite musician and I met him because losers band and sad and like done I guess set with them one time I think a pall mall and a\nBand called the Boston blues band that I was not that people from the Boston area and ... and ... grade harmonica player named ... ... oh yeah\nUh we we had a open shows from ... and\nHe saw that I was trying to play what he called those schools Chicago blues and it was very nice to me about it which was a thrill because that was\nKnow the person that army that he was the\nMost musically influential person that was my favorite and uh so um I made it my business to be down\nThere very very early on the first night or that's engaged and uh they they used to do five or six I'd say well you usually six nights in a club\nAnd move on to another city and play and other such large when people come out every night you know\nI ...

Louis lips and\nWho are known since we were in the second grade together on our member only started taking lessons in fourth grade but he was only a little bit ... uh but uh he was very street wise and I were a lot about music like St Louis lives so now I have a cat that's named after him\nYou know that's an honor you we we we take\nGreat pride in what we name our pets and after whom and why so I'm I'm going to ask you one of the dumb questions because I I guess it's it's required\nThe me to do this [noise] what is it about the blues that makes it so special and unique and\nUm how long lasting ... and ... around I don't think it's going to go anywhere anytime soon what is it about the music that just gets on the people's skin I won't let it go\n\nIt does speak to the common human condition beyond a beyond race and beyond age and be on the musical tastes\nAre we all have blues of feeling in our heart sometimes and lose music expresses it very directly the people that love that kind of music keep it alive even though it's uh\nNot the most commercial music in the world and um\nBut I feel it really brings all kinds of people together the song that I wrote mercy that's on my\nAlbum is about the gaps between people and now there are glowing these days [noise] romantically politically socially economically and its blues about that situation it was a thrill for me to um\nThis last summer ... go to vote to Russia and Ukraine on separate trips and to be able to play those songs for a Russian and the Ukrainian ...\nWow and I'm In awe of\nWell that it was we deem and for me I Hope it was redeeming for some of them and um I think that a music can be a real force for good in the world in a\nProfession that I'm On reserve ugly proud of I think it's a good thing to do for people it's makes them feel good\nEven even a sad song helps people release their own sadness\nSo when you were over the plane to the Russian Ukrainian audience I ... I had this is going to sound awkward did they get it I mean did did the blues come across to them as well because it's not a music that they would normally be exposed to but a lot of times it doesn't matter for every reasons you mentioned\nAh they ah\nThey're they're a blues fans over there and people that here for the first time that just love it and some of them are\nAlready very scholarly with it no more about the history a of the music on most of the musicians to a a a meat and\nAnd some people over there cutting can play it very well uh I I did a go go to rush a few times to play with the band called ladder mayor loosen up from the jumping cats\nAround me over there and play as well and twenties Seventeen and twenty Eighteen and I had a wonderful time colluding with the ladder man\nWhat a great name for a ban oh my goodness gracious\n... and so that leads me to the question now about what is it about Boston and it seems to have a a a thriving blue scene and all and has had for a lot of usa thriving blue seen all out of proportion from what you would expect from a city like Boston\nOr be the balloon seem to appreciate music up there and I remember the the club scene in the sixties and seventies and and the eighties I used to play at a place called the famine broke lying in the eighties oh yeah no it will\nBe on beacon street\nAnd um there's I mean there are plenty of cities that have a special musical character I don't think Boston has any one kind of music that that defines a there is not not like Boston booze sound or anything but many great musicians came out\nOf that area and ah I I really love the place and I will be back again for these days with Tyler\nMars and back yet again with one of my favorite musicians who still lives in the area even though I Believe is from Detroit originally James Montgomery\nAnd we'll be doing a tribute to James Caan with a lot of great our players are at a than arrows in a foul river\nRiver and Fall River ...\nThat that that will be I Believe to I think it's December so December six\nAnd I've had ... and Jimmy on with me a couple of times it's always great to have him on two for well for the same reasons you mentioned ah he he had\nHe had one of the best descriptions of guitarist that I Know of a he was that I won't go into specific names but this is a number of years ago he was ... when I was working as a as an ink stained wretch not not as or not whether it was his army and the radio a\nBob but he was a ... couple of guitar it's pretty well know guys and I bumped into him a few months later and neither of them in the band\nAnd I and I kind of said well what happened in this is so typical of James he said well he said one was crazy and we knew it and the other was crazy and we didn't know it [laughter]\nPerfect\nYeah that is that is a a funny story\nWell he's been around than any man task stick musician R I remember in about Nineteen Seventy one going to a club called is are caught in the summer of ... which was owned by\nJoe ... for a little later I'm at Joe's Joe's plays also in summer or a ... a\nJames ... and his band would ah Larry cars\nWent on guitar and Tom prints bottle on good jar or in there just ripping a place to to pieces\nAnd they had a book club was full of people and they were probably making a thousand dollars at night\nWhich is actually decent money for a I'm a blues band now and I'm good money then about ...

new stories see other kinds of news stories the fun ones the goofy ones the dumb ones as I say I always time of the Web so you don't have to waste as much time on the Web and then after three three o'clock hour we're going to move into a topic where I'm looking forward\nTo engaging with you the savvy WB Z listen there I think you're going to enjoy that topic and I and in a safe until after three o'clock hour but it's something I think that will certainly\nCertainly\nA arouse your curiosity and get you involved but I mean time a few stories here and there ... you get all of this sometimes you just can't be real life\nUh here's the story of this sounds like something straight out of a goofy military comedy but it's real a Belgian technician accidently set off the canon of a military plane dream maintenance which shot another plane in that play and blow up damaging the initial playing in the process\nTalk about a bad day wow\nAnd you think you had a bad day at the office I just hope they don't feel him for the damages because well I as he bordered by aviation twenty four the events took place at the floor an airbase in October eleventh a bunch of planes are being service some hitting offer a training mission\nThat technician in one of the F. sixteens accidentally hit the big red button activated six barrel Vulcan M. sixteen cannon six barrels we're not fooling around when you get that button\nPresumably before he even had time to other oh no another F. sixteen had burst into flames [laughter] oh boy they just wanted recently been fueled for a training run and yes the bullets hit the gas tank groups\n[noise] what's the old line from that old ... the terrific comedy series a second city TV that\nHe blew up good he blew up ... good they're sixteen filled with gas hit with a lot of bullets were Balkan Kennan boom\nThe article goes on to say and because the world is cruel to blast from the exploding F. sixteen also impact of the plane that delivered the shots\n\nAre unfortunately a couple of technicians were injured during the blast as well but it doesn't seem to have been serious injuries thankfully\n[noise] uh the Belgian aviation safety director it as open investigation and see what exactly they can do to make sure something like this doesn't possibly happen again I'm guessing no matter what they try and say and do or even if they do nothing something like that he's never going to happen again anyway [laughter]\nSo technician accidentally sets off again and again that's sixteen and then blows up another F. sixteen and damages the original a plane in the process\nI'm thinking [noise] several million dollar price tag in damages ah right now the story that they came across my desk regarding all of us with our pets [noise]\nYou know there's not enough pressure on us and the day to day basis as it is we have to start considering these things as well [noise] ah dogs might get depressed when owners overuse smartphones according to a new study so dogs may become more anxious and possibly suffer from depression when their owners overuse their smartphones\nA recent study focused on how welcoming a pet specifically a dog could help people suffering from suffering for mental health issues in the leg but researchers also learn that dogs may suffer from depression when they're human handlers ignore them\nTalk to pressure so that does that mean we have now dog medicine for ... depression it's ... there's just no end of the stuff\nOf Philadelphia vet said he's seeing the effects of smartphone users junk pets dogs are very good at reading are subtle cues\nHere's a call from that vet dogs do read body language they read our eye contact the read our facial expressions so we're on the phone and acting just interested in looking for attention it basically is ignoring your dog and the dog ends up getting depressed\nAnd you know what else also really gets the dog depressed\nNot only when people are on their cell phones but when they take the cell phone and said what Lucia good boy who's a good boy that's a long way to go for cheap joke machines that the the bottom line is on that is true of\nOur dogs could possibly get depressed if we ignore them and spend too much time on the phone\nA couple more things before it gets top of the hour and this one actually has has a local angle I've actually been been following the
