we've got about eight nine minutes left with our guest Ryan Maloney and Randall bird the co host of the podcast it's the liquor talking there's so much to glean from this in terms of an historical perspective in terms of a business opportunity in terms of being a better informed educated consumer\nAre you guys have talked to me before about blending your own barrels where you go and visit distilled or whatever type of liquor and say I want a little bit of this and a little bit of that in Egypt overtime and come up with something new well you know there's the thing was we really started\nStarted a that was one of the trans was picking your own barrel\nAnd we started actually got in on that right at the ground level take take it back a step so picking a barrel in general would mean what we would go down to do you go down to this jewelry\nWe would actually go through the warehouse would actually drill into barrels we are and and they say hey we've I like this one case it's you know it's like when you want a ... a barrel now he's on the restaurant and you see that the lobsters and go I Want that one side of the same thing and they would they would do is they would take that barrel down they would bottle it up for us they put a label indicating that we picked it\nAnd they ship it to the store and we would sell it as our barrel ... so it's usually a little bit off\nA of what the ordinary a whiskey that was available at the time 'cause usually those were batches this was a single barrel whenever we could we get it on ... filter will get his cash strength\nWhenever we cut now you go into a lot of liquor stores now you'll see single barrels you'll see people doing is usually who's doing the barrel is one did now you can get the stellar mass and just sort of self will pick a battle food for you\nOr or it's the manager this was his first barrel ... so we we used to have been started on this for a\nWhile back that up just a little bit at a time when people weren't buying whiskey distilleries were happy to sell you a whole barrel\nBecause normally a liquor store might move to cases a year but when you buy the whole barrel you're moving dozens of cases not forty what happening in time as whiskey increased and being very popular and very much of a trend or a fad\nEverybody started trying to have their own barrel so we kinda got in probably the ground floor\nNow there are a lot of people picking it and so the question is how can we continue to innovate and the space that has now become crowded with every store happy to have their own barrel so that they could say they have their own barrel we think we do a pretty good job at it a lot of magazines and people that write and read it highly rated a review our stuff very highly\nBut we just recently did a project in Maryland where we were doing marriage of barrels and this is a concept where you do a microbe after a small batch of barrels\nThat you are combining together uh in order to make not just a single barrel but a few barrels credit fuse together that that's what you're going to put on your\nShow so we're the only for a very specific taste that he wanted to achieve\nSo with sagging we did it down in Maryland with sagging more spirits we did a rabbi and basically we took two barrels\nAnd mix them together to get to a certain way we wanted that to taste did another two barrels of mixed that together so that's ... how combined into two giant barrels and now we put those two together so for barrels to two barrels to one batch\nAnd what we did with sagging more spirits are in the rye was we were able to get that spicy ... front where they finished that was more of a almost like a bourbon or ... or you get started out as the sweet ... side of flavors those banality tones\nSmooth it all out so we were actually able to achieve that\nBy playing with with inside the distillery and playing with ... with these battles to come up with this product and sagging more spirits has got this really cool thing because what they're trying to do and mentally could probably explain it better than I can they're trying to take back the category of ride to Maryland right rye\nCapital of the United states was Maryland that got lost over time and a lot of people just assume that Kentucky makes all the great spirits\nAnd they also lost a lot of horse racing and I think that they're tried to combine those two ah to bring back the pedigree or the heritage of Maryland dry and horse racing they're making a great products\nWhat we wanted to do is we love your great products but how can we\nPut our own unique twist on it and see where we can take it and I think the response from the distillery was like hey can you kind of come down and fork with us on some more projects so that's really exciting for us to do but again the proof is in in whether you like it or not I mean we were talking about how great we are picking this stuff\nBut if they are and you as the consumer or Josh if you're facing this and you say that stuff for me\nThen that really is not\nYou know what matters what matters is your experience or connection\nTo that and and your personal reaction to whatever it is that your body how much you left and right and what's the what's really cool about a sagging more in what I like about what they're doing they're and they're one of the few places that can do it right 'cause they have they took a lot of money and I said make a little money\nThey actually are sourcing the ride that they're doing right now but they have it from a empty pie which is in Indiana some power house he was a story and but what they're doing is they have\nA one mashed bill that's coming from there and then they've worked with them and actually made in the ... we do with the brief\nTime we've got here that they just want to ask you both quicker than ... seconds each the biggest trends thinks people should be looking for are the biggest misnomer about later but it's\nI think the biggest thing you should be looking for is transparency you should know where your product coming from you should know be able to find out as much about the product if somebody's telling you a story they should be able to back it up\nAnd I think that it should be getting off of age statements that's the thing that the that came up in the nineties but bottles of whiskey and spirits that don't have a statement that not mean that they are not going to be good tasting they've gotten so much better at the barrel management and ...\n... it's always a pleasure I always learn so much when I talk to you both both from a historical side from the from an old factory side from taste sight and everything out and bring liquor and he actually [laughter]\nMy thanks to Ryan bologna

Twenty one thousand five hundred [noise]\nAnd the other contestant bit twenty seven six hundred and the the amounts or were such that both contestants missed by five hundred dollars for example yeah\nNo no that's never happened Bob and I wanted that to happen because that would have been very very exciting and and the the people ask me that question than it than they say well what they both get their showcase yes eight votes get their own showcase an added\nAs they say to me what they get it if they win would they win votes showcases if they're under five dollars um and we would say yes we would've given each one bill showcase it would've cost us a\nFortune [laughter] but the publicity that tall but let's say they would have been worth it [laughter] I Would have been on the yes oh yes oh yes\nSir aren't rich I hate to do it but probably sudden you've got a phone call coming your way\nOr get it was great talking to you mark and as always in Roger all the best\nRichard and Richard thank you very much [noise]\nLet's go to George and ...
