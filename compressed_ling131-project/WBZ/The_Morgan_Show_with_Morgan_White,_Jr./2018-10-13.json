what they said I I just come through that it in my own a few showers here and there are high is going to be fifty for Saturday Night the turning out mostly clear in cold it'll be forty three for low

seven in Norwood forty seven degrees in Natick\nSylvia some you wonder if it's worth anything give us a call because Gary Summers of anti drug chilling rex rex collectibles is with a six one seven to five or ten thirty or\nEight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty and ... can be but he has been patiently waiting so Chuck you are up how are you this evening\n[laughter] dean how're you doing\nI'm doing All right you got some but Garry\nDo show I have two items but it's okay I'm\nNot the first item I have\nThe first time I am so my dad grew up in August and he lived next door to ... old drew interesting oh yeah and my dad he has a science stick from joining McKenzie signed by the seventies you Stanley Cup team the game you stick a given and when he got out\nVietnam signed by the old eating\nWild no snow ice okay so that's pretty cool thing I Would say they desire ability why you saw it up there if it's an actual deemed use a all although the pull the non feel how do you prove it blah blah blah that's part of the game but you\nHave to get him off and the authenticity from from Johnny McKenzie and\nYou know great man I Would say for insurance you it's probably in the two to five thousand dollar raise her ensure bingo bingo anyway but the trick\nIs insured in order to get that money you got to have it burn up at a fire that you don't want that but the reality is good you sell it pretty easily probably the one to two thousand dollar range\nOkay I'm In the next item is a game on signed it bother you or Jersey\nAgain back to the world without proof it do you know which game it was used in all that sounds great stuff five hundred to a thousand comfortably\nDown they're both fine go ahead oh about\nMy homeowner's insurance so well\nOn and you know like I said with the stick it five thousand ... the ah the Jersey you're three thousand 'cause burn up in a fire that's all there were things shirts companies can get another one they got a lead to some good money\nSo that ... more than the above your shirt then Gary huh\nWill stick by the whole team yeah and it through you know a lot of Jersey he'll make a lot of the last time the game you six you don't see many of those come out\nI I'm thinking as you know you you you you can swing a possum by the tail without hitting a sports bar these days they ... they would crawl across ground glass to be able to put that under glass in one of their sports bar so I I can only imagine what the market will be never mind the public market just sat alone so\nTerrible with the sports bars there most of that stuff is fake or they don't want it to get stolen it's almost all generic fake stuff so that people would hang would be in somebody's personal collection that would never see the light of day again you know\nThat's what adds value as a photograph or poster it's a generic title admits it you know five or ten dollar Bobby or post or potentially now the autograph is on it it's about a hundred dollars\nSo they are the graphic designer and did you see it signed when you're on the no no no no but it's just a picture of him with this trophies and I told you the size and signed by hand and it says on it photo by Dmitri [noise]\nRight well that might be just what we call a facsimile should get your may not have been signed it versus it might have been printed on there and if it was just printed is a ten dollar posters\nPluck kind of told me that they showed me a picture that they had a hit the actual ... signature and it's exactly what's on the picture that I have\nRight now when it comes to an autograph\nThey print sat picture of an autograph as easily as for anything else\nThe way you know whether it's really signed is if it's signed in a pan you cheat and then they should let the market was signed it a marker you'd see bleed from the ... that would spread through the paper and it's really unfair that cater whether Bobby ... or himself signed it in person\nAnd all said Decatur would compare all of those things are issue a certificate so they charge a hundred dollars just to do the certificate and the problem is is they'll give you a certificate to almost anybody answer to the means almost nothing\nUnless you know when and where it was signed and since you know I'm going to guess that it's probably a printed ... should get your may not be really shy by Bobby Julie signed it to a hundred if it's not really signed it's about ten dollars\nSo Gary I'm surprised that Bobby or an authentic your phone or autograph only goes for about a hundred bucks huh\n[noise] the problem is that you spend a hundred dollars to get a certificate of authentication that it might be worth a little more but bother your so I Do a lot of autographs for a lot of years\nAnd and still doing it huh [noise] excuse me it has all his trophy and met him a collect\nCall it's a common poster it's known a photograph a poster it's just whether the autographs it just is a shy person by Bobby or just printed on there\nI say\nSo it may be duck you are you you hold out for someone you know who's a real serious or Bruins fan or sports fan 'cause it looks like it's a great pitcher I'm not familiar with Dimitri ... are you Gary\nWell again a lot of photographers show I've seen so many pictures of Bobby with his trophies often times to meet you would have been the ah the clubhouse ... shooting so that was the a team at the time and they go through photographers like crazy nowadays\nHow that'll that'll give you an idea don't so if you could be worth a hundred dollars or more or maybe just a nice little keepsake depending on if it's real or not that's that's the trend\nOh All right thank you very very\nWelcome glad you called I Hope we're help a little bit I Know it's not exactly the news you wanted\nTo know better they know ... they can't get very much\nSix one seven to five or ten thirty or eighty nine to nine ten thirty good to Bobby in Boston will go to next season I Bobby\n... just waiting to tactile\nThank you know you don't have to wait any more you hey\nAll right well I'm ... I'm calling about if I have a ... attack at the hotel and the picture I won't let the painting\nNot a painting death and standing on the mountain to New Hampshire a shooting at me\nYeah souvenir us by about\n... ... while I don't yeah I guess a very old\nYes souvenirs like that were made by many manufacturers it is it said do start in the back of it I'm been\nYou know land so white looking um pottery is meant was originally ... made the holiday but everybody started making him after that because it was very popular tourist attractions would\nHave things like this and people in New Hampshire would buy them and sell that let their tourist stops although\nMan gets up there that old man and the kind of fell off the mountain so there is something demand for it but not a huge I Would say in New Hampshire it's going to be ten to Fifteen dollar plate\nOur K ... when I we purchased our own uh my founding painting by Alan Hal I'm Eighteen Ninety One I saw in ... California a mission\n... oh al ... thing in the national and it was a goal goal will tech frame yeah and that's just wanting to know what the value of our day\nSo cool thing about art is it which I Can't it's good art it's got some value at least intrinsically you could like it and see when it comes to artists signed artists it's about the value that their work is selling for in the marketplace which is something to fill out look up\nAnd that's a great kind of a thing there's a big demand in southwest us a there's a huge demand in that time period in southwest start so without being able to give you much more specific information it could be anywhere from five hundred to\nFive thousand dollars a pound\nOf our money\nYeah be worth a lot more than that my ... years ... ... scanners auction galleries scanners are local and they do it three on a certain day you could call them up\nAnd I'll be nice and very knowledgeable about flying arch so I Would recommend making appointment to go see them and have that looked at it they can relate with insurance appraisal but it's like you say it's still worth a lot more you might\nWant to sell it while there's a big demand and it wouldn't be able to get you a good price\nA little information on it she was the daughter at ... at at whatever how\nWas your name again bombing the artist's name\nAllen go jail ha Ali\nI see okay Eleanor and it's interesting how that would\nThat's a kind of thinking research and I'm ... uh most of the research you need to do is in the marketplace like when was the last ... work of hers selling and how much should have felt for and how much demanded the marketplace or it's just like the stock market in some senses\nBecause it's a beautiful work of art it has a sure intrinsic value to everybody but when it comes down to what it value it as a value based show what someone would pay for it and therefore you look at past\nRecords of what prices are averse had sold for and therefore that show you know the price scanner as databases of all these different artwork all these different artists and would be able to give you a really good information he chose to go get it\nBut I mean I just I just did a quick Web search here's this little information she done in Brooklyn at the age of eighty five her works were showing the latter part of the twentieth century early twenty first century and group exhibitions and in Ceylon exhibitions\nAnd in twenty third teams wander a travel prince by Ellen de hail so Iraq were\nEighteen Ninety One that's Nineteen eighty one\nGot away with it for ... yeah she died in eighty five at the age of eighty five I'm trying to think when she when she did she died in Nineteen forty she died in Nineteen forty so with a baby guy five so work has been exhibitions and gallery so they could well be some value there\nWas definitely is\nSo ... very welcome I Wish you well with that they care by an Israeli\nCoaching top of the hour we get done as we go down and get a couple of other calls rather than try to hire you if you're going to hang in there Daniel stay for a few minutes after news and we will make sure we get you in then a six one seven to five or ten thirty is a number eight eight eight nine to nine ten thirty is a number of Gary good about thirty seconds tell us again about the upcoming comic on\nWell I've got my northeast Comic Con coming up November twenty three to twenty five go to the website northeast comic guns dot com if you'd like more information you can get a hold of me at ... at AOL dot com or five oh wait seven eight eight\nFive four seven for if you need to get more information out of the house full of stuff you want to sell or in an appraisal for insurance cyber age seven eight eight\nFive and ... you know we take a break for the news\n\nWhen our family struggled with our son substance use we were scared and didn't know where to turn\nBut there is hope in families can he'll just like we did to connect with a trained parents specialist who can offer guidance and support for families in Massachusetts call our toll free\nParent helpline one each for for three one nine five nine nine nine or visit ... addiction support dot org message from the partnership for drug Free Kids and the ...

thousand dollars yes well I\nGuess I'm not a ever see under Eisenhower\nBut very few of those are available in the marketplace CJD age and so there is a demand for anything a historical military shelf there's a huge demand\nBut does swords and or bayonets at times and other things like that and great value is store go value and and there's a demand for\nThem Eleanor living what else he brought home I was going to ask a flag that meant pride and with the chairman ... a big big red flag but the German swastika on mine\nThose those cells for three to five hundred dollars easily\nSo Illinois he brought the heck is that the flag you\nKnow the flag gifts will go for about five hundred dollars\nSo Eleanor your husband brought these home himself huh\nYes he did and they had so many points he was flown home frequent flyer has made any claim home by he was flown home very nice and he was in the battle of the both when they could not get no surprise into them at all it's very funny or\n... go

hold on to decide what you want to do with and I'm Glad you know well\nWhat we now we don't want to write down what the show I'd like to feel my husband's choice and by the way I had lost my husband he's gone\nTime sorry to hear that it can be Twenty one thousand and five thousand dollars\nAnywhere between one thousand and five thousand dollars is beautiful everybody will come in the house all

married him now we have read him and he had that brought that sword home and I've had it since I married him and now he's gone to its mind\nWell it gives you a little uh you know one of many keepsakes

is about as a\nWarning parents and kids themselves I guess are trying to get the word out\nAbout the dangers smartphones\nThe kids get so addicted to the smartphones that it actually can do them emotional and psychological harm you have to check it every day that don't do live without ever next embed they've got to put so many like San Diego contact with it and the pressure that it builds up and how the kids really are are almost creating the barriers\nBlinders\nAround their lives because of the way the phone dominates their lives to be a hindrance so we're going to have Joni on because it's always good to catch up with her see what's going on end and then a couple of things have come up recently I'm looking forward to talking about you might have noticed the nation\nFrance do perhaps have heard of France uh has banned smartphones in school for students\nThrough the junior high level possibly the high school but I Know at least through the junior high level they have banned cell phones at the schools throughout France a federal\nLaw\nSo I I'm sure that we're going to have some intriguing comments from from Joni about this and maybe that's the beginning of of a good trend that got a couple of other things going to share with her as well too but I'm a kind of lab because of the I Wonder if sometimes people regard to hear like one of those um Old Testament\nProfits repent ... go way what are you talking about oh wait a minute wait a minute it's starting to rain fire insult maybe we should start listening for so long she has been warning or individuals about the the dangerous that\nSmartphones can having children youngsters\nThe pressures would come with those phones and constantly beyond them in responding and this and then the other thing and people may have said oh come on and when you're worrying about who they can get in touch them telling you want to the parents the great thing to heaven and surely there are good things\nThat cell phones accomplish but nevertheless\nAt a young age well kids are still developing it can control their lives sometimes too and I'm healthy degree there was a perfect example an entire nation now it's France I Know I'm just getting a but entire nation this case literally France has banned\nStudents from having smartphones through junior high school\nBecause of the the dangers of the impact that hasn't kids psychologically and emotionally so going to join Leon with us tomorrow night and then later on in the evening it it we have a an all female guests the\nGifts to tomorrow night and it's nice when

been my experience that if anyone has come to this country and they want to spend any time here\nThey're desperate to learn English and in the meantime they have to communicate somehow I don't think they want to keep speaking whatever\nTheir language you might be I think when people get here part of a as part of what they want to do is learn to speak English but I think there's there's such a ...
