everything you hear me\nOkay unbelievable\nUm well I told your producer Andrew there yeah ...\n... producer on WB the by the way followed by abroad Rob Brooks number two\nI I'm not I'm sure that I think Andrew lost weight in gold\nYeah you sure it was a ... well yeah I was telling Andrew the reason I called was I was watching the NBC nightly news today and I got upset about something it showed Milan your Trump over there you know making the rounds in Egypt\nYes and now she is\nShe's been over there all week long\nYeah she's over there you know and I know I don't want anybody to think I'm I'm a ... picker or a troublemaker or anything like that but just just hurt and like you know she was over there\nAnd now today she is she is dressed up or a wearing something sort of a a Indiana Jones out for at Morgan that honestly look look at what cost of the million bucks if not more\nAnd and she always looks like she has modeling for the camera and ah you know and I can't help but think she is because that seems like that's what you're doing it in these these outfits she's wearing or they like just\nTremendously a\nTremendously expensive end of the millions and I want to know\nWho is paying for that you know I don't remember like Miami Eisenhower and best true when you know address on like this and who's paying for these outfits where's this money coming from\nI'm assuming [noise] out of Trump money I'm assuming I don't know but I'm assuming that way\nShe goes in she is representing the United states and\nIs trying to look all pretty that this is coming out of their own personal budget\nI'll tell you what when ... whatever she aware as it sure looks like Trump money I'll tell you that because I remember when Sarah Palin was running\nWhat John John McCain you know as as vice president on the ticket yes\nYou know they started furnishing her with with college that weren't nearly as good looking as Milan your trumps of course and then when you see them and try to make a big deal about it so she decided that were on a call and say to hell with it\nWell when you say they are you talking about the Republican Party or walk boos de ...\nWell I don't know who they were but they weren't making a big issue about her wearing these are these new outfits and Sarah pale and then and you know they didn't come close to what millennia where it's been\nAnd and and then Sara pale and just decided that you know to hell with it I'm just going to wear my own clothes but I make it home you know if they're going to make a big deal about it no I don't know who they were more again but that's the way I remember at one\nPoint she was running mate ticket and then here you have on you over there wearing million dollar outfits are just they're just kind of works
