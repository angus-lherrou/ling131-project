New Hampshire forty four and took spring again fifty degrees in downtown Boston again the name of the documentaries\nOn from the heart is about the life of the late great blues man Paul Butterfield than I Am a stone cold Paul Butterfield fans and it's been a treat to be able to talk to a director and producer John Anderson about\nJohn before the break we we talked about the the Bill Graham quote about if it wasn't for ... a lot of us wouldn't be here today so as we talk about someone who's\nImpacting influenced far exceeded perhaps their record sales\nAnd a a general recognition Paul certainly falls in that category because you can make a case of the whole San Francisco seen the airplane the dead all these other people were so enormously influence when Butterfield came out with Bloomfield doing these ... and you know these round rock songs and the like\nSo his influence really goes far beyond where people expect don't you think\nIt's true and you know you mentioned San Francisco especially it was so true there because when I first got there and sixty five [noise] everybody was there to see any creative station in Chicago so the airplane was there the dead was there [noise] um\nAnd the universal feeling that all these issues issues had was hey man we better get serious about our instruments because these guys can really play and it brought up the level of musicians ship in San Francisco significantly and all over the country\nAnd as we say whether it's the Grateful Dead are so many the bands that came out of San Francisco there's been a great ripple effect here uh I got a chance to talk to them because I was a\nA music writer for a lotta years John I got a chance to talk to them a couple of times uh in one of the things that I remember and it's very interesting because it ties in very closely with the time of the documentary is\nIt is saying that the armonica was perhaps the most personal instrument because it was the one you held closest to you he was the instrument that you held look closest to your body and horn from the heart very much ties in with that doesn't it\nWhere we're having a conversation with John Anderson is the director and producer for the documentary horn from the heart\nYour documentary about the life of the the late great blues man Paul Butterfield are generally been airing it around the country so you've already gotten some feedback in response to what the sort of feedback have you gotten a I'm intrigued if you've gotten feedback from musicians as well\n[noise]\nWell it it had its opening week long run at the ... percent of New York city last week\nA bill for the jazz musician was there a hugely great things to say about this bill you know showed up with Gary Lucas guitarists would be hard and many others\nOverwhelmed with the New York times gave it a critics pick which has really boosted his profile Rolling Stone a beautiful article about it and yesterday the wall Street Journal published it very favorable reduce so thanks to those things were adding three or four hours a day to the schedule\nEvery once in awhile things pop up about Paul and they almost disappear without a trace it always infuriates me or was it last year that\nThey released the album live at the unicorn and it was an album that seemed to did just disappeared without a trace I don't think I read a single review of it\nAnd yeah they're recording qualities so so not great but you know not as bad as a lot of the ... recordings from that era when we're done when people didn't expect to be released\nAnd you have a remarkable especially with the term remarkable playing on it again and nothing no nose and it just infuriates me is I I really\nHope that the the documentary goes a long way towards towards writing that wrong\nA thank you so much great music for people to catch up on your right\nUh I Know I Will already it's it I mean this is just greedy now maybe almost unfair to ask is are you are you looking at the next project\nA course of course a lot of [noise]\nI Do a lot of music docks I work with Brian Wilson him do his work and I've got a couple of Roger which at that and for over Twenty years which is Tiny Tim\nOh my goodness gracious well you know what a a a a\nCultural figure when in you know in his prime that you've got as much attention as anyone else did in a fascinating figure so why not but a\nLot of people that get them as a free flu can I guess he was all those things but it was also\nA music colleges tea also had a beautiful voice of course the shuttle was a gimmick but encyclopedic knowledge of American music and everybody loved him you know the band back them up and you are when you eat\nA loved him and there's a great story entails going out to his house will sixty seven to me down so it's a New Yorker story and that's what it means a lot to me\nDealing in Tiny Tim the mind just boggles at the possibility I Wonder which one seemed weird or to the other John\n[laughter] tiny always a lot of that guy I guess so but that might have been a close second under those circumstances at that time or you\nKnow\nI was just going to talk about now you've done a couple of other documentaries on on the blues blue seeing you did something on on sample a of course who played with Butterfield and there's a veteran Chicago blues man a or what made you dedicate so much of your time is a a documentary artist on the blue scene in Chicago\nIt's just always good to me you know I came here to go to college many years ago immersed in the blue said at a tape recorder recorded a bunch of shows got to know the characters from our perspective that makes sense at all came from the blues but\nYou know now I just can't get away from it there's so many great artists and you know so much ... lotion to be lined in those old records and and talking to those\nArtists and you know I feel like I'm lucky to be in the right time of the right place to be able to talk to them while they're still around to contribute to sell\nYa you you've got to a a definite period of time to get this all done because there aren't a lot of art is left to connect to the classic blues generation with the current one\nSo that people like as you said Nick hurled and bishop to talk to me and those are the guys who were there for a lot of that Steve Miller as well um yeah I Know that that window is closing so\nIf this has already happened forgive me because it must have happened recently 'cause I always check all the time that he will he has family in blues land that the album finally been released on CD yet the one that has Bloomfield all over\nI Do think that is still available again on CD huh no it's a travesty\nHot it is a ... this is this is the stuff that just kills me this is the stuff that that man oh man I\nTell her just today that it's going to be honest\nOh fabulous with really\nGood we will be so now you know maybe that will be in the world needs to get that record because it is so good\nAs we're talking about Butterfield all the things you did you mentioned it being at the last walls of course and doing what mystery train but I'm Talking with Bob marvel and Butterfield also backed Muddy Waters in that performance that just made everyone drop their jaws\nA Margot and was taken great delight and talking about you know Clapton Robby Robin sending all these guys would just ... when money came out and do this thing and part of it was fall back again\nAnd I'm One of the things that Margot and said last night that I pass along John as he said that money often said that he liked the way that Paul played that song that warble behind my voice it was a chord behind my voice and helped hold up my voice\nYeah you're talking to manage blue yeah just chemistry\nYou know do all those all the way at the end of the stage there you know he feels comfortable and they've been friends for years at that point so there was a lot of you know a lot of love going on between them besides just the great news\nI thought that was just interesting you said I Love the way he plays they have something that warm all behind my voice that poured behind my singing it helps a lot of my voice will\nMatter as long as he was playing with somebody had to do is just to and suddenly the group was better suddenly everybody was playing together and that was the magic is energy\nWe haven't talked to John Anderson is the director and producer for the documentary horn from my heart I I'm Sorry I heard from my heart that I got that correct right\n\nFrom the heart I knew I messed it up sergeant horn from the heart which is a documentary on the great blues band Paul Butterfield a spectacular player and performer so if you're into the blues into pop user gr into will make documentaries and I'll check it out it is going to be coming to the region theater on November fifteenth\nAnd there'll be a question and answer session after that the few minutes we have left John thanks for being so generous with your time if you were going to put together your own personal best of Paul Butterfield what would you put on it\n[laughter] I tell you that let me tell people that if they want to keep track of the film let you go from dot com when you've got to start was born in Chicago activists\nNo no no it's ... how could you how could you leave that out\n[laughter] again everything\nThat shit I wouldn't take off of that record screaming also burning Butterfield Bloomfield instrumental\nAlso take from Los Angeles so you can hear what Paul is like as an ensemble because of course I'm way takes the lead on that then you got to go to record the boundaries and not only duration of songs you know was\nThirteen minutes or something and came out sixty six so you know it was probably sixty eight\n\nJust displays wide ranging imagination down then you go into the orange section a glove in my own dream you know not only and again it goes on a day just David shout along so beautifully and also Paul shows\nHis excellent guitar playing on that\nShow John I hate to do this we get about thirty seconds left I Want to make sure you get to talk about um websites Twitter whatever you want people to know\nHorn for the heart dot com Twitter Facebook were there\nIf you are listening to this film was scheduled at a theater near you tell them you want them to be on you want it to be on their schedule on the website that you don't then because this this building from the ground up\nJohn thanks very much for being with us we'll have to do this again soon talk to you soon\nExtreme of I\nThink even though his health is now and what I'm Talking contractors known for building beautiful home was uncompromising every Saturday Night in ... and here's your wisdom on building renovations and might be part of the conversation that you find in the comments\nHad high hard media dot com one seven Seventy seven Seventy one twenty times has any time I mean I Know there may be dumped them\n\nW visa ... WXXI ... two men and I heard radio station\nSo somebody read the entire thing about books well that's pretty interesting if he got through the whole thing there's something there you know so that was something I had set it off to the side while I was working on the the whole grand history project and so\nAll of the books that you've read that are in your library is the nonfiction books right our I'll get that many reviews ... or something\nAnd if I buy a new book and I'm I'm a page twenty five I Can't I Can't write a review I got to wait until him at least a third finished with it so how many books or in books\nI don't know exactly a couple of thousand maybe how man\nA but it it's nice it's got the ... and like everything else I publish it's got that nice fourteenth for lunch it's not it's not big enough to be sixteen which makes it technically large font but everybody but everybody says this is great I Love the ...\nIt's a great fought for the general public to very everybody can read it\nThere's very little out there and fourteen oh you're every everything is eleven five twelve which to me I Need my reading glasses this I can read this in the dark\nYou know so that's that's a big selling point for me and the fact that all of the segment so short no matter what I Do no matter what book I'm reading no matter how much I loved the book I don't like long chapters\nBecause it's after that after a\nWhile it just kind of things just kind of get weighed yelling that ... that are littered up into two as you do you like to like that that are already so we have the the book called books and as you said to the best of your knowledge\nAnd I'm just having fun saying this like the best of your knowledge there's never been a book called books I don't believe before that's why they're so\nHere's a new type of format was changed I've got a\nGood for those of you self published you know that creates space was very popular it's disappeared it's been absorbed by Kendall and you have to learn the new system it was a little intimidating I wasn't sure if I could do it you know and it's just okay with it at some point you just have to learn how to do pay\nYou can graft your old or create space books on to Kendall oh you can start all over\nI'm choosing destroyed all over in order to know that all of the books on Kindle or a graduated improved version and just put so the the the new ones are called the United states and the time of and the ... got a nice\nNicer official look to it so the ones that are if you see usa let me go back a second you gave me some books last time and one of them was this little I actually don't even remember the name of it at the top of New Hampshire there was a little republic\nThere was a whole book about it there's a little Republican what happened was a Canada and the United states had a border dispute over this area at the very top of candidates like most country if you want to see a movie go up there with ... so I'm rusty on it because I haven't looked at the book in a couple of months\nBut it was very interesting because it was a no man's land the people that decided why don't we just start our own country and so for about two or three years there was actually\nThis little tiny country the size of a half a county that was almost on the verge of being recognized until ... and then\nFinally was settled in the United states got the territory but it was getting to the point where Canada in the United states was getting worse if we don't settle this this thing might come into existence as a tiny little like the Vatican city the very very top of New Hampshire [laughter]\nWell you know you still see that attitude today because there are ... parts of Vermont for example that people tell you one like anywhere else in the country like the right the ... the ... as they call it\nI I should mention when my ... books when I used to work at the Boston Herald I was near a a desktop where everybody in the paper would put stuff that they had gotten that they didn't want records books pamphlets ... new whatever people might have gotten promotion earlier when I've been to pass along to them at their old\nWhen they decided okay I didn't want this they would just put it on this desktop that happened to be near me so over the years that I was there I I obviously have a Jones for history and I would I Would get all of these books that were books about anything to do with history was the United states or world history\nOr naval history or wartime history the like thinking that some day I was going to have time to read all the books not knowing that of course I'd be accumulating more books over the years\nSo as I was going through my library of everything that myself I don't know when I'm going to get around to reading these if I give them to MIKE SHE might make better use of them than I ever will last time he was here I did I gave them\nA couple of ...\nLife has these little seminal moments that

I Can't remember who champs who played at the time see I I did it\nSo long ago it was when ... was actually a football powerhouse so you know what we're talking in the middle ages ... and had a decent football team and a lotta years\nYeah they used to be a part of a sudden they like\nI was going into mountain all mode and you know they had on the like fifty percent off track so I picked up a book a Hitler and trend and ah you know talks about you know um gold crumbles in a similar and\nWho's the ... that sounds familiar\nYeah he's from he's from he's from uh\nGermany I yeah I don't have it in front of me but I rarely find fascinating characters and I know you write mostly about American history I Wonder if you could recommend maybe a plan for me to read about the guys he\nJust sounds like a condensed chapters about um you know what I'm saying but boy these characters are really so loyal for Hitler and I really find it fascinating\nWill probably the best to books would be a by the Germans themselves the global diaries was ... and uh what's the other well the memoirs of castle ring is another one and a ... beer\nOkay so okay inside the third Reich by al ... I feel that when the ... and you get for the money when you're reading those guys you're getting inside their heads all day\nAnd there was another like I'll give you a great example I'm I'm reading the global diaries and I don't know what he's ... he's spent the the the fear is really down and I am too was so down\nIt's this is this spring it's it's it's just get it was so depressed and I'm thinking well the war really has these guys down it's it's certainly in the hour we'll do that yeah right now we're this is going and they came reading is over and over and said they were so\nAnd then I realized that starting on me they're talking about the cold weather\n[noise] really\nDry as a page after page the if you're always gets depressed when it's this call yeah guys gotta be kidding me of murdering millions of people and you're feeling sorry for yourself because it's cold you guys are insane that\nI I get blue when it's cloudy [laughter] honest to put a headless feeling though I'm feeling down\nAnd the ... at it but don't that's the type of thing where you ... and here's another one that's interesting to me they had a running problem with the church\nThey that the United states that are running problem with the church the resistance of the church we hear a lot about how the church collaborated I'm not saying anything in defense of the church where it's been proven they did collaborate but the Nazis had their hands full because they knew\nIf they started a resting and shooting priest they would have a backlash on their hands that would be counterproductive so yeah they had to put up with a lot of resistance\nThat they would basically they're warning and he's talking about global ...\nWe sent this priest another warning today but it watch your step and when this war is over will take care of business they kept that was their their plan was like okay we got a big problem in our hand with the church speaking up particularly the Catholic Church this speaking up in the ... we got to do some what do we can't do anything right now we're trying to win a war it's a delicate situation\nThe Germans always had more control over occupied countries\nThan their own yeah being interested because they have an ... for structure they have to respect within Germany whether it's the banks the schools the post office\nThe church you name it there's an established infrastructure so the Nazi regime was an over layer of an established infrastructure but they always knew there was sitting on a powder keg do writing the tiger at home\nIn France or Poland or Denmark or Norway they made all the rules and they didn't have to worry about resistance because resistance meant nothing resistance was futile but resistance in Germany was a serious problem\nNow from what I understand that you talk about that my that the policy was a Catholic Church was not resistance but individual priests and the like had resisted well you know it gives the policy was such that\nThe the ... the Vatican did not did not uh\nOh I Know and then not fight we did not as a woman was mad at me one night about the uh the the pope's a bishop if I Am not denying any of that on it like with all of my books and my friend of mine he's a good writer ... British says you're always fair\nThere you know you criticize people but you're always fear and that's all I'm saying if you wanted me to judge\nAs a totality the record of the church in World War two and Europe I'd say you know see mine is not good at all\nBut is it at a jewel if people react if there was another side to that story even if it's not enough to swing the balance is still should be heard and when you read the Nazis memoirs you realize they got a big problem on their hands and it's running\nAnd it was all even in some of the borderline uh countries we have a problem with the church because we can't just shoot the priest\nYeah that gets the mad yeah that that that would get somebody else we're going to ask you\nWe can ... an army officer that's trying to undermine the we hear he's trying to plot and overthrow of Hitler well you know we can shoot him but we can't shoot a priest cars that now we've got the people rebelling\nYeah they ... they would be someone to answer to and also the at that point perhaps the Vatican would have reacted in a way to so they give you some good ideas Ernie\nAnd Mike I'm I was amazed at how oil they either stop our work to Hitler Hitler basically their God you know what I'm saying\nWell some of them some of them resisted ... in particular and and your ... title and you'll do with a two foot liquors they do anything Hitler said and the other generals resented but the other side to try to be fair having read the memoir some of these guys wrote the memos and then they hang them so but at least they wrote the memos that some of them you know\nSome of them were talking about the allies you know with the El Al I hang them okay I thought you know they did their memoirs and then the\nRight but they in in the only thing they said in their defense which is interesting is that your ... and and in title they both had the same story to tell you know in the early stages of the war we did fight Hitler we screamed and yelled at him and he threatened to have us murdered\nAnd then we try it again and he threatened to have a short and then you reach a point where you just say I'm just better off doing whatever he says at first you know in Nineteen forty forty one I had screaming fights with the guy and the interesting thing about Hitler he allowed people to yell at him this styling was different you couldn't tell you said one word to start when you disappeared\nButts Hitler within his with his his coterie within his group\nHe allowed a lot of people that are really had a was what was a ribbon Trump near the barrel yes Reuben truck near the very end was having a fight with Hitler as soon as late forty four and he got him so angry that Hitler sat down and says ... must never speak to me again like\nMy heart is I'm an old man who knows if he wasn't even manual says you almost killed me\nNow and then as you said eventually they just decided well I'm only going to follow orders you might as well I'm only going to follow orders but windows rama play into all this because he was one of the old time\nGuards so if you want to get about forty five seconds rama is the most overrated general of World War two\nI Can't believe he said that it's an outrageous statement controversy controversy\nIs the most overrated general in the second World War I didn't say he was a bad general I didn't say he wasn't brilliant I didn't say he wasn't a great tactician I didn't say that he didn't have personal great qualities I said he's the most overrated general in the second World War I'll tell you why when we get back\nA ... boy that's about as good AT T's as as we could ask the topic we're we're discussing now\nSix one Seventy five or ten thirty is the number or eight eighty nine to nine ten do you want to be part of the conversation questions comments and the like hey we're always happy to do that right here quick break for the news forty six degrees outside as we can live every once in a couple of minutes\nWhen our family struggled with our son substance use we were scared and didn't know where to turn\nBut there is hope in families can he'll just like we did to connect with a trained parents specialist who can offer guidance and support for families in Massachusetts call our toll free parent helpline at one eight four four three one nine five nine nine nine or visit ... addiction support\nDot org message from the partnership for a drug Free Kids and the great can Center for addiction at Boston medical center\nW Veasey buses WXXI ... two men and I heard radio station\nThis is W.

than\nPerhaps we normally would ask me what I work done today what did you work on today Mike today I was rewriting I have a a book on the great war it's like seven hundred pages I'm busting up interest separate bookseller talking about World War one or what he will do yeah\nSo the book I'm working on right now is I took the first part of that book and I'm turning it into a book called um [noise] the\nHistory of World War one in the year Nineteen fourteen so it's a yearbook same ... with the same thing I did with World War two but this was a striking story I've tried to get to a couple of times it's called the broad fourteens it's something I wrote what the hell is that\nIt's an area in the water in the in the [noise]\nI guess it's the north sea and uh what was its it's October of Nineteen fourteen now the submarine is a new weapon nobody knows\nHow it's going to be used it it's a legend it has it's like you Captain Nemo was underwater huh you know it's like ... so nobody has been thinking very much all of the ... the pre war planning and the naval departments was fighting motor to Peter boats destroyers\nThat wasn't there was no anti submarine plan of any kind on anybody's radar\nSo there's these three ships are sitting around what it was called the ... here and I forget it off and what the other just these three British cruisers their old cruises and their manned by teenagers they're like training cruise oh terrific would possibly go with all of us so they're all sitting\nAround and it's just a normal day and all of a sudden boom boom one of them blows up\nIt's the you Nineteen I think it blows up and but the other two ships they don't know what just happened while one of Russia's towards the ship the other crews are thinking that it hit a mine or had an internal explosion as it gets it gets blown up boom\nCruz is going down Fifteen twenty minutes heavy loss of life now the third ship gets the idea hey wait a minute\nYeah maybe I should do it anyway I'm there\nSo it's ... but you know it ran into the right line of fire at so basically\nThree cruises vanished from the face of the earth in about thirty minutes and suddenly a new world of warfare has opened up but it happened at a place called the broad for teens and most of the victims were about fourteen or Fifteen a very young man\nOr a she said introduced a whole new chapter but the way it happened one so suddenly and no one was thinking about oh and the other thing is\nIt's noteworthy that these ships were warships interestingly there was no thought of using submarines to attack merchant ships for\nThe first several months with the war there wasn't even a thought of it it was considered a moral even the German so we're not going to do that we're not going to attack merchant ships with submarines where ... is a gentleman's was still\nAt there's going to use it's still a gentleman's or they're playing by the\nOnly going to sink we're only going to sink warships now here's what happened what what ruin that plant\nThe Germans had all these raiders all over the the world the end and the ... bird there all day and they were doing a pretty effective job for the first few months of the war these raiders these excellent worship but eventually they all were tracked down and extinguished\nAt that point the Kaiser looks around and says you know I I navy or surface navy we better hold on to it and keep it inside we better keep ... you can't risk it we don't have much left we just have to hold onto it there's a naval philosophy that says if you're the underdog\nYou are in charge of not being sunk ...\nBecause that seems like a a a good course of action generally the in the army in charge of not being sunk sea ray nice idea with the dog or not but the\nArmy doesn't have that that that's a it's a naval viewpoint the army doesn't have that the army doesn't mind say all or nothing would ever happen to you All right because if we get defeated we can scrape up another army\nBut if you're defeated in ... you lose six thirty seven capital shifts you can't create seven more to replace them right so the the the naval attitude the way they taught naval affairs was that if you're out numbered\nYou have two reasons to not go out and fight one you can preserve your capital ships for home defense\nToo when the war ends these are important bargaining chips if if the war ends and your ... renting a negotiating a treaty and you have no navy that might cost you several provinces because everybody knows you have NO NAME but if you have a navy it gives you dignity at the bargaining table so\nFor those two reasons Germany decided late in Nineteen fourteen that you know we have no choice we're going to start torpedo a merchant ships yeah but it sure but at first they had no intention of attacking merchant ships\nAnd uh it's time for the three o'clock news here WB XIV\nGary and we'll bring yeah we'll get to your right after we come
