might you said even better to see Susan I makes me feel bad about myself well or logging on it earlier [laughter]\nEverybody loves Susan Susan how are you in the real this is so exciting for me to make thank you for having me on a great role from time to time we get lucky my only at ... absolutely Susan actually flew\nIn just for this this recording and I'm joking here all the time she was here more and more and it's wonderful to see you\nYank you it's great to be here\nIt's it's such a pleasure ah because we hear the two of you so much I really like this because they were going to be able to get an inside look at Susan your and Sam's relationship because it really is one that goes a long way back and has a lot of history together\nFor sure you know like Susan you and I've known each other for quite some time and after a retired and we started having some fun do some things professionally and and your and my clients and we're having we're having a lot of fun helping people educate people on how to sort of do the right thing as they approach retirement\nShe I was really lucky ... would you do know is that um I grew up in this area and then ... area and hadn't had my career\nYou know my my TV Clear Channel five Boston for like almost thirty six years so even before I knew Sam personally I knew of being in laying and as a consumer reporter I knew a Sam laying in his reputation\nSo I had a very unique opportunity to get to know this guy before I ever knew him personally while so then when I get to me\nHe'll reruns rightly\nOr not to mention his wife and family I mean so this has been a great opportunity for me also because Sam and you know I tell you this all the time and I take you publicly and this is a great opportunity to embarrassment really you know I'm not but it gives me an opportunity to continue doing what I always wanted it always wanted to do make we just help consumers\nAnd now I just have a different platform to do that during the ... ... exactly people\nHelping people Mike as we do every Sunday to into retirement and helping people follow those tools were number one just don't lose the money\nAnd rule number two don't forget role number one that's\nIt that's it so we're going to have some fun today we're going to talk to people a little bit about smart retirement strategies and there's been so many studies out there as you and I both know that\nYou know retirement is harder and harder the others but disappearing of traditional pensions many people I see are concerned about the ability for Social Security to be there to sort of keep the promises to wash\nAnd really when it comes down to a lot of the burden has been now put on the consumer and so you know and and I say this over and over again but it'd be nearing retirement and you know if you're five years away maybe even ten years away\nYour your vision and what you need to do day to day has changed a little bit right 'cause when you're thirty when you're forty it's all about growing money you know it's always about earning more and having more but when you're close to that red zone\nYou have really two jobs the first one is to make sure you don't go back would you don't lose the money following two rules ... chances are that's the most you've ever had right and then the second thing is at some point in the future when you stop working as soon as you can speak to that a little bit\nWhen you stop work and you don't get that paycheck anymore so now you've got to figure out like\nHow am I going to pay my not only am I essential expenses but in my lifestyle ex my everything everything right so you need to create a source of income that reliable sustainable and just pay the bills and we'll talk a little bit about that later on the show we have a great study\nFrom fidelity investments talking about smart retirement income strategy look we'll come back to that but as soon as you know exactly what I'm Talking about\nFrom every possible angle I'll start with my four nieces your late twenties early thirties who are working so hard every day just trying to get by maybe you're more than one job\nBeing sick and they're not thinking about retiring you know they're just thinking about next week month and we talk about this a lot and then I say he kids looking I'm Susie I never really thought about as much as I should have because I had this pension in the back of my mind but I was never talking nobody said to me ...\nKnow what this is what you're going to be thinking nobody said hey this is what you how you mentioned works you just had one nothing nothing I didn't even know how much it was going to be a ham and I mean I just was sort of like leap of faith and then you know um we talk about my mom all the time the amazing ... billion lived to be one of them\nTwo and three years old I measure Hi thank you so she was such a great first a down and she loved you and I think that they that her she would say on the time she would talk about as she talked to you about it than she didn't expect it lived to be a hundred and three first of all second of all she never even thought about what was going to happen in later\nI used to tell the story how she saw the condo agent came into you know several hundred thousand dollars into somebody that's eighty nine years old you're like wow what I got to worry about all the world's\nLeaving it to the kid she added it all set up bank accounts for everybody and then she went to it all the time she was into the nineties it's gone gone wow so luckily I did have a pension and when I retired um was four years ago that's what I said well nobody told me anything and that's why I Love being able to tell people now\nYou've got to do so you got to do something yeah and you know one of the things that I think people as they approach retirement they are very apprehensive about you know making some changes and really it's the time this is the time to do it it's it's not we see people all the time that have\nA bunch of a ... I saw some of the day she's fifty fifty seven fifty eight had like two or three different jobs really doing well and the current current position but she had she said to me I I think I'm I'm okay I got this account here I got that account as an IRA roll over fidelity I got this other account here\nSo my my point to her was listen you've got you got a bunch of accounts that's not the same as having a retirement plan because you're no specific outcome you don't really know what that money is supposed to do I didn't either Zachary so paint might you know what can we possibly seconds talk a little bit about how people can take advantage of our offer\nOf a full blown retirement planning analysis where they can have some time with myself my partner's John and Ryan\nAnd if if it makes some sense and and they have some nice that we can help them with what will really look under the hood Pizza Hut and do a thorough job in analyzing what it is that they need to do and the outcome would be the three sixty five retirement plan where we will give them an hour of our time to make sure that they're on the right track", "show_name": "Just Don\u2019t Lose the Money with Sam Liang", "year": "2018", "city": "Boston", "day": "08"}
