help people you know we had to educate people on\nThe things that need they need to be aware of as they get close to retirement things are available in the market that they're not actually investments and all of those things in a Stanford University study talked about retirement income generator is what we call in the industry ... and if you\nHaven't heard about that stay tuned we'll talk certainly much more about regs\nBut essentially if you think about Iran you help a lot of people a lot of our clients\nDiversify um\nHave an asset allocation as they accumulate money as they as they grow money and you're you're educating them on why they should have money inequities why they should have money and maybe some safe for things\nBut really diversification yeah in same on top of that you need diversification within your retirement income portfolio is that's exactly what race are you know raises an opportunity for people to understand that not only do you have options as the money's going up\nBut as the money that you're taking out you have to have a diversified income sauce so what do we mean by that most people understand Social Security we have it you retire and let's say you have your your essential expenses you housing do you know your real estate taxes maybe your car payment let's say five thousand dollars a month\nAnd your Social Security is four thousand dollars a month between you and your spouse well that will go a long way and you you can count on that you know no matter what you know no matter what happens to the economy that four thousand dollars a month is going to come in where are you going to get the difference where are you going to make up the what we called the income gap\nAnd that's where rabies really come in and it shows you different income sources and that's part of what we try to\nHelp people and educate people with how to diversify their income\nYeah you don't want to have to pull from your portfolio in a day it's down eight hundred points right so you want something that is reliable you don't have to worry about you can sleep at night at the end of the\nDay is really what it comes down to you know the sleep factor having added confidence knowing that you can enjoy retirement without sort of like looking over your shoulder every month where's my money going to come from\nYou know and that's going to be a tough situation you see folks that are in the way you pointed the south's same whether you are just retired or you are in those critical five years out from retirement I mean you see a week\nLike we had where the Dow dropped eight hundred points and you may think okay you know I can maybe you know do okay with that but uh guys I'm thinking if you start to string a couple of those weeks together that's where you really start to get in trouble but you guys have already factor that in with a three sixty five retirement plan\nExactly Mike in in those days are going to happen those or you can't avoid those right you just don't want to be in a position where you really have to worry about it so you have to know what you have you have to be able to have confidence that you can still pull money even on the days you're going to lose ... was going to go dropping what Ryan White\nBut it's not there's nothing you can do about what might or might not have short we can't control you know the economy the markets\nBut you can certainly control what you have and be prepared and you know we have this tried and true saying of our two rules were number one just don't lose the money and rule number two don't forget rule number one and it sounds corny but if if you think about that and you follow those two rules as you\nAre in retirement\nMan that would be a lot easier to sort of whether those bad times\nYeah hey listen in may sound corny Sam and I don't believe that it does but if you go back last week and the Dow drops eight hundred points suddenly\nThose two rules are sounded pretty good at and and that's really what the three sixty five retirement plan is designed to do and that's how you guys are helping and not only your clients but folks that are coming to see you for the first time whether it'd be from the radio show here from your website or from the workshops that you guys are having\nThat is how we help people without tried and true\nProven it works it's a process called the three sixty five retirement plan and it's not one of those you know I think sometimes we meet people and they have this notion that they can come in and we're going to talk about high level stuff a lot of numbers are going to tell me exactly what to do\nI got to tell you the first meeting is really us listening I was listening to what somebody is you know worried about what somebody's goals are harming to they want to travel a lot to do they want to just you know and I'll hang out and play with the grandchildren\nDo you think people are a little taken aback by that that that they're expecting that high level conversation when you guys are just asking them questions and really getting to know them I mean that's got to be a little bit of what they didn't expect\nIt very well might be might but it's ... it's necessary for us to put together a tailor customize three sixty five retirement plan that will allow our clients to sleep at night in a day that's all the\nMen right I think a lot of people are surprised because when sometimes you asked people and the first few minutes hey so nice to meet your wife here\nWhat are they always say to us you know my guy or my girl and they don't listen to me I told them I wanted to slow down and not take as much risk in last week I lost five percent they don't listen to me so part of what we do and the very first stage not first process of that three sixty five retirement plan\nIs to listen to somebody's goals wants needs and concerns and then we come back with what Ryan said earlier\nI'm we take all the information and of course we

[noise] ah this past couple of days the ups and downs in need a way to get out of that and how the three sixty five retirement\nPlan can help you do all of that\nAnd of course we're here with Sam Wang and Ryan marched in over being on land guys let's talk about the market because that's been that you know eating up the headlines are as of late ah recently the Dow dropped eight hundred points\nIn a legal day but oddly enough guys let's talk about this to thirty one years ago also marked a black Monday which is when the Dow dropped\nFive hundred points so let's talk a little bit about that are there any contrast share any similarities and and what are you guys are saying that your clients about these drops in the market\nWill it's been a really volatile time Mike I'm I think a lot of people are nervous or unsettled that especially the ones that don't have a plant and they don't really know what they have and it's causing I'm concerned when they see these drops of eight hundred points to a significant amount over two percent to their entire time you know ... you know that sort of you people\nCan picture a ride you're driving down the road and it's pitch black and the lights shining on the deer and what they do they do nothing they stand than they do nothing and that sort of cars precaution\nYeah part of it they don't know what to do exactly they don't have someone reaching out to them and say hey we're still on track we're not on track we need to make some tweaks right so they are Darren headlights and more importantly\nYou know if you are Thirty years old you might have the time to ride it out Ryan yup but you know we deal with a lot of folks that I knew and retirement and in fact the other day\nWe had a phone call with somebody I came to see us and they said you know it's critical that I don't lose any money because I'm gonna retire in about a month you know so now we have a conversation with him we're going to see them for a meeting\nBut imagine for a second if you or that person I retired two months ago and you're saying you know I just need to take five thousand dollars a month out every month because that's what I Need to pay my bills my housing goes my cell phone my gas bill\nAnd everything's going fine and then all of a sudden blame last week you'd be a little worried about taking more money on cars down right\nYeah yeah ... marketing amnesia they forgot what happened in two thousand eight and they didn't plan accordingly to prevent another two\nThousand and they actually you know Mike we came across this really good study by Stanford University their retirement study and they came across really what really intrigued me as how\nTo set it up so people can understand in part of what we do here on Sunday is not only are we here to have some fun\nBut we're here to help people you know we had to educate people on the things that need they need to be aware of as they get close to retirement things are available in the market that
