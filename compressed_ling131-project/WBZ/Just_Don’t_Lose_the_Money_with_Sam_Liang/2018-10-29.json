risk tolerance to gauge how much do they really want to take and you know you hear on the individual say\nWould you get uncomfortable with a ten percent loss and we asked our clients that all the time

Mike as you said earlier you know you thought you had a plan on all four oh one K. your current four one K.\nDoesn't add up to a plan and that's where we I think where the differences learning more about a three sixty five retirement plan we said three sixty five because you know retirement and it takes a day off since there's three hundred and sixty five year\nSo we named the trademark three sixty five plan and it really works because not only does it sort of take a step back the first step was we talked about earlier drop the show is to discover what somebody's goals are you know my worries are different than your average do I want to travel a whole lot\nOr maybe it's just about leaving a lot of money to your family maybe it's about not even about money maybe it's about lifestyle and taking care of the grandchildren from that point on John you do a great job with the analysis stage where you really just shine a spotlight on what they're doing\nDuring these on certain Financial Times we want to help people navigate through this time and by having a sound investment process in a plan it doesn't take all the ... but it makes people understand that I have an understanding\nOf what I have how it works and how I'm going to get from point a to point B ...\nAnd we also communicate with the clients have listen to the markets acting very volatile right now we explain to them we give them calls we email and then we explain to them what is happening what's causing it oftentimes people don't know\nWhy they're accounts drop and they do to the news on TV and that makes them uncertain by having that sound investment process and having a plan\nIt should be able to weather all aspects of the market\nAnd I think one of the big difference between what a lot of people do and what happens when they get our three sixty five retirement plan is because after\nThe third step which is recommendations often we say to them hey look you know you've been to an okay job growing the money but you can't just rely on the money continues to grow and earn more and more data distribution plant them and then complain\nBecause you know back in the day you don't have to worry about their pension you need a five thousand dollars a month in between Social Security and your pension it's forty five hundred dollars a month so you didn't have a big difference to make up today it's obviously very different right so\nBy having a solid not only accumulation playing John which is what you can ride to a great job that you also need to have an income distribution plant an exit strategy to make sure that you have reliable income each and every month to pay the bills\nAnd when we do have days like we had a few weeks back the reason why the phone's been ringing the reason why when you have a conversation with a client is hey look you know this is why the market went down but it's okay 'cause we're not relying on the part that is going up and down and put food on the\nTape you know we're not using a growth component for income so we we use income components to generate a stream of income that the individual needs um I think the income component is often the most overlooked component any financial planning without um they don't take into consideration the taxation inflation\nThey just have a pile of money and they just don't understand how the and extract money from this and extraction paying the these these individuals they're trying to extract money from\nA plan with the markets dropping so that's when you can now now it's compound the problem for poor individual who doesn't really have a plan he's making withdrawals as the markets decline in front of a declining\nAsset and might you know what we often see is that a lot of times people at this stage their lives\nEspecially when they're very near retirement when we retire they're making a lot of decisions good or bad based on emotions yeah killer as you say hello to kill her you know emotions oh my goodness I got to get the heck out because I'm going to lose everything tomorrow or I'm I'm gonna hang in there will be fine comeback\nBut that's why diversified true diversification and retirement is important having money that's set aside to grow having money that's set aside to give you that income stream and you know you you really need both\nWe use smart portfolios and smartphone those to help us automate those good decisions and also to help us prevent making those emotional decisions in those tough markets\nIt's just don't lose the money radio and just don't lose the money dot com sand and John I'm so glad that you guys are talking about this emotion and how it can basically paralyze us from making good decisions you know we see the market climbing and climbing and climbing as it has been\nA but we tend to forget what happened just a short ten years ago as Suzie Orman puts it you know if we try to do the right thing and take a motion out of things were going to be okay\nI
