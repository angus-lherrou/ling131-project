John Connelly Ryan nice\nTo salvage Twenty years or ... and just lose the money ... here in Boston with unhealthy you fear for your time is low CAT income unique pieces of lifestyles you want all of this\nDon't lose the money will\nRule number one is\nStill in the money that you're staying with us here on just lose the money radio and just lose the money\nDot com today talking about truth and transparency we all like the sound of that also the perfect storm of opportunity and we're going to continue to talk about the workshops that are coming up here at the end of the month of five steps to a successful retirement workshop\nGuys thanks again for for staying here with us second half of just don't lose the money very excited about talking about the\nPerfect storm of opportunity because folks I guess you don't realize what a good position we're in right now if you are planning for retirement a it's a Hillary I'm wearing right\nYeah you know you could be at the wrong place at the wrong time or in this case the right place at the right time and I do I mean by that the perfect storm of opportunity to what does that all all come down to you know John you and I were talking off line how great the market has been\nAnd how nice it is to you know have a discussion on a conversation with our clients about how much money they keep ... been making the last several years\nYeah the last ten years we've been nothing but a bull market harvest in those games are seizing the scope of the uh the the run of the market has been very impressive\nIn now is the time to capitalize especially if you're near in retirement or in retirement you got to harvest those gains put those gains in your pocket in the same time we really have an opportunity now to pay\nLower taxes problem the lowest tax bracket in the last century and that's not going to be the case forever because that it's going to expire in two thousand twenty five so you have those two forces coming at you and if you're five to ten years away from retirement I mean you know we talked to so many people are people in their\n... let's say fifty five to six to get you thinking about retirement now it's it's more insight you know one day I'll retire well that one day is nearing ... is getting closer and closer and then at sixty two\nYou know a lot of times we have discussion about people with people you should I take Social Security saying what do you think you know I read that they're not going to be here forever or should I not take Social Security I Know if I'm going to leave it alone is going to grow some more and then at sixty two to sixty five you really sweet spot and you're thinking about Ken I retire and this is the time\nTo harvest those games and that's what we're talking about the perfect storm of opportunity\nAnd you know you talk about that perfect storm of opportunity and and same you mentioned taxes and people's eyes just light up and they lead a little bit further and they're like well how do you want it more of a ... yeah yeah so so tell us a little bit more of that because\nIt really when you think about it uh it's kind of like a clock ticking down and you have a limited amount of time to really take advantage of this and it's really a special opportunity for people to do that\nWithout a doubt in your people are saying well you know that sounds great but you know I don't make five hundred thousand dollars a year so the fact that hires marginal tax bracket went from thirty nine point six thirty seven doesn't really affect me well if you're making a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year I'll use that example\nLast year you were in the twenty eight percent tax bracket this year you'll be in the twenty two percent tax bracket which means if you made a hundred and sixty grand you\nJust put an extra Ninety six hundred dollars in your pocket almost ten grand ... you know what if you don't capture that opportunity you're not going to get that extra ten thousand dollars you're not going to\nKnow that you have that opportunity now 'cause I had an opportunity also expires in two thousand twenty five so that's when we keep talking about the perfect storm of opportunity\nWell that perfect storm of opportunity is right now and uh I just saw you come in a little while ago with these ah books these stretch for retirement books she got attacked him these\nAre for listeners today the author of that book Patrick Kelly he talks about some of the strategies that can get you that potentially lower tax environment in retirement let's listen to Patrick and when he has to say about that\nI think the Roth IRA is a fantastic\nTool it allows you to pay taxes today not worry about having to pay taxes later on your growth\nSo paying taxes today versus postponing a our taxes John uh and paying those later on as you explained it in the past paying taxes on the harvest versus paying taxes little tiny taxes on the seats right now [noise]\nYeah I mean like we sit there with the client recently they um we're contribute to their four one K. and they weren't taken advantage of the the Ross option inside the four oh one K. and we try to explain to them it was titled taxes today and\nWhat happens is you have a four O. one K. not all the shores so ready to local ... at a silent partner\nThat the person who has a handout waiting for you to start extracted money or taking money from your four one K. whereas if you were taken advantage of the rough portion inside your four O. one K. you're going to use after tax dollars but that money is not going to grow tax free versus tax deferred\nTax deferred means is kinda like you're getting on the mass\nPike you don't pay a a a toll getting all you're going to pay the toll get off\nThe magic paying the toll in in sturbridge rather than in past times the amount that\nExactly too so we had a conversation with them we help them start contributing to the Roth portion of their four one K. because that's one of the money that's going to be coming out tax free so\nWhen we sit with people we we go through the process and not playing with them you know taxes play a big role in this ah oftentimes people have under estimated what they're going to have to pay in taxes on the eye or raise a requirement um distribution so you can't go to you can't go to the supermarket\nJohn and buy groceries with gross money can you know got to be a net and values had mothers taxes mean a whole lot and as you were talking about that part of the whole process is really to have a conversation you know and we had a conversation with these people they heard about raw for one case but they never had somebody\nSay to him did you check with your age are department to see if you had that option oh I didn't think about that\nAnd sure enough they had that option and they took advantage of that option and gave them a little bit better balanced when the money was to come out some would come out tax free\nYeah they don't people think they're tool like I thought it was too late you know I'm coming down the home stretch but you know you have those um [noise] I ... a ... a catch all provisions and so forth so you know there's there's a lot\nOf always opportunities and what I what I'm basically getting too is have a conversation if you haven't started a conversation with you know maybe your advisor maybe it'll happen advisor\n... we give this opportunity to people have a conversation with us learn more about our process learned more about the three sixty five retirement plan\nIn fact we'll give you an hour about time John and I will sit down with you you all have our undivided attention or listen to your wish list what your goals are what your concerns are and then ultimately put together what we call the three sixty five retirement plan", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Just Don\u2019t Lose the Money with Sam Liang", "city": "Boston", "day": "15"}
