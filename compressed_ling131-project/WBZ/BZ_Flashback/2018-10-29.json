harvested all these games and now here we are witnessing involved all in uncertain times in all of a sudden their their portfolio might be dropping quicker than what their risk tolerance is really\nSet at so they became aggressive rather than moderate or conservative\nSo they need to re balanced portfolio so it's great when the market goes up when you become unbalanced and the market goes up great but when the market starts to correct itself and start the show signs of uncertainty then you start seeing that account dropping much quicker than you probably are willing to take

month you know what I'm getting is just not enough and taken in about twenty eight hundred dollars a month\nI kinda find myself worry and at the end of the month every month so I think I Need like thirty five hundred can my money can buy retirement plan would stand that we had a conversation we made some changes and\nYou know and they say you know she signed a form and she's getting thirty five

client\nMy communication is the key I'm a very proactive person I Am not a reactive person I Want to make sure our clients are formed of what's going on what's happening with their accounts so we're very proactive but\nWe do sit down with my clients no less than once a year for an annual review take a look at the ... are we still don't attract so these portfolios and these this plan that we put together isn't something that we we put together than we\nThrow it on the shelf and forget about it we men and Julie massage that plan on a yearly basis things happen changes happen\nThat's absolutely right John I think you are absolutely correct to say that being proactive is better than being reactive of course but also is the relationship that you have right now and maybe you don't even have a relationship or those people capable sort of helping you not only today\nBut for many years to come you know when I built this company my partner and regional partners Richard you know we built this

they feel powerful and then they go out and they get a gun and they do with this piece of garbage did yesterday and the other thing I Want to say about this is I really wish that everybody on television and radio would stop using the word deranged\nA it is I think it is unhelpful and and somewhat reckless because this guy was not deranged the bomber the would be bomber that it was something else we need to talk about that\nWas sending the packages to the Democratic politicians also not deranged and the man who shot the two black people in the kroger's in Kentucky also awful also horrific but you know they're not deranged what they have in common is it that they are criminals and you've heard me talk about this\nAnd we're going to keep talking about it because it is an important distinction because as long as we keep saying where it's like lunatic into range and mental health first of all\nIt's offensive to people who have mental health diagnoses because the vast majority of them are not homicidal\nMost than ten ... not most again I Can't I don't I won't make a generalization but if there's harm done more often than not people with mental health diagnoses are self injurious and unless you're talking about the extremely rare rare rare situation when you have maybe perhaps the skin\nGets a friend who has a break with reality and they think they're fighting you know or or whatever is in their mind they're manifestation\nThat's extremely rare and that's not the profile of all these people that we're talking about six and seven to five or ten thirty I Want to hear from you is that they are criminals and the definition of a criminal if somebody who was once who will\nWho wants to end will eventually do whatever they want whenever they want however they want it they have no discipline they have no compunction they have no morals they are amoral\nPieces of human refuse that's what they are criminals and unless and until we have a real conversation about this and we decide as a nation to nip it in the bud by which I mean put repeat offenders in jail for life\nLike this guy in Florida like the would be bomber now with the criminal murderer\nFrom from Pittsburgh I I ... the news is developing I haven't seen yet that he has a record and so we can actually cure a lot of this problem by going after the repeat criminals and putting them in jail before they become\n... murderers for people who don't have a criminal record and their first act is a mass murder that's a difficult problem and we shouldn't lie to the American public and say we have some kind of panacea because we don't I've wrote about this after the Parkland shooting\nYou can look my op ed in the ... in the little son I'll give you the title after the break but the the only thing you can do at this point is to guard against these kind of mass murderers is to have a premium defense and it's it's it's terrible\nThat schools and churches and synagogues are going to have to have\nSerious um security locks metal detectors whatever the the experts advise maybe you know whatever road that leads to we're going to have to do it now of course as soon as I say that\nI have to tell the whole truth which is what I Do hear a weekend live is that if you read that story on the shooter in Kentucky he tried to go into a what was the black church and the door he was banging on the door and the doors were locked\nSo obviously that save those lives but then he went to the Kroger and he murdered two people there so it's it's really horrible when a woman in the parking lot and then I think somebody else\nI'm I'll check those that somebody else in the store but really horrible horrible so it's we\nHave to balance freedom with security and there's all of these these\n... ferry as criminals roaming about so\nI think we should guard against anybody who says we have a one hundred percent solution because that's a lie\nBut I think at least we can guard the places that we can guard like\nChurches schools libraries even grocery stores you know what I'll pay I Will pay\nWhatever it takes twenty five cents more fifty cents more whatever it takes you know and I'll I'll reduce my food budget if if we need to have armed guards at grocery stores to save lives then then I'm all in for that too\nI'm six when seven to five or ten thirty if you all got other

b._b._c. news radio from our eye heart studio okay we're talking about the massacre yesterday at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh when here thought six when seven to science for ten thirty going to go back to Tom in Ohio\nAbout his race it make it for me over it you know it's a continuous the venue for just a second and and then to a a ... a grown another area\nWho thinks about that up an number one I think that uh in that situation he may have had somebody later on in life that affected him I can I can recall of the Harvard study a that a ... a sociology group\nThat went into a poverty area and they concluded that you know very early age at these kids had no chance in other words you're gonna miss was decades ago they were going to end up in a a ... you know behind bars and so forth well turned out that the majority of them\nWere ended up being professional and and when they went to interview these people they can remember one teacher and that teacher made them feel important right\nShe cared about ... and you know it's a matter of building up their steam it was a matter of coping skills\nUm it's a matter of great extent I think keep teaching people better social choked socializing skills\nAnd you know even the coping skills if we could better enforce those maybe we'd get a lot of people from turning to drugs that we see is an epidemic right now I\nKnow that the other part of this is I think uh immigration and I really think it I mean you just say well at the immigration tighten all this from the white from the standpoint that many of these\nUh white shooters white the massacres and so forth\nI I really think that it's a great extent not only do they fit the category of needing nearly nurturing but also they have been branded by the government as well as society in many instances\nFor the past fifty years as being inferior because of the minority preferences and so forth that for the past fifty years\nHave gone to a other groups\nAnd here's here's the kicker and it is that if if if that process was their fifty years ago as ... as you alluded to at taught ... countries but I haven't seen as for\nFor a decade now that if that were there in such a way as it should have been which was to write the injustices for\nA slavery and discrimination and segregation and the show that the the strict break the stereotypes that you know women and minorities can do jobs\nThat were typical typically held by white milk which you know the first one was done I'm Sorry the second one was done\nAs far as breaking the stereotypes stereotypes but what hasn't been done in many instances is getting the people who are for generations black Asian\nOr a Hispanic from the inner cities and and turning the gang gang violence into better jobs and lifting them up\nWell because all the money thing and we will because that's a lot because a lot of money the sec definitely immigration\nNot only that but a lot of the people coming in off the boat off the plane across the border who were not discriminate against facing discriminate segregation or anything else up are better selections ... then the people that it was intended for get passed over\nAnd the white males are still stepped aside so you have to endure groups you have the angry inner city group that are passed over and I think you know the white people were doing that to them and you have the white males who are looking at\nHey I'm no one's been victimized here on the one that's got the government on my back when they hear that from one of the supremacy groups some supremacy group has a scapegoat initiative since it's the Jews\nWell it was a Jewish people but I Want to push I mean I I I hear what you're saying but I Want to make sure that it's crystal clear that um I think they don't um if they feel that way toughened up for them the white men because it's like I I mean you can it's it's not an excuse number well no it's not yours\nAnd I know you're not saying I Know what I'm saying you're making somebody\nWho's vulnerable to duct that thought who who who does the the reality that for for the part of fifty years they've been to a step to step aside by the government for some other group and that's where you get the word she promised she\nSees really heated discussion I think so because it's like there's so many different levels so first of all it's it's not\nLike these these miscreants white guys and by the wayside in Florida I I I don't know that he's Filipino I think he was born here\nUm so that you know find he's a U.S citizen scum bags but um I I don't know that he's as Sara Lee white and I always hate having this discussion about whether you know what color the person is because of all the same they're all murderers to me and\nI agree and so what I'm saying but what everyone\nHere let me let me let me finish up the thought though after um because I always appreciate your input is that\nUm if we're always trying to dissect this problem based on race and so like these white men are susceptible to this hate because um of of the proper things we tried to do to make up for um the sins of our past\nWere never it's never it's never going to the ship is never going to write itself because I don't that's not the fundamental problem is the white men and the wife whoever it is the criminals whether the urban or suburban or whoever they are they're they're just going to like all criminals use those excuses to justify their actions\nAnd unless and until like I Want I Want everybody to sort of jumped on the field with me of condemning criminals across the spectrum left right center black white Indian age would ever do you know what I'm saying we start breaking it down in a form of behavior and I like you know people\nWho are calm and cool and collected and we are going to call out all the extremist and we are going to stop ... their behavior from the get go and I think that's the winning the winning solution is because I

I haven't read her she was quite remarkable but if people actually could get ours with themselves and spend a little time thinking about\nWhat they do and why they do it right they might be better people I maybe not but possibly could be\nI completely agree pat and and the the only the one directive I mean look it's it's great and you know when people help other people I think it's wonderful I mean I have a long career of doing exactly that but\nIf people can't help other people than there was one main directive that everybody needs to follow and that's you know harm do no harm okay if you take care of yourself properly and do no harm to others it's a pretty straight forward roll\nWell I think it ... version of that it's a show called golden rule I don't want to ... ... ... ... ...\nExactly also one of my they maxim for a living [laughter] fat\nAnd okay this is my first phone call to you but I'll just finish up with what the the\nFact that very few people acknowledge especially nowadays that what every single one person does affects everybody and there are many people don't want to accept responsibility for their actions\nExactly pat responsibility thing I Am running I Am really close to the break but I'm Wondering like yeah yeah 'cause it was important calling and your first time call call us again OK\nOkay I'll Try to get in a market Dexter\nYou're good thank you have a good night for about ... by okay\nAre you are listening to weekend live we're gonna come back after the break I Am your host Marie said Franco back at ten o'clock well welcome\nTo Jimmy done by your new nine green we saw was so good how do you make it\nHigher quality ingredients in line I mean we definitely don't sing along with my when it's baking slum either went parenting two babies right and we don't do the baby here you are to carry the warm ... subs to the cooling rack I mean they're not babies sandwiches\nOkay I'll take a turkey Tom oh don't name on it makes it harder dry our new nine Greene reached up to me ... ... yeah\n[noise]\nW. W. H. two years of image do you do and I had written\nBack to that lie fleet I I have said there's so many times on the air and yeah I Will keep repeating it although repeating thinks is not my favorite cup of tea [laughter] I'm the kind of person who I liked who are very good ideas I like to say them once and thirty much I'm under the next solution so but\nUnfortunately in politics and discussion things have to be said ad nauseam before they start ringing in to people's heads so I'll give it to you again\nThis is not asylum these are not asylum seekers flame bad economic conditions or street crime even horrific street crime gang violence does not qualify someone as a refugee\nThe media miss uses the word over and over again and they know what it means they know that the proper term for people fleeing these kinds of\nConditions is displaced person even people flee war or not refugees they are displaced persons unless you are specifically targeted for persecution by your government on the basis of five categories which are a political opinion ethnicity\nReligion race or social group\nWhich is a whole other discussion unto itself but unless you can connect whether you can show in next is between what between membership in one of those groups and the persecution\nAnd you are fear even fear for your life or grave bodily danger\nThat is not asylum if you can't prove one of those things\nAnd then there's a whole bunch of criteria that even if you hit that if you get if you make that that threshold you still may not improperly may not probably will not qualified okay to repeat flame bad economic conditions are street crime does not qualify someone as a refugee [noise]\nThe media knows the proper term is displaced person but the that doesn't that doesn't qualify for their emotional blackmail agenda so they use the term refugee and we can do\nDo you use we're only we can only make deductions based on the\nEvidence at hand so we can deduce from their repeated misuse of the word that they do it for the singular purpose of perpetrating like I said emotional blackmail on the American people want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to

Franco you're listening to\nWe can live with me or is it a Franco on\nThe b._b._c.\nNews radio ten thirty six one seven to five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty we are continuing our discussion of caravan caravan to point out from this year at least twenty team but as I wrote in my op ed today in the little son\nWell I wrote in my op ed which was published today in the last ... to be precise\nCaravan of thirty to a point though because this has gone been going on\nSince Reagan's amnesty an amnesty begets amnesty begets amnesty because amnesty\nAnd lawlessness begets lawlessness because lawlessness gets free benefits for illegal aliens and so on down the line and now back\nTo this vicious lie as perpetrated by many in the media that I was talking about before the break\nIs that these are refugees they're not as I said before true asylum seekers go to one of the forty legal ports of entry that are are long our southern border and I asked why do you think\nThat they do not get your your allegedly trekking and you're getting train rides or bus riser track rides for some of that but let's just assume you're walking the whole way the Fifteen hundred plus trek to the U.S border ... thank\nYou might be able to hit one of those forty eight legal ports of entry given that there every forty one point for three miles yeah ask yourself why they don't I'll tell you why\nBecause criminals don't go to them because they know they have no legal way to enter the U.S nor do they care\nTheir invaders plain and simple\nInvaders our enemies not our friends not refugees not the hapless poor\nDid you see some of the footage of the like some of those people look very well fed to well fed yeah I said that did you see the brand new baby carriage one of them had a lot of them you know they were not your emaciated walking pour that you would generally see\nUm people coming allegedly for the American\nDream and by the way to to see some of the guys with the tattoos yeah those hats [laughter]\nThere you know they're not just for fun please really I mean everybody just shoving this down our throats is just an absolute immoral illegal list and\nLike I said they're not the habits for they invade our borders in between legitimate ports of entry with one sole purpose to pillage America of her jobs for those that actually work\nNot going to say the majority but if they do\nVillages of her jobs are free benefits her everything that the goal\nNefarious people are organizing this assault on America and using kids in many instances as pawns to do it seven thousand plus people do not just come together organically without the machinations of coyotes cartels and there are better as\nPoor families is just one but one vicious lie perpetrated by the craven pools and pundits\nWho live and protected neighborhoods and who will never feel the dire consequences of destroyed borders and the desecration of law and order then evidently results from invasion denial\nThat the diagnosis invasion denial and they're oh\nIt's a rampant across the country going to go to we want to hear from you six one Seventy five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty we have Mike from Canada hello Mike you're on the air\n[noise] show you doing I'm well thanks how are you [noise]\n... ... because it would listen to the radio I listen to your show or like at a hearing camera or we're very close with the Americans we of are quite close cultural and the values and I find it odd that\nCanada in America are going through the same thing at the same time we're borders are being debated mhm\nBy people who do assimilate to our values they don't want to\nAnd they like what the\nPeople come from South America up to the United states [noise] once they get to the United states you think they're going to get jobs they're not they're going to be on welfare they're gonna be hill but they're not going to\nTry and assimilate into what America's values or they come from places that they don't care about things that I've noticed lately that you know the officials in both your country ended up buying ... they don't care about what the calmer person says if you if you raise your voice about it they call you a racist\nTackling exactly\nYou know it's just a truce you're always say I don't want people coming out of it\nThat don't assimilate to our values and they say oh you're a racist for say well no you know I don't know where people come on if they're going to do it they're supposed to do a lot of work and and and contribute to the economy but when they don't uh\nIt's just a burden on everybody else taxpayers just do you have to put the bill for them and you don't stay geo ... two hundred and eighty million people\nIn the states three hundred and twenty twenty five\nHere in Canada we only have thirty ... thirty eight million people and we're just being in in a number of people are coming from everywhere right yeah and you know go ahead Mike but\n\nWill just listen go home and contribute six one seven to five more ten thirty four eighty to ... ten thirty this these we can live on ... news radio pins are welcome back\nEverybody I'm your host Marie said Franco we are talking about invasion thirty two point oh where do I get that number that is derived from Ronald Reagan's Nineteen eighty six amnesty and since then and I that's the only one year so I'm actually probably be pretty conservative and that number 'cause\nIt's probably double depending on how you want to calculate the numbers it's in the millions obviously\nSo want to hear music twin seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty we're going to go to Joe [noise] [noise] hey\nHi okay so a lot in our way to acquire stating the obvious a lot of people call it and and then keep repeating the same you know obvious things with everyone already knows\nEverybody I like to give people you know\nIt's true it's true because I don't want to sound like a big old whatever here isn't so sure okay and this thing that needs to be done at the same time whichever comes first doesn't matter number\nNo benefits to anyone that's not a citizen of this country area very important maybe the solution is federal complains that with\nMore than a baby or\nJoe Joe I just want to jump in for thinking I Love you Eli give your solutions but don't think that I don't I get solutions on the show every week and I don't know you\nDon't want the colds you know people in the same thing over and over\nAnd say okay so you had all I don't know benefits we got it mhm\nYeah that's well no maybe anchors no one talks about people come from all countries they pop baby the baby automatically as American lives ... says whatsoever you cannot do it anywhere else in a war world if I go to friends Mexico Germany I bought a baby the baby ... not because of a citizen of the country\nThan just the craziness joke\nBirthright citizenship and it did it as a valid point and want to clarify off the top of my head I know you're correct Germany does not have birthright citizenship France I had the nose but not with me I'm like what\nIf what we don't want to get ... you know let's talk about a ...\nNo wait what I'm saying Joe it's like no but I Want people to know because every time somebody brings a birthright citizenship I Know a lot of people out there I\nThink like automatically and like oh racist in the constitution number one is not in the constitution and we can have a discussion that the number to like a lot of these left wing or is who always want to say let's do things away Western Europe dies and so my answer back to the ... Germany does not have\nBirthright citizenship nor I lot of the other Western European countries so I'm On board let's do it that way right so that exactly we want to talk about the fact\nThat a referendum on it you know obviously very simple no more no more a baby popping birthright citizenship and obviously secure the border and no path to citizenship to anyone who entered illegally uh let me go back to a country of origin you're\nPaying a correct leads up then you and your wife a green card okay yeah that that will do the basics then there's other little they don't you know voting whip to be careful about voting obviously um and and the little details but the basic oh wait insane just kind of\nBearing it out and we like ignoring it like as if it's not their brain let's send the army to the border are you gonna than imagine there were the country next door that gives you a million dollars just by getting to let's say Canada would give Americans million bucks if\nYou manage to cross the border you don't think Americans will figure out how to cross that border yeah of course who Wharton I probably would have detected a million bucks makes sense so\nNot made it is [laughter] you know what I mean I wouldn't want to\nDeal with all the time they both people were getting the problem was we know the problem the murder the way they ever stop your being called race it we know the problems no one wants to talk about solutions and even trial\nAs good as it doesn't like had addressed the issue of no more baby anchors and a story out and saying what are we doing\nJokes are free money\nI ... well I'm I talks that showed that that's them solution person so\nAmazing look just go to Don and you'll see there'll be nobody wants to come to this country got made it to work like a buddy that keeps saying you know the liberal racist or what was going to New Orleans older liberal thing that goes on to a racist\nAmerica will cleaned up on it all cleaned up boil it that's where I got a job if you pay good we set our exactly at the high you know probably ... thank thank you so much of a good night with bank\nOkay next we can go to rich in Pennsylvania rich you are on the

like their scholarships and internships and and everything I'm but only if you're a foreign language speaker\nNow or is that not\nWe um had loan it's funny or my we couldn't stand [noise] so I suggested that we learn English and we can just hang up for six months you know so it was\nBut I'm the I'm ray last week I remember which night had a near a school nurse all in ... talking about people coming here not being immunized and coming in spreading\nSo my question is to all of the people\nAre with all the degrees who think that this is a great idea\n... how do you feel\nAbout your children get all the rest of us\nThey don't care Patty because their children go to private schools they don't have to mix in with the mass is\nNot not that we're not all of them ... ... oh\nI mean I just people really need to think about that well\nThey do because we're seeing like TB we eradicated it's like there's all these incidences of resistant um measles weren't strains of measles and all different some [noise] God it's just it's it's a nice lady that we have to have this actual discussion\nFor these diseases that we've eradicated and then people all of a sudden like oh my God you're racist because you're saying immigrants bring disease no it's ... that people come from countries that don't have regular vaccination\nThat's tax\nIt you know I had the chicken pox wasn't perfect but that can go on to shingles mhm yes it's very very serious\nAnd we'll all as are a lot of the protests says and all different sorts of diseases that are coming back\nAnd they're not just come into the only reason they're coming back is because of immigration that is a point of fact\nAnd like you said how do people feel about their kids if there is I bet they I don't know maybe the ... like the the the purists then I don't use that word in a a complementary fashion the purists among them was like oh well I Would just let my child deal with it because this is a greater sacrifice for you know the downtrodden\nBut most people are already that the right ... you know your exactly right but you know what your private school if any difference I going to keep it in an\nExactly exactly and now I\nI really am horrified and I think people need to stand up listen and pay attention\nThat's where we're apps I agree Patty and it's not like this is\nI mean I don't I Want to be optimistic because if you know people won't be\nI'm motivated to act as they think that there's no solution so it's a sometimes but I also want to be honest it's like I I fear sometimes if I'm you know this is a losing battle but even if it is I still I mean I Know when I'm ready to fight\nOff I have voted ... you know I have cats my ballot [noise] and the voting those good\nExcellent as um I hear today that Elizabeth Warren showed up in Lawrence and I started a little too late [laughter] not a lot of fields and there are ... okay\nOkay yeah Patty I'm a little too little a little too late on a lot of friends I'm\nSo sorry I'm back to your question on the English I whenever I Want to circle back to your question an English language um it's like again there's a lot of ... it was funny Patty is that Democrats um\nA lot of Democrats were saying exactly the same thing the things that Trump Hussein now like I'm sure you've seen the footage of Dianne Feinstein talking about we're not going to be the this is Dianne Feinstein said we're not going to be the welfare nation from Mexico\nOK I'm paraphrasing here that's what she sat right and then and a Chuck Schumer is sitting there talking about illegal aliens and they can't come illegally and then there's footage of a rock Obama President Obama saying you can't come here legally\nAnd the same with Hillary Clinton and not that long ago\nRight and it's but it's it lays bear how craven they are because at one time they actually believed in securing America and secure borders but now that they hate Trump so much whatever he says they're going to say the opposite to the ... the whole country\nOut of the of the United states of America that\nMary ... unbelievable it's sick I mean I never thought in my lifetime I Would say anything like this the anger at age ... speaking papal neighbors you know it's just a shame you didn't think it\nIs shameful but that's why I Want people that's why that's why I write my op ed that's why I talk about this in a very methodical thorough fact filled\nBasis because I'm trying to get through to people that you don't have to scream and yell at each other you can I mean you you there is a there is a right way and a wrong way to do things and were you\nWhen you leave you with this vote and like the ... the Facebook group of friends of WB thing I'd say with good where I Am one who is progressive who wants to be outside his father is every court he and I going to sit down\nAnd have coffee oh that's very nice and I'm going to bring a friend and ask him to bring a friend and I I was selling crash that\nI didn't know how many people for the new report and that he ...

I I I'd rather just reduce the level of legal immigration across the board or apps and I'm a retailer out ourselves or you know Joe I'm Sorry I had and go into a heartbreak here but I Want to change\nThe war is I just wanted to say how it's been a while and I think you call again okay All right we again are going to go now we have a live\nRed Sox report with Sherry small is coming to you right at this break with they live report over to Sherry\nThanks Murray or W.
