S. F. M. H. G. two men for an eye heart radio station [noise]\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio ten thirty or the news was never saw [noise]\nIn the realm a lot of things that she brought up so I think she\nDid a service to the country and to all of us Americans when she laid out point by point a lot of very specific pieces of information that fills in the gaps of all the rhetoric that's been going on so I'm going to start with [noise]\nYou know the the obvious is that\nIn Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd I'm quoting from her President Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three nominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway and she was confirmed Ninety six to three\nThe next year just three months after independent counsel Robert Fisk was named to lead the whitewater investigation President Clinton nominated justice briar he was concerned confirmed eighty seven to nine\nNow why is that important\nI think it's phenomenally important because I think it shows that\nYou know this ... this all of this hubbub about President Trump can't have a justice get nominated justice because of this Mueller investigation number one is hogwash\nBut number two it also shows that you know Republicans they don't when President Clinton obviously one those elections that election and\nHe got his justices overwhelming majority so you know was it Ninety six Democrats voting there were half the amount of Republicans and same with the eighty seven to nine\nFor briar so it seems an and they were liberal justices I'm sure many of those Republicans voted for them had diametrically opposed beliefs and absolutely did not want to see\nThe philosophy of the court shift but you know they were grown ups they took their um consequences of not winning an election and and they overwhelmingly approved the justices and good for them so I think that's that's important to keep in mind\nThen the next the next issue second\nThat a lot of people wanted to try to make this argument well it's not about the sexual so it's not about his temperament it's really about his his allegiance is a legit allegiance to presidential power and that\nKavanaugh some kind of I'm Phil and forgiving presidents on\nUnlimited power again enter Susan call Senator Susan Collins a very she just laid it right out there and you know she had said that Kavanaugh when she asked him\nAbout opinions that he thought were important and he stated three ... three out of the four cases he stayed a worm ... versus Madison Youngstown Youngstown steel versus Sawyer and United States versus Nixon [noise]\nThree of the four greatest Supreme Court cases in history I'm quoting her speech and she asks what do they have in common each of them is a case where the courts served as a check on presidential power\nAnd I would know this is still Collins and I would note that the fourth case the judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as the greatest in history was brown versus board of education [noise]\nSo again they are very methodical fact based substance and if you have a justice that things Marbury Youngstown steel and Nixon are three important cases it does those are those are the bread crumbs to follow as to what their judicial philosophy is\nAnd I think that's important I Want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty\nSo those were two very important points I thought that I Know they didn't they probably haven't the news has been given them most in the media hasn't given that a lot of coverage because\nThey're not sexy they're not salacious there there with them the other people in the media would term boring I don't because I think you know what everyone else thinks is boring I Know it was important and very serious because this is how\nDoes how things actually move forward and get done by looking at the substance by looking at\nWhat we lawyers I Know very um dinosaur wet dinosaur like in our dinosaur like ways of of looking at evidence and believing evidence is important well here's some evidence to show what\nThis justice now justice Kavanaugh's split judicial philosophy is about and\nI'm going to go on with some other points throughout the hour and I want to talk about that with you I Want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty do you think those are two important points that senator Collins\nMade and are you happy with her vote I Am I think if he\nHad he not been confirmed I think it would have set a as long as we're talking about president I think it would have terrible one to basically say that you can play dirty tricks and dirty politics with anybody up for an appointment and this is the question I Want I Want to ask you tonight and I want you to think about\nIt because a lot of people are a lot of people all over the Twitter universe the Twitter verse whatever\nAre\nTrying to paint him as a little you know this elitist rich boy and there's no question he had he had a a good background\nI'm I'm sure he also worked hard as well and the fact is is like we can't just hate people because they came from um you know a certain background I mean hating someone because they're rich as the same same same problems heating someone because they're poor\nIt's it's it's it's stupid it's maniacal if Davis of and it's it's\nNot it's grouping someone into a group and then pull you know the sins of that group on to that individual and his anti American the foundation of America is that we take everyone as an individual\nThat's the point but what did the point I Want to make about\nEverybody ... trying to tar Kavanaugh's and elitist and someone in power and he used a system to his advantage is just think about this if he is as powerful and well off and wealthy as everyone\nSays he is\nAnd if they could do this to him if they could\nSmear him and nearly topple this nomination what do you think they're going to do to you out there who doesn't have power prestige connections\nOr any kind of defense when they came after you\nAnd and my answer is you won't be able to do anything because they will have you hook line and sinker and you're all done if you want to try to get into the realm of the powerful if you want to try to get into the top of your field\nThey will come after you with both barrels and that is why this whole process has been atrocious and a total disgrace I Want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty maybe back after the break\n\nWe go on the news where the ...

thoughts on Susan Collins speech her a yes vote and any other item you want to bring to the discussion going to go right to you we have gene from Salem hello Jane\nYou're on the air I attorney Mary for the Franco hygiene\nI Want to thank you for wrapping this topic I\nThink you You're welcome [laughter]\nI Want to I Want to thank Senator Susan Collins for having the courage to be thoughtful and to explain things to people\nAnd I heard the media like dissing her and I'm thinking wait a minute she's making total sense and I love to hear Chely top but we have a system Charlie men um as you pointed out to him so I just I'm a ... court rundown we've got\nJohn Roberts Clarence Thomas Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch all appointed by Republican presidents and Ruth Bader Ginsburg Stephen Breyer Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan all appointed by democratic presidents so\nYou know that fifty fifty and now we have Brett Kavanaugh by Trump and you know Neil Gorsuch was a Trump so it's it's we don't know which direction he's going to go in\nAnd that's the thing Jane everybody like with their hair on fire always jumping to conclusions and we all we know that a significant portion of this debate is really about abortion um but as people that are wrong in the past the\n... the only abortion thing because what you can see it suggests say the mob mentality I think Senator Susan Collins if I recall correctly in the news got three thousand hangers mail to her\nYeah yes I mean\nThe ... like I don't want to live in a country where it's mob mentality where people are thinking and with that their response\nUm I Do think out of the problem and it's not ages them but when people get power they never leave and they don't let the next generation come in they don't mentor people rate from that hearing Dianne Feinstein I think that they'd be five I might be wrong and I can't remember the gentleman who was the gentleman that was a champion from the Republican side I\nThink he's already five also wrestling um yeah I think that both in their eighties and we know we know nothing against people in their eighties I Love\nMy legal in the eighties Ruth Bader Ginsburg I think\nIs eighty five but the thing is I think about if people when does the next generation get a turn\nWhen they don't and what happens ... and that's like I Want to make this point because the joy joy may her from the view was kind of constantly old white men old white men and I pushed back against that because it's not the fact that people are all because if people knew seven if someone's in their seventies and they want to run for office the first time I'm I'm all for that right\nAbsolutely and I'm for gender neutral so I agree with you on that we're trying to be gender neutral\nLongevity but when people like this stay there he they skipped an entire used it skipped an entire generation because\nGeorge George Washington right our very first president made sure he didn't stay there and he did it for a reason\nRight but now people in the women in their fifties and sixties they're never going to get a shot because now and\nThey never got a shot and because they couldn't do it because the men would keep the men were were Bogart and all the seats okay we're in it because they're all up there in their eighties\nRight and now and now those women will will will be are going to be passed over because now they're too old great because not twenty seven years old and a socialist\nBut so and and that's the way\nWe only have two parties and I'm not a Republican and Bernie Sanders was not even an option he was a socialist and you know Hillary Clinton came with her baggage but looking at the cabinet guy what people were not looking at is his mom was a lawyer at the time\nThat women weren't lawyers his wife was there he's got two daughters himself said he sat more female if everybody's into this female thing clerks up to cook for the U.S Supreme Court maybe he's not as I I have no idea whether he bought it as a teenager if he brought to the other teenager I haven't\nNo idea I wasn't there mhm you know that was thirty seven years ago I'm pretty sure we all except for you I Know you're quite marvelous didn't have issues as a teenager a lot of us in America did because\nI mean there were things that happened to me that weren't pleasant you know that\nIt will it happen to us from all the women I've spoken to wear like who hasn't been bothered and yes we did all try to speak out but nobody listened\nAnd said I'm OK you know I have a confession to make okay please don't you don't have a vested already eight states I'm going to convince the thirty states I to drink beer in high school I tell my goodness and wine cooler too I mean that's the share various isn't like a\nBig thing that's so strange because there's all these every corner I go to visit new craft beer thing I don't see what the big issue is with beer but\nWell it was underage drinking and you know it's not right anybody out there who lives in the underage drinking is not right you shouldn't do it um you know but I just I'm honest about it and don't pretend like I didn't\nDo well and I if I recall correctly and I am older than you it was it was just turned from Eighteen to Twenty one back that was Eighteen you know\nEarly certain states yes yeah the only way they don't want to get on the conversation I hire use my attorney like thank you Jane [laughter] no no that's\nAll right and you know I I think what Susan Collins is explain to people you know we have a ... we we go by the rule of law mhm right and we have to process and even though this was a job interview you can't like take and destroy another human being based on not too much of anything\nWhen and I didn't happen I have no idea mhm but you know thirty seven years later and people hold on to the information it was just very very very political\nHe's on the left and the people in the left are always saying oh you know white privilege men um you know in Mazie Hirono his words shut up oh men should shut up right okay so\nSo Mazie Hirono is allowed to tell men to shut up but then men on the left like south McFarland is allowed to tell Susan Collins a woman what to do I mean does anyone ever look up\nThe definition of hypocrisy and the dictionary and by the way says McFarland is the creator of the character in his in his show\nUm quagmire who is basically a rapist and a sexual predator and he makes jokes about rape on his show and I found some parts of Family Guy funny but I really couldn't watch it\nA consistently because it was I just you know call me ... me or whatever you want um I have a wicked sense of humor of a\nWell developed sense of humor I don't think rape is funny I don't think a rape was unconscious of of unconscious women it's funny I don't think any kind of rape is funny and I don't think that character was funny so you know really McFarland take a good look in the mirror and I'm\nNever I it just this is the kind of BS that I just I Can't abide but one thing I Do want to say again as a thank you to senator Collins is that\nThis was I think I don't know it's hard to pick out the best part but I thought this was really just jumped off a jumped off the Senate floor and she'd see her into anybody who enter into anybody's hit the campus um and remember this\nFor time immemorial him in a quote that judge Kavanaugh is more\nOf a centrist in some of his critics maintain is reflected in the fact that he and chief judge Merrick Garland voted the same way in Ninety three percent of the cases that they heard together\nIndeed chief judge Garland joined in more than Ninety six percent of the majority opinion authored by judge Kavanaugh's dissent dean only once\nThat tells you everything you need to know\nBecause if Kavanaugh Garland who all the Democrats are in love with him and wanted to have on the court\nI'm In and was appointed by Obama and almost his mirror image and judge Kavanaugh\nNominated by Donald Trump what's the difference with the differentiate are there it's obviously Trump this is about two things abortion and Trump hating because\nI mean really cabin other there are more conservative justices that that Trump could have nominated I think numbers are very important numbers tell a lot of the story so remember that going to go next to we have hue and Pennsylvania hello Hugh you're on the air\nAlready so thank you very much oh my gosh you take all my all my topics here\nYou can you can give us a couple [laughter] virtual\nCenter says and cold and flu you know this whole thing was you know watch it everything for the past four weeks with God at all mhm but I didn't know where she was really going to come right\nBut when I watch or listen to a reward for speech ... it was like wow mhm she really put a lot of photos to my at the Susan Collins right you know\nAbsolutely I I think I'm again and it's it's not that great oratory happens on the Senate floor anymore these days you but I just I think that that will be studied hopefully in years to come I mean that's\nThe thing is you know what Melissa ... the thing of it rather than earlier\nIt's it's really this whole thing is about Donald Trump mhm\nIt really doesn't matter what ... what he did in his lifetime his expert geeze mhm we are so divided it's just like\nThe Democrats I I don't even want to call them Democrats the left yes they just want to just destroy this man mhm you know they\nDo and it's funny though few is because it and you know you\nMean you know with the town right like when somebody's line how you know somebody's line there's so many details about the left in in that it's just about pure hatred of Donald Trump is because a lot of the things that he's done we used to be actually core democratic positions under cars are on the ...\nRaces for like the\nOn the TPP right that was a ... that is a status any standard part of the Democratic platform to be against this this international trade that goes all the global\nCorporations with not thought for fair wages and environmental protections and all that right and then along comes Trump and heat that is a good word democratic message and then all of a sudden therefore tee ball because Trump is against it\nExactly but not only that like you said earlier to the ... or you know you are these people that all the Democrats and everything goes what the Democratic Party is not the Democratic party\nFast now it's not this is the left is this is socialism but\nDonald Trump I mean are you kidding me it's about the economy stupid and the guy has lowered the unemployment numbers since Nineteen sixty nine\nIn the last fifty years I think that is what they've been saying right yeah mhm anything\nI mean just look I work at a supermarket and it's owned by Amazon and these people are going to get a three dollar raise because it used to be the base rate was twelve dollars an hour now it's going to go to the game [laughter] and they're all you know slap and five and all but they don't know that Donald Trump is doing this\nRight mhm no pressure mhm\nBut it's because the economy is doing better we are bringing jobs back to this country the economy is really what it's all about\nAnd I thought how capitalism right you know I asked the question I mean um and so in ... they went to compete they're going after raises wages and then\nBut you know what man the mob rule and I mean this whole thing I saw the underbelly of\nReally what politics can really be well it's just they're very vicious getting people like like Marissa today people\nAnd yet I felt like a game for a second Marie Marie ... got\nPeople are watching NFL today right and then watch football games at all politics\nIs worse than that ... I mean they they just want to go for your juggler and that's what people have taken him up\nWell football has some rules right and you get kicked out of the gay and if you don't follow them all the time\nBut what I'm saying it's like people have to get involved and this is where it's like your vote really matters but you don't you you can't be like well I'm a Democrat I voted Democrat for the past Twenty years so I'm just going to vote for you know I'm a Democratic Party and all\nBut you were being hijacked by the left man\nThey are and this this one that he had no like this\nWatching and Jeff Flake being cornered in the elevator by paid by paid people okay\nDid you see the scene where Lindsey Graham is being chased down the hall yeah I mean this is awful and I said it before I thought it last week and I'll say it again if anybody ever did that to me in an elevator what they go to Jeff Flake sexual assault victim or not\nI Would have filed charges for that matter\nAnd assault and and maybe assault with intent to battery I wouldn't like they they have no way being a victim if you even if you are a victim gives you know right to invade someone else's personal space even a U.S senator that what the that was just that was so that was one of the lowest moment I saw\nThroughout like and screaming there is a way to you know you could go to his office you could um you know they could have been very professional they could have gotten the same message across right so it's\nReally not about Republican Democrat it's about like its ideology these people want to take our country and they want to turn it into a ... a socialist country well that's what they want to do\nAnd that's not going to happen if we have anything to say that he landslide at a time you're on the buddy you could hear from you have a good way to buy All right we're going to continue this discussion into the ten o'clock hour you are listening to ... radio ten thirty I Am a ...\nLot happens while you're asleep morning I'm Jonathan Weiner joining on the lawn there how are the Indians around to a\nOf following the news hour on by the time you're getting a having your first cup of coffee right\nUp here to bring all the news from around the world to know whether together any more they accuweather\nResponsibility to make sure you the best ones\nBecause we live here too easy names when the dirty\nW. V. the buses WXXI K. U. S. F. M. H. D. two men and I heard radio station\nBusiest W. B. C. news radio ten thirty were the news was never so [noise]\nComing through the ranks of a male dominated field and fighting those fights or you know plodding along and picking your battles because you have to pick your battles because there's usually about twenty different fights and\nTwenty different sexism friends that you could that you could take on but you really only have if you even have the luxury of fighting one it's a good day [laughter] so\nWhat it used to be it was about women being strong and independent and\nYou basically just people getting out of our way and letting us do what we're capable of doing and not try to grab us you know ... from the from behind not try to put your hand up our skirt or a your tongue down our throats or kiss on the mouth when you're at a bar association meeting yes that happened\nTo me and so I developed really quick reflexes and this person a very well known and democratic circles old left she kind of guy gross just really gross stuff okay but what would you know it's like what was going to do\nUm get on my soapbox in the middle of a bar association though I just turn my head and he hit my cheek and you know then I I always made sure to put my hand out really fast and next time so he'd have to shake my hand rather than coming in for the hug just like you know you develop mechanisms right uh because you just never going to get anywhere if you have to fight that fight every hour of your life\nUm but that's it was basically get out of our way stop touching us without our permission and let us do our jobs and respect us when we do a good job and re Munich rate us when we do a good job at the same rate that you were ... to man pay a man okay that's what feminism was supposed to be about women's rights okay\nNow I mean I just sat there just appalled about the fact that now women are so weak that they can't even be questioned by male senators and I I found that I that is just basically a total low point in the striving for women's rights because\nI understand why the Republicans did I understand the political reasons they had to do and I'm I'm not dissing them for that because I Know what would have happened they they were\nTrying to prevent the onslaught that was coming from the Democrats but the and that's the problem with the Democrats would use that oh here's men questioning a woman who's alleging that she is a sexual assault\nVictim you know what yes what little children\nHave to put that go on the stand and they get questioned by whoever the district attorney or the department of children and families attorney happens to be if it's a man or woman who's there that day um they questioned by both genders and these are children\nThis was a grown woman who was fifty one years old and the point of feminism is that\nUm we even even when we are victims\nYou were going to we we can still be strong and be question because we're when we enter the process that that's what happens when someone's life is at stake when you're when you\nHuge life at the cues person's life and freedom is at stake you have to have a system that is tough\nAnd that is demanding because if you're going to send somebody to jail you're going to ruin that person's life you better bring it you better bring all of it and I know how hard it is I don't know lectures needed about how hard it is been there done that and advocated for people who have been there done that\nUm this is the opposite to say a woman can be questioned by a man is the opposite of the original goals of the women's rights movement\nQuality was about society seen women a strong independent people with thoughts of their own not one standard of treatment for men and then the infantry ...\nOf women that is just unacceptable\nGoing to go right to the phones we have dug in Denver's hello Doug you're on the air\nAnd my dad got drop you okay All right\n[noise]\nOkay I'm not taking these calls of people are just going to try to use it to promo some YouTube they have out there not happening um yeah I I\nI you were wrong ready done with your promo of your you do\nAnd not happening and I really don't want people again I'm I'm In a flag people like that and you're not getting on the air again so David this is not your forum\nFor plugging your YouTube or any other\nUh possible thing you have to sell All right and police on say your names on

fine\nI'm so I'm going to go to Susan in Chicago hello Susan you're on the air\nI'm or is it just a quick question is is much ado about nothing if by chance for all the way we're over turned by the Supreme Court [noise]\nWouldn't the stage than a permit abortions isn't it better for the state's main Illinois that blue state Massachusetts a California isn't it better to get these social issues back to the states and let their people decide Ten Commandments or think it's\nPossible I Do think that I\nI well I think it's um it's over the top for a couple of late for the reason you said but also for the reason that it's not a foregone conclusion even if they have what they think is the fifth vote against roe that it's actually\nGoing to happen because they thought you know they've been playing this card for a long time right first it was it was going to be suitor and Stevens Stevens and Souter and rate\nOf several Republican Justice Kennedy O'Connor\nRight and yeah role has her ... you know it it has made it has remained\nOn the bucks I'm like I say it's gonna you know be forever obviously there have been bad cases that have been overturned as they should have been plus he versus Ferguson of course right fine for sure but\nI don't think I mean I if if you believe if if you do support a reproductive choice and you you do we want to have a standard\nUm that is the same across the country but it also but on the other hand it would force the wood for states to actually take a stand on this issue and if they want to put the right to privacy into their state constitutions right\nAnd that would put it that would shift the burden on to the states to get their act together and they really would have\nTo you know they'd have to have this argument and you know what Susan right now right this very moment as we're sitting here nothing to stop in the states from doing that right\n[noise] nothing at all\nThey can do it tomorrow they could ... they could ... if they want you in their constitutions why are they doing that Susan [noise]\nHere the lawyer\nBecause nobody ever wants to take a stand if somebody else can do it the\nRight around the leaders don't want to do it because they're like oh well row is the law the land why should we bother\nYou were serious about if you were still ... says these soak all these people are right on these advocates you know they would have been on top of this Twenty years ago with their state legislatures and say let's do this do like this and try and get this and try and be preventive right you know in case\nBack up plan right but see but then that would force people at the state level to take a stand and they don't they don't want to talk about choice they don't want to talk about reproductive\nIssues and it's because they're they're wins\nOkay well I I think they are about twenty five blue states I'm sure they would if they were forced to you know my\nMy go ahead with it but that was my quick question of the question [laughter] so um so ... go ahead are you happy with the way it turned out\nOh yes Oh yes but the process was horrible so that way as you talked about [noise] anyway um don't want to

I. D. card right and I as I understand this isn't my area of expertise maybe you know more than I Do um\nI Know that um but they die and with that\nWhile I'm an amateur okay\nUm so that that is I I Do believe that's the way it works and I think it's a bad system because you shouldn't be your your Second Amendment rights shouldn't be beholden to the local officials determination there should be one standard for the state and then\nI'm like you know it starts from many sorry from the federal and then the state officials\nShould then um and that was limitations in in you know in the states but I don't think but that's I'm\nNow that's horrifying that local fish you know a local official could determine your right to own a gun or not because you know\nCurrent events in one more thing that you're um it seems like the Democrats are trying to use violence or violence to get their way ... you have first of all you have the shooting a year ago of of a Republican Congress both have the attack\nThat attack on a or a Rand Paul mhm yeah and er which was a very severe it\nUk law terrible right mhm\nYeah and then you have all these other incidental Barlow so\nI'm\nAlone you know what I mean people all the restaurants will software for Republicans should make a big issue out of this the the dumber clubs or like a bunker extremely well\nI Do I think many of them have and I think any right thinking Democrats should distance themselves in some Democrat out there like I I don't know\nLike a Joe Lieberman somebody in the mold of Joe Lieberman if they're even out there these\nDays I'm needs to come forward and shut down this mob\nViolence and just watching those people and saying shame shame it's like they think they they literally they're taking that from a movie they're taking that from a scene in game of Thrones and it just it's it's a poly like this is a joke to them and they think that they can go down the halls of Congress and in in restaurants I mean they did it to cure send\n'em Nielsen Pam Bondi now recently Ted Cruz it's just not and they were outside um you saw they were having them that beer party in front of McConnell's house you know it's\nI I have a lot of criticism for every single one of those um elected officials but I'll make my criticisms in a professional way right you know if you want to write a letter or you want to get you don't want to lobby or you want to run an opponent against that person those are the mechanisms we have in a democratic society not this mob violence and I am\nThrough our mission we hope to let that positive change for people of all ages\n\n\nYou'll just listen cone and contribute six one Seventy five or ten thirty four eighty to ...\nThis these we can live on WB Z news radio pins are welcome\nBack everybody I'm your host redefined how you're listening\nTo you did the b._b._c. news radio ten thirty were going to\nGo right to we have Larry in Maryland hello Larry you're on the air\nArmory so how do you think how are you\nPretty good um [noise] took your voice something you mentioned Fifteen minutes ago actually looked up ... or say hey to real short\nUm definition but definitely a surprise for me anyway says a pretense it's a male pretense of virtue benevolence or religious devotion mhm [noise]\nI Would have thought that would define sanctimonious gosh um [noise] do you know you know when I first learned about that as a kid apocryphal city and things like that you know getting into a more philosophical things seem better work then for\nWhat I Would call a double standard that people use and politicians are exceptional water above strikes mhm\nOr better word for that then of course she you know the double standard where they want to crucify she did something but they do it and re ... next week\nApple standard um\nNow the guy um and I\nI I have to yeah I I seem to have like a vague memory that there was no other word that was just more\nAnd more apt sorry\nElected outrage\nYeah I've seen a lot of that too and and I say you know I'm not a Democrat or Republican\nI guess I'm more of a progressive person who's also conservative about certain things but that's one of the things that really gets me is that double standard and politicians and people have known\nAnd I'm the best example and I I'd like to hear your [noise] I don't know what your thoughts\nOn it is that a judge Kavanaugh was being defended edge you know he should be afforded the I'm innocent until proven guilty principal ... which I can understand that I think applies at least a little bit in that situation but the people that\nShow the loudest and demand that this be you know strict in viable principal or the same ones who are been screaming for years\nAbout Hillary Clinton and I don't like her personally\nMhm but\nI mean this one was never even been charged with crock\nAnd you've got these people at the at the Republican conventions chanting lock her up lock her up and you're going to throw in jail and she should be in jail and ... and all this I mean it's really really too much because I Am trying trying\nTo be reasonable adults ... and not faint people with a broad brush her condemn them you know made for a\nErrors right but\nI it it's really cannot ear constantly now and that's what gets me is that they're still going that the Hillary saying you bring up something about now what's going on now what about Hillary ... what about this or that\nMay innocent till proven guilty that's your standard and if you can't abide by your own standards\nMy empathy for you and my level of respect for you just goes down show far becomes a a real burden I guess to try to build bridges which I Would much rather do\nYou know well it can lock her up chants is not helpful it doesn't um move the ball forward and uh it's you\nKnow it's basically and it's also a bit of being a store winner I'd say yeah a bit of what a sore winner they while yeah Sheila we won you know I just I mean isn't that sort of like liking the football in the end zone show it\nDown I was a kid ... when I was a kid I played football mostly you know my neighborhood or whatever but it was a big\nDeal back then roughly the sixties or said the mid sixties seventies\nBig thing from your parents your relative your coaches for teachers good sportsmanship mhm\nIt really was a principal that was to be here too and even the boy scouts I was the boy scouts for a couple of years right don't be a sore loser shake the other guy's hand when he beach and you know just give them credit and you know next time we try harder right you know\nYou don't these are what I'd say\nYeah there'll be a short winter either but God I hate it when I see these guys\nAttacking this woman [laughter] and I don't think I can recall an example where they did something like that to a man who had done supposedly the same level of you know whatever it is it's taken him off\nYou need for Hillary storming here this woman was the first lady from from Ninety three to two thousand and she never had a government job mhm and it was supposed to be or they're used to be an unwritten\nOh you don't go attacking the president's family I hear this stuff about Chelsea Clinton and how they used her found the foundation to pay for a wedding and there's no evidence for any of this stuff again this is what burns me up the same people that always worst proof where's\nThe evidence ... ... you know it's a um [noise] I had to have to wrap it up because they got them and it comes to fit in but they're good points and so basically what you're saying is if you if people want the innocent until proven guilty standard they need to apply it across the board and I think that's a very good point you're making 'em just\nBe even handed or try to be because you know what I'm really getting tired all this fighting between people of different political stripes\nRight founding bridges and not get married thank you for ... thank you again You're welcome and I\nAre eight we're going to go next to we have reining main hello Ryan you're on the air\n[laughter] Hi how are you tonight Murray's thanks very\nRon good good good I'm I'm from Maine as you just said and uh I've always liked to call in and I think she did a great job with her speech um and uh explains a lot of things it was nice to hear that um [noise]\nThe au bon this nominee I Can't remember the name Merrick Garland\nMerrick Garland that the that Kavanaugh agreed with Mary ... uh decisions like Ninety three percent I think she named something like that as an attack and so that's all fine but watching this and all of the talking heads on both sides of the different channels ...\nAnd and I think ... you've missed and I'm I'm stuck on it I don't think he should have been approved man\nJust starting this one point alone it really bothers me\nA ... it in his testimony on TV I Believe also in writing to the war thing\nAnd and now handle that topic very gently I Know around here but a lot of people don't know what ... is an directly lied about it but the thing is alcohol in and I think I can say that\nUm I I think most people don't know that ... and the reason that people do that is because the alcohol passes by deliver it gets you drunk or more drunk faster\nSo it's not a stretch to connect the dots between someone\nThat would have been into bull thing to also have blackout and so I'm really stuck on that I Know that if I'm I'm sixty one years old I Know that I knew someone in my undergraduate class that was into that we read the dealers less mhm\nI'm right now I Would hear on on the news\nAnd and tell me run I hate to cut you off but you went to hold on to the eleven o'clock hour 'cause I'm up against the heartbreak and I can we can say this was not sure if you take a hold and I'll be\nBack after this break I'm Reese a different kind of\n[noise] the the real story in\nThe Senate has just voted to approve Brett Kavanaugh as the newest member of the Supreme Court right now the Senate has in fact made it official\nIs a very exciting time but I think he's going to be a great great\nSupreme Court justice relevant\nDaily news radio\n\nW Veasey buses WXXI ... do men and heart radio station\nBusiest WB Z news radio ten thirty for the news was never stuff [noise]\nAnd ... and ... and so I won't say that any more but\nI just want to just come on the ground work what to say I think as long as long as ... let me make my point was an artist but just give it a second\nI no no no I'm not going to cut you off on I just want to I think that uh the ground work that needs to be late is that I Believe he said it was um flatulence is that I think that's correct yeah\nWhich is why ... ...\nIs not flatulence [laughter]\nAnd uh I thought it at one point anyone that said that that was their drinking game I guess not\nI think it's a was flatulence [laughter] and so you know that's lying on the testimony because there are a lot of the other side of the follow up on that and just Google the word the ask them to come to nail down the definition for out of his mouth\nI don't think he would have been confirmed because I Know I'm sixty one years old I'm a physician and I can tell you if one of my cohorts from my undergrad and college a hundred years ago\nUh that I was aware that they did that in college and all was drunk as often as she was and that seems pretty evident he'd been in dispute that too much but it's not a stretch so more than just the alcohol that matter it it it it's skirts around the liver the\nAlcohol goes directly or the look was just I guess you were a mortar on her way more fast\nBoat to connect the dots between that and the possibility of that person that admitted to that at that and then there was that he didn't ever had a blackout is no credible and and I I I I fall\nTo Democrats absolutely for holding on to so permission because I Would have seen a real investigation and nobody followed up on those things that I'm disgusted that someone who was a little thing\nIs now on the Supreme Court which would you not so here's my question to ... would you stand up and be upset if one of your undergraduate cohorts that you're aware that they were pretty big drinker which is an issue an alcoholic by the way if you're doing that you're\nNot drink socially you'll get your drinking to get [noise] crazy drop\nMhm that's an alcoholic mhm\nSo if one of your cohorts with that was a situation and that and then you haven't heard over Thirty years or whatever and then now there's ... to the Supreme Court would offer you\nWell a couple of things I Want to I Want to answer um want to jump back and I answer your question but I I don't want to let what\nYou said go unanswered because you said that it's conceivable that he would have blacked out and it's not credible\nI think that you're likely you know what I said this is the problem like run if you were if you were on the stand and I had to cross examine you I Would I Would really um it it wouldn't well on your side because you're jump you're you're jumping to several conclusions that wouldn't stand up\nUnder scrutiny because I agree that you know really because he might have done that okay and I'm not going to say the word again here's the list of questions like if does it mean that to here's here's because you know first of all I don't know it was it was their slang 'cause I I don't know about you\nWhen I was in high school and college we had our own internal slang right and we would make up words for different things and they would mean things that didn't worth addiction dictionary definition you see what I'm saying right slang in high school and college rights to play for one is that\nIs what you're saying it means is that what they said it means means number two that they said it was they they did this year book as a joke so did they actually engage in this activity\nOr are they just they did the caddy shack and courage and your book I don't know that should have been looked into by that was a senator his job to do that they didn't write too bad for them no matter isn't right exactly embraced survey so number three um if he did in fact\nDo that in ... in high school or college how many times did he do that we'd have to get you know we'd have to get testimony on how\nMany times did you do this and then you know if he did it once it's possible that you blacked out it's possible that you didn't blackout right if you did it ten times as possible you never blacked out at all ten out of ten times are you blacked out five\nAnd a ten times like that and I had a chance that you see where I'm going with it right and so you can't just make that leap from he did agree school air do he must've blacked out because and that's what the send the Democratic senators and I really resented\nRetrained to go with they were saying like because he probably blacked out air do he must have done it you know he might I Know I\nCouldn't agree with you more above my wife is because he admitted to it as an ally what it was\nOkay in my opinion he absolutely like what it was bright\nUm it required more investigation that didn't happen and I blame the Democrats for holding it and that's but that's why the Republicans politics movie with a look it's back as they held it\nAnd then it crossed all of us that we may have a a a an alcoholic person on the on the Supreme\nCourt to answer your questions about when you ask me about my core and then I'll ask but but how do we know that if you even if you were an alcoholic then is there not room to do that he might now Be Sober [noise]\nUm my soul but but ... is that would mean that he's a recovering alcoholic always\nThen and then that would be required as I Am coming clean and say I'm a recovering alcoholic which means he doesn't drink anymore right\nBut he still does so ... so it's either he's a alcoholic and needs to be lawyer who he's not an alcoholic don't you think if you had a drinking problem we know about it\nYou know many people function and and hide it very very very well\nThat I have well aware yes but ... why would we know about it because I mean it was a ... office and then when I'm\nAn answer on 'em because part of Ken Starr team and I'm Harvey Weinstein paid some private detective I don't know how many like tons of dollars to uh do back do apple opposition off all research on all of the people on Ken Starr steam so you know you as well as an alcoholic could hide it I\nDon't think and they found a lot of things about these people like remember Livingston the house the house had to resign because it was found that he was having an affair so they found that I don't you think they would have found out this this

back\nEverybody I'm your hosts ... you're listening to weekend live here on the b._b._c. news radio ten thirty okay so we're gonna go right to you in a moment but I just want to bring up another issue I've I've talked about this actually several times on the air because but it's I Will repeat it until maybe um\nIt gets paid attention to is this giant selective outrage on the side of people on the left and the\nMost I mean there's many examples and he'd go through but Roman Polanski All right I mean you have Harrison Ford right who's oh ah you know so I'm married married to Calista Flockhart and rah rah women and all that stuff\nHarrison Ford went to France in two thousand three to deliver the Oscar to Roman Polanski and the reason why Roman Polanski couldn't pick up his Oscar in our country the U.S in the United states of America is that he raped I Believe it was a Thirteen year old\nAfter dragging her with ... and then refused to stand justice in our country so he just wipe the you know wipes his feet um\nCommits his heinous crime on our soil and then high tells it out of here because he didn't want to be tried in a court\nOf our law disgusting and the people\nIn Hollywood can look at us with a straight face and talk about\nUm what\nRepublicans do I mean it's ghastly okay but that's not where it in because then you've got Whoopi Goldberg on the view and her buddy join bay are you know Joe ... like committing ages them on a daily basis talking about old people old men and um\nIt's like you know you can't you can't engage inequality and fairness if you're going to rant against every protected class because\nYou know if you owned an all women from and you didn't hire men you will be engaging in title seven discrimination joy they hire and if you don't hire people because they're old he ran against people 'cause they're old that's age discrimination so you're oh just so beyond the bounds but whoopee Goldberg in her Roman Polanski moment\nWas this she said quote I Know it wasn't rape rape it was something else but I don't believe it was rape rape he went to jail and when they let him out he was like you know\nYou know what this guy's going to give me a hundred years in jail on not staying so that's why he left [laughter]\nNice nice defensive an actual rapists there will be well done so again you double standard is showing with that we're going to go to Joseph in Lynn\nJoseph you're on the air time every field I I signed the second time caller I still\nDo open form and the show on the medical I'm the blind man from Lynn ...\nFirst one I heard you I didn't like it would give her chance maybe she's standing in the early ... you know you have to get a chance right but yes I have mixed feelings on this subject and I just want to\nSay that for the wealthiest concert she made fun of judge Janine pero because she didn't agree with this that's wrong and then I Want to comment on Brent\nCapital I think that there are other people that were that I wasn't sexually assaulted I was physically assaulted there was a lady who lived in a cage for Eighteen years Elizabeth Smart they some of these people for gave their person thing\nHere is I don't think smart was Eighteen years\nThere was no no the other girl the other girl that was in the cage and Virginia oh yeah she's ... she's married\nAnd well adjusted there was another girl I don't know what was\nIt forgave and moved on with their life which is hard to do but you have to try and do it I Know I forget my parents or their mistreatment of me and as far as I have mixed feelings on women's lib I think sometime it goes too far because I have friends that the women you can't even look at him\nAnd your sister station that the guy in the afternoon fields I think the same way I mean I think you should force yourself on every woman but there are signals you could give you that what the what was the\nOne girl gets me a few weeks ago before restaurant ... everybody was shocked because she kept me I mean\nThe the where I'm coming from too I mean it'd be a little women's lib they had a program on NPR and this woman went into it when you think that\nI'll be a women's lib and she said something to go ahead\nToo far it goes too far she says many kids still need a parent you know but there are some of these women just [noise]\nYou can't get near me don't you look at me you know\nJust to see if I'm gonna I'm gonna stop you right there okay you're being very general these women I don't know these women I must for all women don't make me speak for all women but it's OK things um first of all we don't mention other stations on on our age ... okay ...\nRespect me respect to the studio respect the station respect me as a host of the show\nI'll just say another station you know and\nI don't really care what those other stations are doing I care what I'm doing right now um and so it was not women's lib it's women's rights movement okay it said that you know that's the\nWay I refer to it and no it is when you say when you make a blanket statement like it's gone too far it's like I Can't answer that because", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BZ Flashback",
