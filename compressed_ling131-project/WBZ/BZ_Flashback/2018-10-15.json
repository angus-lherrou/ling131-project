people\nAnd one of the ways that we help people safeguard what they have created an income stream is we use what we call the domino theory and it's really used by some of the greatest universities and some of the greatest colleges here in in the country\nBut that's just one of the many things that we can help people do to protect what they have and you were you were speaking earlier about stress for retirement I read the book maybe four years ago and it took me maybe two or three nights before going to bed 'cause there was so interesting I couldn't put it down and in fact if people call\nNow I'm going to take one step further I I don't know about you Michael my attention span sometimes [laughter] I\nWish that I give me a free book I might not read it\nBut if if they get this book and here's what I'm doing what a bookmark chapter seven seven chapter seven I'm In fact I'm On a book market with a crust one dollar bills or you won't you won't forget it you'll be short opening chapter seven talks about how to lock in your games it's very valuable\nWhen you talk about locking in your gains and means taking a little bit of what the market has given us and then you know again going back to your to rules never taking a loss and that's got to be important because a lot of folks\nI Would imagine are in the position of thinking like you were talking about that client just a a little bit ago he was sixty two and and he ... he can't go back to work\nUh so what he has has to last him for the rest of his life and write to retirement I mean that's that's a scary proposition there\nYou might get one shot at retirement that's at one time have you ever do it a second chance second time chances are something terribly wrong yeah you don't want you you want to make sure that especially like this gentleman sixty two you want to make sure you do it right you want to know your options listen it's it's worked too hard for that money you know\nEight seven seven six three zero eight seven eight seven four your complimentary copy of the book stress free retirement next five radio colors that is a for you eight seven seven six three zero eight seven eight seven to get\nFive to ten years out from retirement incredibly critical time and you guys really tackled this head on with your workshops that are coming up a little bit later on this month and usually\nYou know you guys start promoting these workshops and you guys start to hear feedback this particular time you guys have been hearing feedback about Saturday's give us some Saturday dates give us some Saturday days and you guys have come through again ... you know ...\nHours yeah I Know Saturday October twenty seventh later on this month Saturday October twenty seventh will be at the ...\n... am in the morning no traffic and then Tuesday October thirtieth\nWill be will burn and an noontime start and for um your reservation you can go to again just don't lose the money dot com you can register right on line just don't lose the money dot com John at those workshops we'll talk\nNot only about sort of our standard process of three sixty five retirement plan will talk a little bit about how important it is to understand the sequence of returns what does that mean returns well you know when you have time\nYou can weather the storm and people say John all the time I leave it alone I'll come back\nYeah I mean that for the person who has enough money to let it come back and have the time what happens is will sequence of returns Mike is\nAs a matter of when you want to start making withdrawals from your portfolio what's happening with the full full at that time of the withdrawal writes you if you're lucky\nAnd you have a couple of good use of gains you'll be okay but if you unlucky yeah like if you're in the first year your retirement and it was two thousand and eight and you were lucky the market went down will say forty percent you turn around you took a four percent because that's what you needed to offset Social Security and your arm do you use an income [laughter]\nFloat your portfolio last forty four percent that shocked the money's gone so the flip side if you have a couple of positive views and you're making ten percent for an example and you're only taken over four percent well your principles growing at six percent so the sequence of returns as is critical when it comes time to retire\nAnd I said it earlier here we are ... we all keep thinking the market\nHas lost his legs or what have you and it continues to chug along but the question is where is it going to be when it's time for you to start taking the withdrawals to live your life to all the time\nAnd that's why it's so important we talked earlier about today about the perfect storm of opportunity it'd be nearing retirement listen you've got two jobs\nProtect what you have because you probably have the most money ever a number to create an income plan so part of us three sixty five retirement plan not only shows you how you can pay your bills because the first thing that we do the bed rockets create an income plan but then John you do a great job and helping people choose the right type of investments\nWe put a portfolio together but I Will say don't don't go about it a long look for an advisor look for someone that you trust someone who knows what they're doing ask questions sit down with so and whether it be us another person don't try to go about at all because it's too\nBorn to try to do it yourself as right and you know we we said over and over we we took a team approach to wash almost Thirty years now we've had said to people you can come to one place under one roof and just really get everything that matters and retirement the taxes take a look at that\nYour state plan and make sure that you will as interests are in order on John you help them with their investments try to get you know the best return possible and most importantly\nThe bedrock of any good retirement plan knowing where you're gonna get income for the next twenty twenty five thirty years of your life\nAnd that is a long time and here's the beauty of all this the way I see it is that folks can go

... to everybody's a level of comfort ability in the classroom because next you know it's going to be well math gives me anxiety and I'm a girl so I Can't do math\nSo give me some alternative and\nI Can't do physics because I don't come from um a family that science that with a science background in physics makes me uncomfortable and\nCan't do chemistry because it's it's really anxiety producing and there's too many chemicals to have to remember I I like so so what does that leave us with that is not anxiety producing in high school\nNot sure maybe you can let me know six when seven to five or ten thirty want to hear your thoughts on this so\nThe the problem is and the news flash that I Would have for these kids is that I guess what everybody has anxiety about something and the way you temper that and you work through it is you\nPractice and you do something on a repeated basis until it becomes second nature\nThat's how most people get through life\nIn news flash life's not fair life not comfortable life is often unpleasant life is often downright hard and very taxing but you have two choices you can push through the pain you can push through the tough times and you know hopefully you have at least one person\nWhether it's a parent or a friend or a grandparent or somebody or a sibling that has your back and I hope you do I hope everyone does I Want that for everybody I Want everybody to have at least three or four people like that in\nTheir lives but you know have you represented\nKids in foster care who've been abandoned abused neglected a lot of people have no one and I've seen them persevere I've seen them do amazing things so\nI Know that you can do it to home one air from you six when seven to five for ten thirty if you think that teachers should allow kids should give kids a past do you think everybody think kids [noise] you think teachers should get\nIf kids a pass on oil presentations and let them do something else I I Am a hard no on that because you can't you can't show that you understand\nA lot of material unless you have a conversation about it and you have dialogue and you test your premise and then your teacher might shoot down your premise and then you're going to have to\nUh give another one you're going to have to present your ideas you're going to have to communicate your idea this is the very basis of human communication one of your music twin seven to five or ten thirty so\nWhat what are the options you know instead of doing in our presentation so you do written presentation where you already have to do that in most English and history type type classes but even in science classes that I had we had to do presentations and physics and chemistry in microbiology so\nMath all of them and you know we had to get up and go to the board and solve the problem improve our improve our ... prove the problem and so is that going to translate to you never if if kids don't want to do or a presentations in\nEnglish and history classes then are they going to next say we don't want to go to the board to prove our formula in a math class I just it's really amazing [noise]\nI mean I think that standards

Franco and you are listening to the b._b._c. news radio ten thirty\nThis is we can live with me or is it a Franco All right I Want to hear from you six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty I question for you should kids have to give oral presentations apparently there's\nSomewhat of a movement afoot to have for students to be given alternative options and here's\nHere are some of the let's see here's what some of them are asking for um they might want to present alone in front of the teacher or choose between alternatives like producing a piece of art I'm reading directly from the Atlantic article producing\nA piece of art or an essay for private Judgement instead of presenting the work orally no that's not okay those are not substitutes there's nothing remotely similar to producing a ... a piece of art\nTo public speaking and the same with the essay they are two different skill sets are eight\nSome people who can re really well can't speak at all and they're not good at it but they then they choose not do that for their profession there's some people who are very good at public speaking and not very good at writing again these are two different skill sets and\nOral presentation is communication at bottom line that's what it is and in a world where people's ability to communicate is going right down the toilet as fast as possible you think this is something we should stick to end\nYes require that the ... presentations be given and maybe people should have to go outside of their comfort zone and order if they want to get the a and they want to be a straight a student and they want to succeed in life then you have to produce the skills\nNot the other way around we're not doing a dumb it down so that you can do is comfortable to you because\nWhen you're in a courtroom or when you're an engineer or you're an air traffic controller or you're a\nOfficer or you're in many many many lines of work to actually require you to open

V. the buses WMGK you ... do men and I had radio station\nSo six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty if you want to give a call in and talk about these issues I definitely want to hear from you so\nI'm going to give you a little bit of an overview and this first article it'd be really the title says it all but I'll give you some more of it it it's from New York magazine and so this is the kind of it kind of\nGives you an indication of the type of [noise] I Can't call it journalism uh ... what what do we want to call it slump their dishing out here is the title this is from October twelfth actually a couple of days ago in praise of beta or work the sweaty man [noise]\nSeriously that's the title and you know basically just give you the ... the opening line\nDemocratic Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke sweats and photos with supporters the bit of his shirt is always soaked in Racine Willie Nelson at a rally he lifts his arm to reveal a damp hacked\nHe constantly looks like he should be wearing one of those mylar space blankets that people get after running a marathon\nOh seriously the hero worship about a guy sweating and then the guy goes on and it apparently this writer is a writer for the Jimmy Fallon show I Believe as I suggested out so it's just sort of this this in red\nCompletely insular class and all these so called smart people yes that sarcasm I don't think they're smart but the problem is is they're all ... in control of our lives and it's this little coterie\nThis little enclave between Hollywood and the media and the Democratic party just\nShoving as hero worship in our face twenty four seven and I find it really disgusting and I find this picture Beto O'Rourke in his sweatshirt really disgusting I like it's just it's just ridiculous and then he\nTalks about the writer talks about how sweating did Nixon and as we all know the story people who heard that debate with Kennedy on the radio thought Nixon one people who saw obviously thought Kennedy when Kennedy one\nAnd so history you know went Kennedy's way in that instance so I Want to know if you think this kind of hero worship this kind of\nCool portrayal of Paul political candidates is helpful\nI think it's disgusting because while they waste all of this ain't talking a beta or sweating they can't be bothered to actually write substantive articles about candidates real candidates\nWho worked for a living who oh I don't know maybe have some good ideas you know probably the people who aren't the party favorite probably the people who are raising he raised thirty eight million dollars and of course the writer writes small\nThe way news flash in the case of everybody doesn't get it already when you do an average and you say the don't average donation was twenty dollars yes when you add up thousands of donations of people that gave two thousand and\nFive thousand dollars and then you throw all and the people of whom you gave five dollars it's not that people who are getting five dollars who are deciding the election because obviously\nWhen you do the math that brings the average down but the big donors are the ones who are giving the most of the money it's just that if we could just get rid of that fable\nIn politics I think that would be a big win six when seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine ten thirty I Want to hear from you so\nContrast that right that thirty eight million dollars right so that's not buying ascendancy I don't know what is but then juxtapose that to this email from Tim Ryan who is a a democratic congressman and his he he quotes the Washington Post\nSaying the GOP is buying the house literally\nNo seriously it's\nSo you're going to sit there and ... they're going to sit there and complain about people on the Republican side spending money and allegedly buying races but then you've got to work who I Am sure wasn't raising thirty eight million dollars and grandma and grandpa on a pension I'm\nIt's ludicrous they're all buying elections newsflash six when seven to five or ten thirty triple a nine to nine ten thirty so this this article about sweating man\nIs just one of the one of the pieces I mean you can just Google O'Rourke and unfortunately I'm giving him publicity I Know by talking about him but they tried to have a pretty standard rule of not doing that but at some point we have to talk about\nHow ridiculous these stories are but the part of his history that isn't getting highlighted is you know the guy was arrested for DWI and then he lied about it\nSo in this whole ... in this whole is going to say kerfuffle that's not the right word and this whole screaming\nMatch over the last two weeks about Brett Kavanaugh allegedly lying about drinking in high school and maybe and in college and like everybody's like he finally find anything\nThe standard does it also apply to a democratic\nCandidate I think we call that a double standard and I'm not okay with that and go into some of these\nDetails a little more but you know it's bad when he was trying to back out of his claims when the Washington Post gave him four Pinocchios calling I'm basically a big fat lie or any of course the Washington Post as the\nNewspaper of record for the Democratic party six and seven to five or ten thirty triple eight nine to nine
