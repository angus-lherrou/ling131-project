{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBZ", "content": "Well that's why we go to these workshops their attended by you know forty fifty sometimes a hundred people and you if you want to be shy you can sit in the back but you were going to give you a lot of great information you sort of can take a first brush it hey maybe I haven't done this so I've done a good job and who knows\nBut it's an opportunity for people to get more educated and again let me just shut up those dates Saturday October twenty seventh\nWill be in debt I'm ... and Tuesday October thirtieth will be and will burn and if you want more information you can you do need to sign up you can get your reservation go straight to our website I just don't lose the money dot com again it's just don't lose the money dot com\nSame I got to interrupt you here because I I spoke with Bobby as of late and and there's a limited amount of seats are remaining yeah so they got to go to\nJust don't lose the money dot com very quickly yeah that one's at twelve o'clock at night so I think people are trying to sneak on and their lunch hour and work maybe yeah so again just don't lose the money dot com where you can come to learn more about what you need to do in retirement you know we were talking about the perfect storm of opportunity but also Mike I think the one thing we want to bring up is\nA lot of times people don't have an exit strategy [laughter]\nYeah I sat down with someone last week a Sam and they had they actually were retired and they had a million dollars in their four O. one K. and they were just planning on withdrawing a four percent I said well what happens if in four percent was an forty thousand a year sure that's what happens at the market drops ten percent that four percent becomes thirty six thousand dollars\nWhat are you gonna do that that's not enough or it's getting close to the point where it's not enough right they didn't really think like some of the wall is that\nRight oh you if you want the forty thousand now you have to draw out more than four percent I remember I I met these people maybe like ten years ago and\nIt was a situation where there was nothing that I could do they came in and they said look you know we've got a million bucks just like your example ride we need to take out forty thousand dollars a year\nThey're broken tells them hey no problem you know we've done quite well and the market's done you know eight percent on average you know I've done even a better job you've earned even a little bit more no problem with the problem was they retired in two thousand\nAnd for the next three years the market went down\nAnd down and down\nBut they still need to pay the bills so they're drawing a forty thousand dollars a year for three years in a row and by the time they came to us they had like five hundred and fifty thousand bucks\nAnd now they need to draw forty thousand dollars in five fifty Ryan you know I'll be on the spot what's that math vets them percent yes just shy and that's like a Ninety percent down nine percent withdrawal rate and you know what no matter what you do is not going to work for an extended period of time so you don't really want to put yourself in that position and that's the whole idea of understanding\nAuctions understanding\nA allocation models for as you grow the money understanding what Reagan's our retirement income generators now you can diversify income source and really having an extraction plan you know we met some folks the other day\nFor a review their clients of ours have been caused Russia maybe ten twelve years\nHe's a dentist by trade successful practice but he's a solo practitioner and he said to me saying you know I'm like four years away from retirement you've done pretty good job with the stuff helping me understand what I'm going to get income from\nBut my my business is worth a lot of money and now I'm taking a steps to bring a new partners I'm looking at different options may be selling my business or maybe bringing in a junior partner and I can I can take to reduced role and maybe less make less money but I was still income coming in he's thinking about an exit strategy\nNot like the month before he retired she's thinking about an exit strategy five years before he wants to retire surf so that's the whole idea for folks that you know work for some corporation you don't just\nNot sure if work one day and think the rest of your twenty Thirty years is going to be fine you have to have a plan of attack\nSo saying let's talk about that plan of attack and and again I Want to remind everyone listening or now about the uh five steps to a successful retirement workshop that's coming up Saturday October twenty seventh addendum Hilton in debt

that some of us\nHere and others are born in other countries of course in a philosophical universe yes that is unfair okay life is unfair\nAnd that does not mean that now we have to capitulate our rights as us citizens to our safety we have to forfeit we have to forfeit our lives and our safety because the place of birth of other people was unfortunate no that's not how the world works\nAnd if we don't get a handle on it it's going to be our downfall for people who think that civilizations can last forever I mean come on crappy history book would you please it do with all of a

Franco here on weekend live on WB Z news radio ten thirty were talking about caravan lines two point oh just four months after the first one of this year fiscal year calendar year and\nBoth are slightly different but this this this is the second one\nAnd both of those time frames and it is a dastardly absolute lie that everyone fleeing is coming here for asylum there's a lot of criminals by the way\n... illegally is a crime so every person who went through the legally is\nYes a criminal let's just get that out of the way right now number to\nBuy the pathologist global is calculation oh you know these people are coming here because of the threats from gangs All right you want to go with that analysis well then why can't the people from Chicago in Detroit who faces kind of violence every single day in the city's why can't they flee to Canada\nWhy can't they just be let in and you know just go cross the border and get everything they get access to everything candidate has to offer or better yet\nWhy can't they just go into the nice\nRate reached the Tony neighborhoods of people like Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren over there in Cambridge and just come in and squat on their lines in or open their doors and say hey we're here you know with their bags packed were fleeing gang violence and Detroit in Chicago\nYou have to let it then you must you must you must I mean you're the very few humanitarian people\nThat say that illegal aliens can do this at the border so why can't we were us citizens right right and and and a lot of them descendants of slaves even why shouldn't they be allowed to go into ... all of these\nMostly white neighborhoods because all the Democrats living the mostly white richest neighborhoods in the country and just say hey we're here but I I'm I'm for that\nI'm an I'm announcing right now in for that everybody out there if you're listening to me in Chicago in Detroit or even in Boston here and you're having a tough time and you can't get any justice or fairness in your neighborhood go go into those neighborhoods in Cambridge and\nAnd and test this theory really\nI mean tell me tell me how that's ... that's incorrect because that's that's exactly the analogy that all these global list apologist the illegal immigrants illegal migration are supporting that that they're supporting we're going to go to we have re law hello ray you're on the air\nAnd well thanks how are you re I'm One of your biggest fan but my biggest\nAlready okay there's a competent healthy competition is always good to\nStart and I always felt it written there I I Will [laughter]\nOh good good good I'd how dare you make such you know\nMy ... mayor culpa here called ...\nBut I Want to touch I won't take up much of the time but I appreciate the ah the opportunity to talk for a moment of it um\nYou know like your your last one big on immigration but uh the last caller I Believe what was your last caller mentioned something about the second amendment I just wanted to but I'm not really you know we all saw the video what happened in Portland, Oregon I'll do what people\nDon't people trying to get to work just trying to go to support their families just up and you have this in yes I'm going to say the N word mob mob that's what it is an as offering them stopping them in traffic ... cards and stuff like that yeah so that anyone you know here in the People's Republic of Massachusetts\nAnd anybody goes to um you know their local cliche or what have you in all the if they qualify otherwise of course you know like I mean not criminals and\nI'm not the range do what I mean if they go and they apply for a permit to carry right I mean I Would take a copy of that video in Portland and go like this is why I as a citizen need to be on because these people were citizens they were trying to get to work and you didn't see a Portland police officer anywhere doing anything\nThat was terrible I mean these people were at the mercy of the mob you know so I mean you if you can't protect yourself\nYou know like this I'm a retired police officer who used to say it used to say you know when one second scout ... minutes ... minutes away Reno right and it's terrible you have to be able to protect yourself you know\nYou do and the uh the go ahead\nBut that having been said just to address the immigration thing which is why originally called you know I I think it would be wonderful if somebody had the goal of the guts I Would call it God's will and gall to publicize Elizabeth Warren's at rush\n[noise] I remember how are you I'm well thanks Maureen how are you\nI'm good I'm given a conservative estimate mhm ten percent of illegal aliens or criminal ten percent of the five thousand coming across the border [noise] don't have good intentions mhm\nFor every person that was saying to the planning on pulling the lever for a Democrat mhm [noise]\nThey had to make sure that they get down on their hands and knees and pray to God every day [noise]\n... mother father brother wife daughter son [noise] it's not killed by an illegal alien [noise] mhm [noise] or is charged with a crime without due process\nBecause that's exactly what they're going to get if they vote for Democrats [noise]\nPretty much an argument that Maureen and you know everybody will say oh you know you have everything\nI can hear the the uh so aggressive screaming out there about always you know queen immigration with criminality and two that I say you know like you just said whether it's five percent or ten percent or whether it's even one percent it matters because we already\nLike you know we the prayer you said Maureen we say this prayer to that our loved ones aren't aren't victims of US citizen criminal we got an right right right you got enough so it is not racist to say like we already own that we know we have\nCriminals who are U.S born and bred many generations here right got enough of those we don't want any and it's\nWhen we're when you're talking about like you said the numbers\nUm you know you got to keep in mind Nineteen hijackers for nine eleven Nineteen radically to to terrorists in San Bernardino right one in Orlando and I know people say they're going to land a guy was born in the U.S and if you know of course his family came from\nUm a ... in Afghanistan exactly um and so like those are only the examples off the top of my head\nAnd all it takes a few completely and he\nSaid ... percent that's a that's a conservative estimate\nIt it is yes and I actually I Will do on a future program and I've written about this before about um you know the the falls numbers that are out the out there including like from places like the Kato instituted who argue that\nThe number is small not no it's not and I will show and we'll talk about a\nLater date I'm usually I'm and using and I use actual\nUm numbers from the so called whatever progressive or liberal to show how their numbers actually demonstrate that the number is higher grade liberal criminality is higher than what they say you're ... right marine\nOne more thing I have to say I'm Still waiting for your podcast [noise] I Know\nYou can you can zip and email over to this I have time to thank\nYou um I we we're we want to get working on that so um you and me both Maureen\nI'm not getting any response from them\n[noise] All right but I still keep the mailing them I really appreciate that and if more people want to buy gas absolutely please everybody jump on board but I Will express Maureen Moreno fuss you risk your displeasure to\nPlease do people in would love to be able to listen to you thank you Mari every Sunday night I Wish it was more ... oh\nWell right now one once a week is you know we we\nGrowing do you have another job hard not to do that every Marine I super appreciate\nThe um the voter confidence and you know as soon as we get the pie cast up and going you'll be the first to know on air\nThank you very much Marie and have a have a good night thank you Bye bye\nOkay we are next going to have you in PA hello Hugh\nOh finally ... person\nMan how you doing more research to ... his own girl\nThat's right well I Know [laughter]\nBut I Love your short list with every Sunday night thank you and I was a really special because um I didn't really hear you before talk about like this is really a ... law mhm\nThat were ... people don't understand I mean Donald Trump and you know what it's not Donald Trump it thought about it because we learned back in ... in the Clinton era right mhm\nIt doesn't matter what the person is what is morals or we learned that you know\nOh I faced with that a long time ago Hugh when people like to like I just don't understand why people can't get it in their heads and that ah when ... when the economy's going well or Paul yeah these are being affects you waited that people like right Americans will take the policy over the person I mean it owning your world view I Want the\nPerfect person at the perfect policy but I'm Shockley haven't done that hasn't come across yet so we\nWe lower back and Bill Clinton\nCharacter didn't matter back then well let's apply with Donald Trump but the thing of it is ... ... thing of it is what we're dealing with today and it just happened just so closely it was like a week ago Donald Trump said Mexico\nIf you let this caravan come through here on earth put our military on the southern border and we are going to stop trading with you mhm\nGuy on the doors were not going to give you money rain and all of a sudden it stopped why because we have someone in this country who putting America First it's that simple\nIt is now viewed as leaders is exploited to five five thousand so you know it's just like and they just you've seen the video where they just they just don't this is an invasion\nYeah but what I'm saying is Donald Trump let's say and bring it on we are going to take on the fight and Donald Trump also knows that politically if he thought this was going to like kill is a\nPolitical stance he would not be doing this but he's not a politician you know\nNo ... well again for all of his lies I mean this is the one thing that is you know it's it's it's the policy first and the policy is you know you have to protect the borders of the country are you have no country and that's not just a cliche it's actually true\nI Know it when I was like people you know the guy Charlie tonight I Love Charlie burden before but he's like oh but he's such a you know I don't really like the way he approaches things as moral outlook and everything but I Love what he's doing in this country listen he's putting America First\nIf we don't do this in our history right now I don't know what this comes as go look like\nYou have it surely is one of the good guys you know and that's all I don't mind if you you know if he has a different opinion of Trump or doesn't necessarily like his character he's still on board with his policies are going to take like ... you know we want to keep our ally\nWhat I'm saying is Donald Trump is doing and what these people really want our country to do you know we have to we have to fight for our you know we're a country we need borders we fight for our borders\nWell and it's it's very simple hue and this started back in Nineteen sixty five and this was the Democrats' plan when they pass the immigration nationality act because it has become rightly or because they they stopped they stopped having ideas they stopped running on issues and they just\nSociety will just import a whole bunch of people from third world countries and get them to depend on the government and become lifetime that Democrat\nExactly and the thing is the ap said this before you and I'm I'm coming up on my brain I Want to finish this up with you\nUm is that you know who the real racist because in Nineteen sixty five what's important about that day that date is important for black

by the time when they brought in Mexico in ...\nWhat they failed to do is initiated um the standard of living clause which President Trump has just into the NAFTA agreement there renegotiated NAFTA agreement the place is a school and what that is is is if\nGM for example if you have a GM plant\nPhil Ontario and one in Michigan right they're making the same way of saying basically the same the same plan right\nAnd Mexico for one question and and um Clinton brought it in there making like two bucks right and so what happened was prosperity\n... wasn't able to grow in the lower America's not they've done nothing and the Institute of the claws but any future company from Canada the United states\nThat opens up an office or manufacturing facility in the lower America's they maintain that

it was addressed and it was addressed brilliantly in sixty one but President Kennedy and ah\nIt's actually in ... sorry Richard if you're just an excellent point you're absolutely right but see if they had done what you're saying right to include the standard of living claws well then all those corporate donors on both the left in the right for the Democrats and Republicans you know they

I mean if you will wake in her basement for you it's a good idea to stop the flow the water running and then you deal with your deal with the rest of the wars on the poor exactly exact off but I\nKnow that the optics are going to be back here but um I mean fortunately we got the white white guy and all touched because you don't want\nI mean let's be clear we don't want to enter into international incident to be created so but once they step foot over our border um let's\nSee well but there are I disagree with you because then then they're hamstring do the same you know ... capture and release you know I mean that's the I I Believe it needs you know what I mean they they should try to I mean at that point and Mexico can't deal with these people and and you have your five thousand people\nSo I ... and they're getting ready to move across start hitting them with ... ... ... it's all on right there I I don't want to see the situation where where are our troops are are are drawn to you know had got these people\nOr I don't know right well see I'm that's not my area of expertise you know the sanctity of um the the foreign soil and looks if they're coming approaching if we have our border\nAre CBP or if the military if that's possible and they are at the border and um you know obviously international there is international law we can't step into Mexico um as as they're charging though as the as the invaders are charging um at what point thanking the CBP like you said throw tear gas and protect our land\nAnd you know again I you you know that I'm an expert and a lot of things but if I not a hundred percent sure or something I have to check that out\nAnd I'm for ah you know where that puts us in a straight jacket of course but I feel like if we have our border officers lined up on the border um you know so it's an impenetrable force and then they can push back push to people back into Mexico we should be able to do that\nWell what's her what's you know and I'll tell you what a two weeks or your vote for a Democrat gr for just a flat out through but I think we ought to be\nAny less what's it like all put up a print these in that any Democrat who do I mean I don't know I haven't found one yet you can tell me if you do if there was a Democrat out there who actually supports border for has been an immigration security\nMy question is what this ... is providing food sanitary facilities and sleeping arrangements for then\nI don't know I didn't get along with the foreign black lives matter I think it's George she's pumping money into these things in creating\nA lot of people yet I I've seen that common um that's like again it's quite possible I wouldn't doubt it but I don't want to say anything with any specificity unless I\nYou know can source it properly\nIs there any mechanism that we can do this guy is a citizen [noise]\nWell it's an let's take a step back for a second though also um the in addition to him it's quite clearly I'm sure coyotes and cartels are involved as well I don't think I Need proof of that\nUm him and make an educated deduction on that Jack I'm\nSo as far as ... goes it some\nYou know it's like it's is it is very amorphous because he's not breaking any laws um so how what we the only the only town or that we have to someone like him is to win votes at the ballot box for candidates who have strong stance on immigration I mean that's\nWhy Donald Trump one and twenty sixteen and you know for a lot of people that don't like a lot of things about him the one thing that\nI'm United a lot of voters you know and for all the people out there who want to say was racism you know I think a lot of black conservatives that you've seen talk about this or I'm Hispanic conservatives are Asian conservatives and um people from all across the the\nRacial spectrum Ron bore with Trump for one reason and one reason only because he took the security of the country seriously whereas um most of his opponents did not a few other Republicans were strong on immigration but not as strong as he was for his\nWell that's certainly true\nSorrows give money to the Democratic candidate for governor in ... between him and some other guy is going to run for president in the tone of six hundred thousand dollars\nI mean this is max on campaign contributions\nThere is except for then you have these dark or these dark organizations to five to seven is a whole complicated um like that'd be a full time job for me to just follow that\nBut you know the dark money that they talk about and so the world that you bring up a good point jak if there were if you and again campaign finance violations might be away my age you know that some\nYou know sort of how they got out on on taxes right right right and if there are people as we speak who has you know her being prosecuted for campaign violations that could be a way but my preferred way jak you know they sort of\nYou know through the back and forth as of all of that money and everything is my preferred way and this is why I ran for office and the first place my preferred my preferred solutions are always the lasting solutions and the only solution I can see out of this mess jackets for American people to wake up start reading about the people they're electing and elect a smart\nPeople who maybe they're boring or maybe they actually show up for everything and maybe they're dependable and start assessing candidates on that and not how much money they raised and assessing candidates on their ideas and assessing candidates on their character and unless and until American started doing that for themselves\nRight really keep having this conversation but like when Iran jak it's like you know how incredibly pie as incredibly lazy people are because they would say to me oh I didn't know you were running\nOkay in the maybe like Thirty years ago when you didn't have the Internet that might be valid right but in two thousand twelve and two dozen fourteen has this thing called the Internet and websites right and all they had to do is look at the party website and see who the candidates were and do their own homework\nBut they just continue to allow themselves to be fed by the media that has an agenda\nTo work it weren't for\nIran for us then and twenty twelve I was in the race ten months before dear old Liz and um you know there were six other men and all those chickens ran away when she got into the contest I said I I went all the way to the end and then I got word it at the convention\nThe\nWhole other story that jak will keep up the good work I enjoy listening to your excellent thank you for calling in have a good one vote early and vote often\nAsked thanks jak they get I buy\nAll right next we're going to go do we have Rick in New York Hello Rick you're on the air\nCameras are born with a breath of fresh air you are to hear you every time when I listen to a couple of times a month to nice to see somebody broadcasting more of a similar to the truth and you hear on most of the talk radio\nAny rate is one of the called Bush or know that in two thousand and one ... air was under a George Bush and sixty five hundred people armed troops down to the border to repel\nObama twelve hundred okay so they have the authority to do that and I hope the Trump followed through with that\nHow many was that for Obama Obama was only twelve hundred twelve hundred at the border say\nAll right he thinks for that and get it you know create that on fighting the good fight\nAnd I hear people like Jack and the other ones have called and I say God she's making a dent or at least there are some people up there with an open mind\nYes we're not we're not a monolith not even in Massachusetts\nAnd I think that I think I think ... I think it was Sarah Rose money but I Can't I wouldn't want to be quoted on it because I Can't prove it but you know there are things that I'm very you know I mean they ended up the conservative [laughter]\nOtherwise bring back the house un American activities ... and ... ... they won't do that that that's like what we did with the commie hunting in the fifties you know\nRight well there you know and there's a lot of like and that's a mix it's just that story always gets a little bit mixed up because you know there actually were communists size and it is not in it is not improper for us to go after communists fine I mean that it it got out of hand I\nAm like with every some things get out of hand but that doesn't mean that the original goal of rooting out actual spies like you know die and find things find science communists but I mean Chinese Communist by re her driver you know right is appropriate for us to go after those people right\nDefinitely definitely I think I think that uh you know they should be a little bit\nMore of that kind of thinking and the world but um you know I'm old fashioned so like I said [noise] but uh you know we just gotta I Wish that Americans in general would just grow a spine because if you have a house\nAnd there are some people that move and across the street you don't know who they are but they living across the street\nAnd after a while you see they're nice people you can invite him into your house great if they come in and and knock down your door and come into your house say they're gonna they're gonna feel a blast of a shotgun that Dan head off I wouldn't even think twice about it and that's the thing we're too much of a soft touch as a country\nWe've got now on the books all Evan thousand eleven million\nIllegal immigrants here but we're not twenty two is the actual thing that they did and they said it could be as high as thirty million was only three hundred million of us that one out of ten is illegal and say that I'm not saying that for any kind of a thing but\nIf there's that many people that came here and they came here from other places and they get free education and they get welfare and they get food stamps they get all these things what do you think they they do when they write a letter home they say it's terrible here\nYou know they say it's wonderful and then five more and more people are on our do you got it got it and they have no what do you think\nWhat what do you think would happen if you know we shot some people if you put a thing you know like nobody nobody snakes and area fifty one you notice\n... there are signs and I'd like to just idly instead of shooting people I'd just like to build the law and making me too me too it deportation of people who break the law but they are explained this was that I wrote a Boston Herald out that about this back in June and wreck and it was called illegal migrants exploit us weaknesses exactly what you're saying\nUh you know and so we are soft and we need to get um we don't need to be violent we just need to enforce the laws we already have\nLike ... I'm I'm I'm all for an awful legal immigration at welcome at you know I think it's the country needs to remain vital\nAbsolutely recommend against the heartbreak but I Want to let you go by thank you thank you Bye bye\n[noise] All right I Know you're on the line so if you're on the air please be patient I Will get you in the eleven o'clock hour we're going to continue this discussion ...

S. conflict may not be safe ground for you\nSo traditionally that isn't what happens a lot of people do flee they come through the you know the come to the to the un\nA legitimate port of entry whether it's an airport or a border port of entry and they claim asylum as soon as they enter\nAt a legitimate port of entry that actual aside and it's a very very tiny tiny tiny percentage of people that qualify for that but it does happen and it is that the very small\nAnd then when you hear country are you not supposed to go to the next country\nCorrect the neck of the country so that's very that's why I mean it's a tiny tiny tiny portion so you say and some people you know some people that claim asylum do\nCome from do have means you know so they actually can purchase a chicken an airline ticket and they do they make a direct flight um you know from their country again that is extremely rare extremely right\nSo how is it that these people are much and true too and the three countries to get to a place and I've watched the film with the three days now I'm telling you I just want to throw up right every single camera and every single person\nThat has been interviewed on camera ... not one person said it's too dangerous you know just to back up when you file a restraining order mhm ...\nMagic words are I fear for my life right mhm basically right okay I've I've dealt with enough restraining orders when you are fleeing the country\nThat when you stick a microphone you don't say well we want a better job ... you know we want to live better no that's not why you enjoy the country illegally I mean I Am she's so mad I Can't even begin I'm getting nail ... watching these marches\nAmericans should be but they haven't see those people haven't ... haven't been I

what to say I say it\nRight yeah it'll be parroting the proper lines and this is why this is but again it's that's why I'm calling it out because of people were truly fleeing persecution like you said and like I've said many times they will go to the first country of safety and they've passed\nThey ever passing through Mexico they can claim asylum there they can also go south right they could go to
