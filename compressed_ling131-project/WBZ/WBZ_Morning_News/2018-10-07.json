have pledged their love\nWe pledge our love to you this day\nMake our lives beer witness\nGrant this wild Lord Jesus Christ your son lives in rains with you and the Holy Spirit\nOne gone for ever and ever and\nListen now to a reading from the holy gospel according to mark\nSome ... approached Jesus and asked\nIt against the law for a man to divorce his wife\n[noise] they were testing can answer them\nWanted Moses command you [noise]\nMoses allowed us they said to write up a rid of dismissal and so to divorce\nThan Jesus said to them\nIt is because you were so an teachable that he wrote this commandment for you but from the beginning of creation God made the male and female this is why a man must leave father and mother and the to become one body they are no longer to the fore but one flesh so then\nWhat God has United\nMan must not divide [noise]\nBack in the house the disciples questioned him again about this and he said to them\nThe man who divorces his wife and Mary's another is guilty of adultery against her and if a woman divorces her husband in Mary's another she's guilty of adultery too [noise]\nPeople were bringing little children to him for him to touch them\nDisciples turned them away but when Jesus saw this he was indignant and he said [noise]\nLet the little children come to me do not stop them for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God be long\nI tell you solemnly anyone who does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child she'll never interest\nThen he put his arms round them late his hands on that\nAnd gave him his blessing\nIn many places these days there is\nA lot of concern over the increasing divorce rate some psychologists are pointing out that divorce does not solve problems but\nOpens up an avenue of temporary escaped\nThey have observed that after divorce the trauma of failure remain\nWith loneliness and guilt is constant reminders of what might have been [noise]\nFamily counselors have long maintained that children need the loving guidance\nOf both parents [noise]\nAnd they insist that divorce destroys a part of a child's birthright\nAnd jeopardizes future happiness\nThere is a growing awareness among some at least that the relaxation of divorce laws is a favorite to no one\nIn the gospel we saw that Jesus took a strong stand against divorce despite the practices of his day they stand was unpopular then and it remains unpopular even\nTo this day but he continues to be opposed to divorce\nThrough the church\nPosition on the permanence of marriage is not based on a legal lipstick approach on whether there is a law which either forbids or allows divorce it's not even based primarily on the harm done to children in society by divorce rather it's based on the fact\nThat section and fulfillment in marriage are God's idea are God's creation and that from the beginning God intended marriage to be a last\nThe relationship between one man and one woman\n\nJesus has in his mind the beauty and the meaning of a relationship as expressed in these words from the book of genesis they are no longer too but one flash\nThey are no longer too but one flush this simple statement and understood and developed by the long tradition of the church means that in God's Plan\nThe relationship the physical relationship particularly if a man and woman married as opposed to say something it's intended to express something so profound that words I mean adequate for it\nI Love you completely exclusively and forever I Love you completely\nThat is I give myself to you without holding anything back and I accept you just as you are with all of your thrilling qualities as well as your human shortcomings\nLet me speak very plainly but seriously\nWe called ourselves this morning not only to keep warm or to follow the current styles but because we do not belong to each other\nWhen a husband and wife express their love in a most intimate way they appeared before each other on clogged because they hold nothing back they belong entirely to each other I Love you exclusively\nSince I've given myself to you completely I cannot give myself to anyone else\nIs does not mean that I'm not interested or concerned or noticing other people but it means that my relationship is unique with you\nThere was no one in the whole world toward am I feel the same I Love you forever you are so precious so valuable to me I never want to lose you\nThis is what makes marriage a sacrament between baptized Christian\nWhen you love someone this way you think that person\nIs particularly special but you also think that you're pretty good yourself since you would not give yourself you would not give yourself as something worthless to a person you love uniquely and since you think that you are both quite worthwhile people\nYou instinctively wish to see yourselves repeated and continued in other your children children are not an intrusion on marrying law\nThey are it's finest expression and its completion\n\nI Love you completely exclusively and forever this my friends represents a very high ideal of love\nThe relationship they've done as in mind cannot be entered into lightly or in any kind of a temporary basis and because it is such a high ideal we should expect to find that the ideal is not easily reached\nThere are many failures along the way\n\nIn the popular novel love story which became an equally popular movie painted a contemporary picture on film of a relationship as old as our human race itself\nSome people ... while admitting certain beauty in this tape and have objected to it on the grounds that people do hurt the one they love real deep love is not something that happens all of a sudden it's something that has to grow even in the middle of personal shortcoming\n\nWell marriage for us and raising a family\nIs not just a sign of what we expect to find in God's kingdom that love that fulfillment that piece that perfect
