admission by Saudi Arabia\nJamal ... is dead uh they said that he died in a fistfight or some kind of a confrontation at the consulate in Istanbul believes Saudi consulate\nUh and uh so there are still many questions president says he believes their story and um we're going to explore that today and then there was the debate last night between Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren\nAnd Jeff deal who's the Republican running against er and they discussed the ... um\nStory and so they debated that among other things including her DNA test and all of that\nI'm not allowed to ask you and if

were not allowed to have ah an artist and opinions where we do have analyses of the situation and ah I'm hardly an expert on Saudi Saudi Arabia and us relations [noise]\nAh but it uh it very clearly seems to be something that has got the entire ah international community up in arms against Saudi Arabia and uh that means the U.S probably has to do something\nWe know I don't know what they were duplicitous in September eleventh all those years ago and I just feel uncomfortable taking them if they work this is me I'm not in news so I can make a comment like that\nWell I you know I can also uh I can also a expressed skepticism as a journalist who covers these issues I don't have any problem with that uh but I wait to see what the facts are if there are more facts to come out one has to keep an open mind\nAs to nine eleven um you know I don't know I I I Know that\nSaudi Arabia most of the high ... fingerprints on where I'm of those issues the Mohammed Atta and the rest of them spent time in Saudi Arabia\nWell a lot of them were Saudis yeah yeah but most of them were Saudis and so that raises the\nQuestion Saudi Arabia is a a\nA kingdom it's a dictatorship ah\nAnd also a very very ... they practice a very conservative form of Islam\nA which they have a spend money spreading around the globe right and so in some ways uh they're very conservative Islam uh may be related to a terrorist groups around the world we don't know when we go no we don't know\nAnd they cover their tracks relatively fairly well I mean this is very simple they have oil\nAnd we needed their oil for a while I don't know if we needed as much anymore right they do supply the world with a lot of oil and that's why they get away with what they get away with I think it's as simple as that\nThank you for
