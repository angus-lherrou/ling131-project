I like getting another ... drivers because they give you the insight on how much harder it is to do that job and you think it is tough like if you you're going to be on the job for Thirty years and you make one mistake I could go on five miles and over the speed limit when somebody runs into you then you're on the hook big time\nYou can't make a mistake and you can imagine imagine driving a bus you gotta drive not run into bikes not run into cars not run into people make sure they pay make sure they're not drinking or fighting\nBack there are smoking we'd\nHave to do all this while you're driving there's a lot as even the white and I was into it yeah they are hating on you and you know what it by the way it takes five seconds to say Hi or thank you on your way off you know yeah there\nThere there are people just like everybody else that's a long run as to your description on the tea when you got to watch the intersections and there's a lot to do full plate so you are\nAt a lot of experiences have you ever experienced a ghost or something you think might have been a ghost\nYes really yes where twice a once in a Scotland but we're not allowed to drink and that we're being fed all this information all night so you're you were hypersensitive to it I I Would be\nI I was less sure about that but we were in Maine a visiting some friends is a long time ago we were kids you know high school college\nMissing some friends who are working at this in and uh they asked us to run upstairs and grab their copies and we're standing on the top top for all the staff works you know the waiters in and house cleaners and whatnot I Walk into this room\nThe radio turns on and the shade whips up\nAs I'm going in to get the keys really yeah and then I turn around and the door closes and I'm and I'm looking for my friends thinking this is all big spoof there's nobody on the whole for but me\nSo I booked out of it pretty quickly yeah that was weird Ashford so a couple things coming up Halloween and trick or treating trick or treat stuff that's\nWhat that ISIS thirty hundred already tomorrow night yeah and so you're stocked up I Am really I'm I live in a place now where it's like a lot of different apartments altogether so this'll be my first so we usually see how this works know when you went trick or treating did you ever trick did you ever do the trick\nNo evidence but when kids used to come to our house my parents were big fans of Halloween so my mom would dress up like a which we lived down to ... you know fairly long driveway with some woods and and the previous owners had left they rotted swing set you know those those metal swing sets wings that end of the heat are taught I Am your finger right [laughter]\nSo we would stick that in the middle of the driveway\nAs a deterrent\nSo the kids would have to ... them navigate the rusted swing said yes then get to the house and we had one of those low Russo we'd put somebody on the roof to dangle their arm over it and we'd high people in the woods to just nuts boom but just step out in like\nZombie like and scare the heck out of kid it was that you can tell and then the parents would bring the little kids and they'd be the ... little children ... little children coming like you know dial it down a little bit so we'll scare kids selling surprised that they still do that kind of stuff today everything being so\nYou know make sure you don't offend or scare or do anything I think it's exactly because of that that when people do it and and there again you're you're you're you're modifying depending on who's coming down the driveway it's fine\nLittle fun OK before you go what\nCan you tell us about the w._b. the coverage of the big parade\nAnd Red Sox for a ... well it's ... o'clock

fostered cohesion with his organization not division and ... there was no backstabbing Don dropping or other signs of contempt\nAnd perhaps most important of all Cora model humility always sharing
