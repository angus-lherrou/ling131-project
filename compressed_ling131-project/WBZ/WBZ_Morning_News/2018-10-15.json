{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBZ", "content": "[noise] first everybody on the radio I listen listen to prevent it [noise] listen to it I'm not hearing you would do if women\nI found the conversation [laughter]\n\nTalking W Veasey news radio ten thirty [noise]\n\n\nIt is that what we have Josh man I was just about to leave without you [noise]\nHow you doing how you doing rather you know you I like Monday's well actually the thing I like about Mondays is I get to talk to you and listen to your stuff you did all we can cause you do so much cool stuff [laughter]\nThis well this was let's see if you're a Red Sox her patriots fan is is a great weekend to be in town and to be a fan of general um [noise] yeah I just gave Saturday it was a\nAs one would expect quite a exciting or not the greatest finish in the world but they made it for last night so I guess there was a good enough game until the eighth or something it well I tell you what it was it was just a slow that was a really slow baseball get a cold\nNot too bad okay let's back up your weekend I Love talking to my weekends how they're used I think it's important so you get outta here and what time I got out of here about noon well what's that like [laughter]\nLeaving friday at noon yeah uh depends\nOn the traffic depends on the day was a it is friday so I think everybody has that same mindset when they leave ...\nDo you squandered time or you just kind of ... around or do you get right on doing something it's a great question a little bit of poaching is probably ... have you went home yeah and you can just wandering around one around ... ... you know goofing off cleaning stuff up whenever my ...\nOn the Internet organized men are like a a little cleaning hair a little ... and just kind of wandering around yes wasting like two hours just exactly that's that's a good way to start the weekend by wasting two hours and then so what you're looking at two o'clock and you're ... you went to the game on Saturday Saturday So we didn't talk about friday so\n... ... you punched around\nYour friday to be honest I'm trying to remember what it did friday referee there was so much anticipation for Saturday's yeah event and because it's the first game of the series and you're seeing the Astros for the first time with you know it's it was it was good did you stay home\nI think right in a friday I did say hell yeah\nSo what about the big long stretch from two to sleepy tired or sleep well here's the thing we talked about this before sleepy time for us it's kind of random right you you kind of crash wherever you crash so what time is sleepy time ... time on friday was like ten o'clock I feel like reporting to my wife ... so what did you do for that time\nThat I think I did did you worry a little bit of good will of binge watching I think your paperwork meaning\nYou know bills just yes deaf taking care nothing nothing nothing fancy okay you know well one thing I didn't have to do this weekend was I got an email jail and I'm Talking ... jail yup\nNo nothing in nothing else really\nJust it did you lose your wife I or whatever no I get too many messages mice space they said okay your full you got to buy more space acquaint some stuff oh\nYou're kidding yeah not much how much how much will you get well\nPeople's ideal in MP threes and videos a lot and that's the thing I had to go back to school and figuring out how to ... by attachment size and get rid of the big stuff and get rid of this stuff I didn't want without getting rid of the important stuff\nI did find you when you ... cause you shoot a lot of video when you're on your travels yeah do you save all that raw foods or do you try and archive it in or court get rid of it what do you know it's\nKind of saved cause I shoot it on the iPhone and that's why I have the fancy iPhone and I have\nSpace in the sky and I never have to clean it out and it's weird I dread the day when I'm going to have to go through that and it just goes to the cloud yeah I have I paid ten bucks for extra cloud space yep a month yeah uh you know and I guess I could maybe get away without it I don't know I could look into that\nBut it's if you want to save it so you can read purpose it potentially if you need to\nKnow I just don't need to throw it away now and you know maybe\n... percent so it's that George Carlin there's more room for your stuff which is 'cause that's that's a blessing and the curse about closet space or extra large room I could put stuff in a box stick in the corner and then you forget about it right to do\nI Know what am I guess is my guest is being hounded by his wife\nDid you get a bigger house and he doesn't want to you know that won't change life and he knows I'll just get more stuff that's what happens right I feel\nYour space with horse next time you move it's worse and worse and worse because you rediscovered this stuff you didn't clean out the last time\n[noise] [noise] yes and so I was asking folks because of you and your children how because they're so awesome and plus I I was doing the dishes today and it just randomly popped in my head and Josh is kids are awesome I've I resolved to ask folks\nWhat their secret for parenting was what makes good what makes that kids awesome and do you have a handle on what that is\nWow well first of all I'm that you're very kind uh that that makes me very proud as the father um no I you know I I think parenting\nLike a lot of things in life it really is an individual choice there is no there is no there was no exact route or passed at fault part of it is just figuring it out as you go along I'm having done it so you must have\nYeah we have in the pond some rules we would get there were was there was no corporal punishment we we didn't believe in that uh I think I think being consistent with with the boundaries in parameters that you were stabbed as a parent\nAnd those grow shrink and and and then larger over time depending on how old the kids are but that that strong sense of what's right and wrong the importance of looking somebody in the eye and shaking their hand and saying hello the importance of being respectful to people who are older\nNot a difference but I just I don't it's kind of you're passing along what was passed on the audience hello like for example\nBe nice to older people I think from both from the earliest for once they're beginning to express themselves\nOr with physical actions are verbal actions what you did you serve is still that look somebody I'd say ... very nice to meet you or thank you very much the notion of writing\nA thank you know after you get a president or received some nice trip or whatever it might yeah he that's a great thing and we're still as well we don't write many notes and he'll kind of old school values a little bit old school values\nBut also in that sense so that you're appreciating things in the moment it's not oh here's more stuff and I'll do you know stock pilot and think about it later it so that was very nice you know on your way so\nEvery once in awhile the bucks in the buck has to stop and you want him to do something then they won't and you want him to do it and they won't or conversely you don't want to do and they do you have no final like there's no this is\nThis this is as far as you can go I mean like what do you do and you get to the end there's no ... no punishment so what happened to remember in uh uh what was the Silverado Yeah John Cleese plays an English sheriff who's in this town\nAnd he's pursuing these guys and at one point one of them shoots his hat off and it goes today my jurisdiction ends here [laughter] so you can draw lines in the sand but those lines will shift back and forth I don't think there's ever a permanent I mean I I think it depends on each situation and what a parent has to put down for you know I've I Can't deal with this\nAspect yeah have you any more but I got to be some sort of nuclear option well some people get some people blow up and yell at their kids some people try and talk to their kid what do you do I find a happy balance between the two nobody's perfect I looked at their\nTheir conscience situations where like I should have done that differently right and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't I think the most important thing actually to be honest probably the most warnings to have a good system dial up keep the belly up once it gets okay\nYou're awesome uh thanks what's what is what are we looking at it on the news a great day for Red Sox patriots fans both win last night they defeat the cheeks were undefeated coming in stocks are tied with the Astros\nOngoing situation in the ... valley people's electricity is being maxed out because it's cold and using

wanted to see what happens when a manager responds in terms of reviewing so do people review more if they see that the measure responds will do the reviewer less leave higher ratings low ratings and what we find that sort of like good news and bad news if the manager of response for hotel that the measure responded to his views people then review more\nIt's almost like they feel that um you know the manager listening to them um or they feel that they're they have some impact a but what we found out that yeah the the amount of reviews increases but their reviews tend to be I'm a little bit more negative\nSometimes he ... when you see those reviews said the manager will explain that a how they addressed that complaint to or a or a negative review do you think people are maybe just looking for a freebie or something like that or they just want the attention\nI think there's a difference if you're looking for a freebie you would uh directly can contact a manager um I think I don't see we didn't see a lot of this going on um what we found and then we we did some separate checks and and that some experiments\nIs that people genuinely want to have impact so I mean the people who will do we take the time to weigh in and write reviews are people who really wants to impact so it sounds a bit optimistic that I'm an altruistic um but that's what the new ... what we see what we observed\nDo you have a message to manager so when it comes to things like this\nYou don't want to encourage do really extreme and it's sort of outlier reviews about I think responding is a good thing
