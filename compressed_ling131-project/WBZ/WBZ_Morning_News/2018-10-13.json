go see FDR\nAnd Roosevelt must have decided after Portsmouth he was going to drive up to Capitol Bella was beloved a\nOcean side of the state just sort of line and Canada so the only way to get anywhere in Maine was driving up Irwin\nPulse into my family's restaurant so everyone the restaurant went down to see FDR he and his entourage unannounced because they weren't a lot of restaurants
