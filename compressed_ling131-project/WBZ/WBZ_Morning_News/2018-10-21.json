Jesus said I have come not to be served but to serve and so that makes it a very apt title\nFor our leader in the face\nThe dictionary defines a servant is one who exerts him or herself for the benefit of another\nWell without a doubt Jesus certainly fulfills that definition and I say that in the present teeth fulfills that definition even for us in this moment\nJames and John the apostles had miss understood the mission of Jesus as serpent suffering one at that\nAnd they thought that he was about to establish a glorious Newt kingdom and Israel\nAnd they wanted to make sure\nThat when the kingdom came to be that they had a place of honor in it\nThat's what they had in mind when they asked this favor see to it that we sit one that you're right and the other ... little did they realize that Jesus would come into his glory only\nBy his passion\nIn horrible death [noise] little did they know\nWhat Jesus had in store for them if they were\nTo accept the responsibility of really being his followers and\nDisciples little\nDid they know Good Friday came as a terrible shock to James in John\nAs well as too many others\nAnd it was only in the light of the resurrection on that first Easter that they learn the meaning of Jesus words\nWords that he spoke to them and the gospel this morning\nThey realized that as his followers they too had to be serving surface of the servants have gone they had to exert themselves for others even\nTo the point to death James as a matter of fact was beheaded by heritage grip up around the you're forty four first of the apostles to endure monitor them\nJohn was not monitored but he was tortured in exile this you probably know to the island to pat Voss\nWhere then he served his fellow Christians\nUntil he died\n[noise] you know it's one thing to appreciate Jesus as a servant and to be grateful for his generosity on our behalf\nIt's quite another thing to recognize that we too must also be servants after his example that exerting ourselves for others is the only way really to satisfaction and fulfillment in this life\nAs well as a means for attaining everlasting happiness\nLast week we heard Jesus proclaimed that happiness does not come from money\nWill leisure but from a sense of accomplishment\nWell today I think he wants to see our accomplishments in terms of service to others\nJesus is very much interested in having\nThe right attitude\nIn our minds and hearts and all that we do\n[noise] we may suspect that to become a good servant means doing extraordinary favors for others special good deeds that are outside the arena of our everyday occupation\nWell to some extent maybe that suspicion is correct but on the other hand we must first get the Christian attitude about our ordinary activity\nThe second Vatican Council teaches that while providing the substance of life for themselves and their families men and women are performing their activities in a way which appropriately then it benefits society in other words as fathers and mothers\nYou should look not upon the care of your family has some kind of worthless routine or drudgery\nWhatever our duties are\nThey are for us away becoming true certainly\nJesus Christ our Mario Brothers\nMade up of every race we are young and rich men and women\nCenters and things\nAre family is banned the centuries and with God's Grace we started hospitals
