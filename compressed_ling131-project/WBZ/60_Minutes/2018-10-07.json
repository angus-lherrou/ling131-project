for by North Star media group incorporated\nMass General Cancer Center where it's often the small acts of kindness that may seem ordinary that are actually extraordinary and amazing to others a smile a helping hand simply listening sometimes these kinds of things can be just as important as\nDemocratic senator Heidi Heitkamp is close to Republican Collins but far removed from her friends decision\nWhen this nominee was announced I had a completely open mind had a chance to meet him in fact liked him I had a chance to begin to review his judicial record and there was a really nothing at that point that I believed was disqualifying yeah probably yeah that\nIs until I Would say if you're\nLike well two things stand out first off I think that her story with completely believable and I found his performance to be disturbing\nFish is a circus I think you know and you can understand the anger specially if you believe you are wrongfully accused as the questioning went on and really at the point that um he had his interaction with any called the ... I was jaw dropping from me\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened it's just going about yeah blackout I don't know if you\nCould you answer the questions judge it just happened\nIs that your answer done I'm curious if you have\nI have a responsibility not only to find somebody academically and intellectually qualified but qualified by temperament impartiality and buy a you know what we what we see empathy\nWith what degree of certain ... do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted\nOne hundred percent I think when Senator Durbin asked her how certain she was and she looked at him and she said I'm a hundred percent certain I Believe\nThe senators who have decided to vote in favor of judge Kavanaugh's nomination ... but he was wrongfully accused\nEverybody's going to make their own judgment and and I have to tell you my judgment on her experiences based on a lot of experience working with domestic assault victims domestic violence victims did you read the report I did but I didn't find the information they're particularly enlightening\nEven after the FBI has interviewed everyone on Dr Ford has named as president that horrible night that she remembers\nEvery single one of them including her best friend had no recollection of anything like that\nDemocrat Heitkamp and Republican Collins often meet in the middle on common ground they also share of political vulnerability hike camp is a Democrat in conservative North Dakota Collins is a Republican in a state with many independent minded voters\nYour decision is not going to play well back home and my\nDad is likely true I did not\nTry to weigh a political calculus said this decision it's too important for that I just had to do what I think that's right\nA website went up over these last couple of weeks\nCollecting coupons for whoever your opponent may be in twenty twenty and the deal was that if you voted for Kavanaugh\nThan the credit card pledge would be processed if you voted against Kavanaugh they wouldn't process the credit card numbers and something over two million dollars was raise\nThis essay class say quid pro quo as finding are bribery lives they're asking me to perform and it fits all act and if I Do not to what they want\nTo marry and plus dollars is going to go to my own and I think that if our politics has gotten to the point where people are trying to buy votes and by positions and say we are in a very sad place\nColumns doesn't face reelection for two years but Democrat Heitkamp situation is much more perilous she's up for reelection now and in August judge Kavanaugh support in North Dakota was running sixty percent\nAt this moment about four weeks before the election you are running behind your Republican challenger North Dakota ... a political consultant would have told you that voting for Kavanaugh\nWould have been better for you\nYeah I don't think there's any doubt about that I think that the the politically expedient here was a a yes vote often\nBecause this isn't about politics this is about a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court this is about a a a a responsibility that we have as leaders of responsibility that we have\nTo exercise the judgment that we were sent here to exercise I have too much respect for the institution of the Supreme Court and I'm not going to be the person who makes a decision based on whether I get six more years in Washington DC when I make the decision based on what I think about the institution\nThat may make you rare in the Senate in two thousand when I was running for governor I was diagnosed with breast cancer and was serious I you know my doctor afterwards told me you have a twenty percent chance of living ten years that was Eighteen years ago and so I tell young people say you have you have to account you know the bank account\nThat you have a time account what are you going to do with your time do I have work that I Want it can can you to do absolutely do I want to compromise my principles and my conscience for that job you know and do I want to compromise the Supreme Court for that job no\nYou are rare for many reasons but one of the reasons are pro choice Republicans many of your opponents are going to say she's pro choice you use pro women's rights and she just sent a man accused of sexual assault to the Supreme Court of you know stretch\nI Would never vote for someone who had committed sexual assault or who had lied about sexual assault that's not a hard call for me I Would have voted now if I desperately to a judge cab now\nBut camping and hit us that in aisles and the lack of evidence that this happened\nI chatted sick not think that it was fair to ruin the life of this this thing which dads and his band light over allegations that cannot be profiled\nThere are many who believe the judge Kavanaugh will be the votes that results in abortion becoming a week or the United states and I wonder if you're concerned about that\nI could not vote for a judge who had demonstrated hostility to roe the way because it would indicate a lack of for a fact for precedent\nWhy jak Cabot not tell me and suffer Supreme Court nominee that enter bailed out of sex assault me that is that he his press for that and not just as a legal doctrine but it's rooted in our constitution sat\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty\nThe news or forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nThe vote was the closest for the confirmation of the Supreme Court justice in Eighteen eighty one Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in hours later\nThe Senate here's left ribbon bipartisanship\nWhile across the street the Supreme Court's new term will try to reconcile shifted in philosophical balance among the justices with the words carved above the door\nEqual justice under
