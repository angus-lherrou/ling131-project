that you have literally played shows four eighty five thousand people and and that was like almost alarming to ...\nYou know it's more alarming is that it's almost feels normal now to do that because we've done it so many times yeah but in fairness\nWe they didn't all they came to see Metallica yeah that one was about when we were on right before Metallica I don't know that we could have pulled that crowd [laughter]\nOne time but now I'm lost and I don't know\nWhat happened to him\nIt would be\nSo easily now you don't remember the court I just got one quarter wrong but it was about a painful
