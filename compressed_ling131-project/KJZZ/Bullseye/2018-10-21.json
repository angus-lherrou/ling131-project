its history and particularly about the devastating fire that almost demolish the librarian Nineteen eighty six\nThe book is also kind of a pay on to libraries everywhere what they mean to her what

with libraries personally of in your obvious financial relationship\nRight [laughter] one would hope\nUm well I grew up going to the library that was very much a part of my childhood and my parents were great\nLibrary goers they didn't really believe in buying books they I think they felt like why would you buy a book you go to the library and borrow the book and if it's not and you put your name on a whole list and you get it when it's available\nAnd they were born in the depression and I'm sure that's a lot of it which is that buying books seemed like a bit of an indulgence that wasn't necessary [noise]\nI grew up going to the library a couple of times a week with my mom and I found it\nAbsolutely magical it was not like going to a bookstore or a toy store it was partly because there was no money there was no financial relationship and when you're a kid the idea that you can have anything you want is really intoxicating\nAnd a library is more on on a real short list of places that welcome everyone including kids were a hassle right [laughter] well and I do think that\nIn the last Twenty years we've as a society become more and more conscious a kind of ...\nThe idea that you can have anything you want is really intoxicating\nAnd a library is we're all on a real short list of places that welcome everyone including kids were a hassle\nRight [laughter] well and I do think that in the last Twenty years we've as a society become more and more conscious a kind of call it the Starbucks effect we've become conscious of\nHow\nTheir home and there's your workplace and there's kind of a desire for another place somewhere to go somewhere to see other humans and just sort of share the space with them\nIt's I think it's why people go to co working spaces I think it's why people go to public parks even if they've got a backyard there's something\nVery special about being somewhere around other people and you're not there to interact with them you're just sharing space with them\nAnd that's definitely some quality of libraries I mean they're they're closest analog is probably a public park\nYou I've written for the New Yorker for thirty some years and ah and you are a New Yorker for a long time how did your experience of living in Los Angeles\nCompared to your expectations about Los Angeles [noise] I had\nHere a lot over the years before I moved here and ... had been downtown once as far as I knew [noise]\nUm my expectation of Los Angeles was that I Would never spend time downtown and at the time I moved here which is now seven years ago [noise]\nHi I'm Phil Latzman and thanks for listening to cages easiest audio service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all of their accounting each\n... you were part time controller dark all\nI moved here which is now seven years ago [noise] downtown was just on the brink of really changing and revitalizing and re populating\nI never imagined that I Would be doing a book about the library I moved to Los Angeles because my husband was asked to help with the company and that was starting up\nAnd we thought oh that'd be fun and we'll go for a year or get some nice weather and go back to New York at the end of the year\nIn the course of being here I was given a tour of the downtown library and first of all I thought oh my God this building is amazing it's a beautiful building and a very eccentric interesting piece of architecture\nNineteen twenties era but\nInflicted with all of this sort of addiction and Moroccan kind of a aesthetic and it's a really interesting building so I was kind of struck immediately just about what it called building it was and how I had never been downtown to see it\nBut walking through the library and thinking boy this is just an incredible repository of amazing stories I was being told some of the stories of of various city librarians who had run library over the years many of whom were incredibly eccentric\nFascinating figures and I found myself just being drawn and more and more thinking oh my God this is an amazing\nBarry and thinking boy this is just an incredible repository of amazing stories I was being told some of the stories of of various city librarians who had run library over the years many of whom were incredibly eccentric fascinating figures and\nI found myself just being drawn and more and more thinking oh my God this is an amazing place somebody should write about this not thinking that somebody was me [noise] um and right at a moment the person giving me the tour had pulled one of the books off the shelf and took a deep\nWhiff of the book I thought well I guess\nI'm In a new city where people do things like smells books and I I kind of dismissed it\nUntil he said well you can still smell the smoke and some of them and I thought how they used to let people smoke in the library that seem very old\nSort of I I don't want to say the highlight of their career because obviously it wasn't something they were joyful about but it was the most intense experience so their careers\nMore with Susan Orlean after a quick break they never convicted anyone starting the Nineteen eighty six library fire Susan will tell me why when she started her library book she thought she could solve the case it's

his twenties named Harry peak who was\nUm I guess predictably a wannabe actor\nErrand boy I'm you know did odd jobs parked cars that kind of thing um was well what what happened was he had told a number of friends that he had started the fire so very quickly ... ah [noise]\nOnce there was a reward\nAssociated with anyone having providing a tip for solving the fire a one of his friends good to have friends like that came forward and\nUm basically connected the fire department to him and they began following them around and ended up\nI'm interviewing him to figure out whether his boasts of having started the fire we're we're in fact true\nShe was a charming liar\nHe was from every description I had from anybody he was an immensely likeable guy charming and just a crazy favor own would just tip about stupid thing not\nJust the tip you say where where have you been to I was having drinks with share you know he just couldn't tell us straight story and\nHis friends would it were exasperated by him and at the same time also said he was a really good guy would give you the shirt off his back and that was interesting to me they all\nJust tip about stupid thing not just the tip you say where where have you been to I was having drinks with share you know he just couldn't tell us straight story and\nHis friends would it were exasperated by him in at the same time also said he was a really good guy would give you the shirt off his back and that was interesting to me they all use that exact expression he would give you the shirt off his back he was\nThe love and and also drove them crazy\nSo in a way this is what might be called a\nTrue crime narrative I guess\nAnd I wonder if you felt pressured by the fact that you were telling their crime story to have a narrative that resolved comfortably to provide an answer to the question\nI I did I first of all I thought I'm going to solve this which is utterly veins [laughter] I mean that there is no way that a civilian with no access to\nThe evidence and no knowledge of how to investigate and arson would be able to crack the case but that was my first thought is I'm going to solve this [noise] um and\nMaybe if you had to read pad band friends it right and like the original van has come on guys and a big dog right isn't that the the way we do ... but I'm\nI'm fairly comfortable with the idea that I don't have to come to a final conclusion and it may be\nUm and maybe if you had to read pad band friends it right and ... and he has come on guys and a big dog right isn't that the the way we do premise but I'm\nI'm fairly comfortable with\nThe ideas that\nI don't have to come to a final conclusion and it may be\nOut of the reality of so many of the things I write about don't have a tidy conclusion or don't resolve in the way that I might have expected them to resolve in this case I think following the different possible outcomes it's a bit of a choose your own adventure and [noise]\nAnd you come to your own conclusion essentially a because there's no way to reexamine the evidence\nAt this point what I've\nTried to do is lay out all the different paths of thought that could lead you to a conclusion [noise]\nIt may be that when I wrote the orchid Steve and I was determined to see a ghost or good and as time has growing short and I thought oh my God the book has ruined I'm never going to see a ghost or good and I finally had a deadline that I had to make\nAnd I didn't see one\nSuddenly it seemed like well of course I'm not going to see one\nThat's that's the point it's\nDoesn't matter that I'm not going to see it it it would never match the anticipation of seeing it so it was the first experience I had a ... conclusion conclusion and in its own way it felt\nI mean it is the reality it is the fact is without giving\nThat's that's the point it's\nIt doesn't matter that I'm not going to see it it it would never match the anticipation of seeing it so it was the first experience I had a ... conclusion conclusion and\nIn its own way it felt I mean it is the reality it is the fact is without giving anything away it's it's not possible\nTo come to a conclusion I mean my my notion that I Would solve it being something that very quickly I realize that's nuts but it isn't possible to ultimately no what happened and\nI was comfortable finally thinking that's OK I'm giving you the different paths of thought and and um maybe you see the one of them being the persuasive one\nWell Susan Arlene I really loved your book and I always love for having on the show thank you so much for coming over and over time Oh thank you it's a pleasure [noise]\nSusan Orlean her book the library book it's bookstores this week I loved it so much it's one of those books where\nThe

it as a career path\nThat change when his mom literally from her deathbed told him to start singing he moved to New York with his brother and recorded the album water in two thousand and that's the

Vance just a\nYou know black people but you know you can you could say that just by checking out some of the things that he uh you know how forceful was he was he on the front lines of in in in marching\nJest his being there his eloquence his genius ... this is a thing that knew exactly who he was he was the darkness of dark\nHe knew he exactly who he was he knew he was you know there was a perception of the perceived threat and his blackness but he took it and he graced it so beautifully\nAnd even it hit it even affected some of the songs that he chose to same idea of singing love songs to love love songs to humanity\nA universal love\nSmile nature boy pick yourself up this type of song in a way is is uniquely connected to him because their love songs to love and to life\nAnd that's profoundly affected me but in a way it was a thing that he in some in some way had to do because you know\nLove smile nature boy pick yourself up this type of song in a way is is uniquely connected to him because their love songs to love and to life\nAnd that's profoundly affected me but in a way it was a thing that he in some in some way had to do because you know swooning after Nat King Cole was not a popular thing\nFor you know many parents and many people's minds at the time\nYou know in some ways I called him the the original Iraq Obama because he he knew who he was and he knew how he had to uh you know traverse this world and he knew he had to do it with grace\nAnd he did and he still got his message across now I think about you know people think about his his lyrics and it was like oh it's you know he's in the sky and he's he's you know it's just so you know milk toast and sweet but\nThink about a song like pick yourself up and dusted herself off and start all over again think about that song for somebody who had been pushed down who had been mistreated\nWho had been punched kicked or bitten in the civil rights struggle pick yourself up just yourself off start all over again means something totally different to them totally different it means something totally different than my mother\nSmile though you're hard as they can mean something totally different to her\nYou know uh to to the people that are under underneath to the people who have been pushed down many and that sounds mean something totally different it's encouragement is optimism and um\nI've been totally different to them totally different it means something totally different to my mother smile though your heart is they can mean something totally different to her\nYou know a ... to the people that are under underneath to the people who have been pushed down\nMany and that sounds mean something totally different it's encourage them it is optimism\nAnd I'm so when we talked about his contribution to people that are on the underneath you absolutely have to consider these these lyrics that I hear now and that they still four to five people you have to think of that um\nSo he had he had a great great contribution you know first a first black men have his OWN TV show and and uh [noise]\nYou know just the experiment of that [laughter] 'cause it was really something extraordinary for and if you know for an American culture that that wasn't a wasn't so open to that and\nWell let's hear my guess Gregory Porter singing pick yourself up his most recent record is called Nat King Cole\nIt yourself or\nTake a deep breath [noise]\nJust just a start all over again [noise]\nNothing's impossible I have a problem when much on round\nThe auto loan or a man\nI'm Jesse ... listening to balls I my guess is the jazz singer and try to Bakersfield, California Greg reporter I hear you often compared to bill withers you know go where there's you know maybe my favorite ever [laughter]\nThought oh\nI'm Jesse ... listening to balls I my guess is the jazz singer and pride of Bakersfield, California\nGreg reporter I hear you often compared to build weather's you know go where there's you know maybe my favorite ever\n[laughter] you know what I'm saying like it would be careful with those ...
