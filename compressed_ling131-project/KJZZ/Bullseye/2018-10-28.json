on the bright side of life I sort of biography [noise]\nUm when you write a memoir ... one of the things that you have to deal with is the important people in your life who you are I'm remembering after they're passing was added difficult part of writing a book\nWas it was the hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write the story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I Want us to just write a book that I wanted to writes how I wanted to write checks on just let's see what it what happened is why does it go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoided\n... was added difficult part of writing the book\nIt was it was the hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write the story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I Want us to just write a book that I wanted to writes how I wanted to write to us on just let's see what it what happens why does it go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoiding dealing with some people I knew who recently passed and I particularly Robin I hadn't face the fact that I really didn't believe he was dead it totally and I owed it to him to write about him because I known him since Nineteen eighty and we've been very close\nUm to write something about him and says this is science fresh wants to kind of an extraordinary person he was and so that was sort of hard to do\nBut that was the that's the discipline of when you come back to a thing you try and put some shape into its ... knees what's missing ... can you put into the cake you know that make it make it better as a book\nWhen you did that when you're engaged with I mean Robin Williams is one of the people George Harrison is a lot of folks that you write about um Graham Chapman although Chapman has you know you've covered in many more python centric things in the book [noise]\nUm yeah how ... how do you feel differently about they're passing as a you know as a guy in his mid seventies like as a person who has a lot to retrospect about\nYou look around and suddenly all the people I found really funny and really great because I didn't uh gone like Garry Shandling all Carrie Fisher I'm Mike Nichols you know they they you know and that's something that is oh I get it so what wait so the death thing that that doesn't apply then okay\nUm and you know I think the scientists\nA lot to retrospect about\nWhat you look around and suddenly all the people I found really funny and really great for going to dinner or I've gone I Garry Shandling all Carrie Fisher I'm Mike Nichols you know they they you know and that's something that is oh I get it so what wait so the death thing that that does apply then okay\nUm and you know I think the fact is that you just it'd be ... to ... put things into perspective and then you know I like to encourage younger people um and just you know to to write about people I Want you to write about titles lights um\nWhat's that looking straight she broke eminent Victorians these an ambulance Elizabethan but uh I I I liked the idea of writing about ... says people who who you knew or have some insight into I think that's that's interesting for people and it's also interesting for me to write about\nIf the fiftieth anniversary of python coming up and you've done what you say will be your last chose [laughter]\nUm and you know you just throw your memoir like you're in you're in looking back mode rights do you still look forward to to still make the kinds of plants that you made ten years ago or Twenty years ago or fifty years ago\nNo I mainly ones that sort of read the books and [laughter] they're like a child you know [laughter] but\nUm we can't do it again because sadly Terry Jones is not able to do it again and then so that's just a few of us left able and it wouldn't be the same I think we did a big show in a big fat well\nWe have a little we may have some surprises up our sleeves but um it will be certainly not us particularly performing it will be encouraging other things to take place I think that's the best I can express it um [noise]\nAgain because

tell so [laughter] and and the ... you know there's actually a a a ... from ... the last patrol fest sunk would not be one to and I did I I Do crazy it's also in that\nEven though it's not even be on the records I think from playing sauce and that record\nWhen you were a teenager playing and metal bands did you do that thing that teenagers who plan metal bands do which is like sit in your room and banging out rats faster and faster until you can totally shred like Davis taint\nTotally although I was trying to shreds like um [noise] I was trying to spread like my Friedman really Colgan and

... the thing is I've had the original version of that song I had for so\nLong like crazy like first blood orange album bears do other than nine twenty ten [laughter]\nSo what's it like when you are making one of those records I ... and how is it different from when you're making your own records are usually going in with demos or\nI'm not ... it varies it's all it's a kind of in my thing was collaborator people is out there in any way they want because I'm\nGiving myself as a service to them and so if they want me to just sit and come up with many of these wild as a producer I'll do that if they want me to produce track I'll do that you know\nIt's whatever they want to ride in the room together just me and them create something\nThen I'll do that I'm very like if I've given myself to that person and in that environment than I'm you know kind of there's an just will try and\nOf these wild as a producer I'll do that they want me to produce truck I'll do that you know it's whatever they want to ride in the room together just me and them create something then I'll do that I'm very like if I've given myself\nTo that person and in that environment than I'm you know kind of theirs and just we'll try and be respectful and make the best thing you know so it was a completely different mindset\nIt's to me just like walking around fit in ideas and the book it's like a different goal yeah different goal post you know\nYou have daddy on this new record mhm I have a friend who thinks that did he may have magic powers [laughter]\nProbably uh my friend comedian Chris ... how did he on his show a few times are both is is live show in his television show and at one point I did he's assistant told him that he he or she believe that did he had magic powers and then did he did something magical\nUm and it really blew Christmas [laughter]\nWell [laughter] but like I think of all the people in the ... of all the people in the contemporary music industry or maybe the one who seems the least like a real human being to me is steady\nOr like he seems like some like a mythical like a story about a record producer\nRight so how did you get daddy on your record like to do like meet him at the grocery store or like get is number on somebody did you imagine that he would would you do have light duty part and you're like I got to get Diddy for this\nRight so how did you get daddy on
