just launched another new show on HBO it's called divorced its second season wrapped up earlier this year\nThey're working on a third one now it's a dramatic that talks about the end of a marriage and the wreckage and birth that you find in its wake Sarah place Francis a corporate recruiter who's been with her husband Robert played by Thomas Hayden church for Seventeen years church and Parker\nDon't really want to call it chemistry since they're splitting up on the show but there was something compelling by the way they interact on screen the series takes on topics like commitment fidelity even finances in a very Frank and sometimes very funny way\nHere's a little bit from the first season of divorce and this scene from the show's pilot Francis gives her husband the news\nYou spent last Christmas fishing in Alaska\nKnown to hang on a second that's the only time of the year that the Chinook salmon run in those numbers and you said you didn't mind\nI didn't mind it was the

say\nThank you thank you so much for having me I Want to ask you something I'm a serious to begin with which is I had this experience or a couple of years ago where a a pair of good friends of myself and my wife\nA split up they were married and um my my own parents were divorced when I was very young and I you know I always thought oh that was for the better I mean they didn't get along um but when these friends of mine were splitting up\nUh I sort of freaked out\n[laughter] I was really legitimately freaking out about it these people live three thousand miles from me [laughter] that guy who I care about the very much but they I see them once a year [laughter] right\nAnd a eight or it occurred to me like how intense I just I guess I just never acts I just walled off that part of my ... my life experience mhm and the wall\nWe've freaking out about it people lived three thousand miles from me [laughter]\nI care about the very much but they see them once a year [laughter] right\nAnd uh it ... it occurred to me like how intense I just I guess I just never acts are just walled off that part of my ... my life experience mhm and the wall just crumbled all in one go [laughter] mhm\nUm and I wonder what it's like for you to live with the way that you live with this subject when you're making a TV show live with divorce you know every day when you go to the office\n[laughter] um the experiences I'm not I'm not a personal exploration for me you know in terms of trying to sort out my own home life but rather\nI guess in some ways what you've described as witnessing your friends marriage fell apart you know for me\nIt's a fascinating way to spend a lot of hours because\nI I guess you know the reason that I was interested in it initially in developing the show was because I I I like yourself I was watching friends marriage a fall apart I was witnessing friends um contemplate affairs\nFriends have affairs marriage survives affairs marriage be better for having ... having one party I have an affair you know I um people contemplating divorced not divorce and all those things that surround\nUm surround you when you reach a certain point in your life and people have been in committed relationships meaningful\nSubstantive relationships and I liked very much exploring it it's the exact way I wanted to do it it's the tone that I was hoping for\nAn affair you know I um people contemplating divorced not divorce and all those things that surround um surround you when you reach a certain point in your life and people have been in committed relationships meaningful\nSubstantive relationships and I liked very much exploring it it's the exact way I wanted to do it it's the tone that I was hoping for because it's for some it's devastating for others it's I'm an opportunity to sort of um\nMake alliances um and I think it's really complex and I think people's reactions to divorced when it's not their own or really\nOften surprising to themselves\nDoes it does it freak you out or member of the ways when you spend time with it in your heart do you do you feel for John and I don't mean like in the sense liquor does it make you feel like are you and your husband are going to get divorced\nUm what like it's like an existential dread for [laughter]\n[noise] I think I think it doesn't freak me out sometimes it makes me very sad um and I'm I'm I I don't know I'm not I'm not freaked out by it because it's\nAn artistic an academic exercise in some ways and for me I guess I've been an actor for so long that I\nUm I have found a way to compartmentalize the work um I also come home to three children in a ... active household and chaos and um I don't I'm not at liberty to let it um\nPenetrate really beyond the threshold in some way of my own home um but I Love the story I\nI've been an actor for so long that I\nUm I have found a way to compartmentalize the work um I also come home to three children and that the active household and chaos and um I don't I'm not at liberty to let it um\nPenetrate really beyond the threshold in some way of my own home um but I Love the story I like pushing on the bruise I I've always been that way and um\nI I'm much more interested in the potential to be freaked out than not I want to\nPlay a pushing on the bruise scene from divorce\nSo ah your character whose name is Francis is a head

[laughter]\nI'm not only did I have a relationship but with his work but before I met him\nUm I when I met him I realized wow I've paid for all your movies [laughter] meaning as an audience I couldn't say that about a lot I could say about Woody Allen's movies from the time I was young child be always went to see Woody Allen movies [noise]\nUm and when I was in Utah shooting footloose that summer I think Matthew at maybe two movies out and I didn't have a car\nBut all my days off I Would go to the movies one or two of which were Matthew Broderick movies so yeah I was very familiar with him I as a as a performer as an actor\nI look I'm a ... I think that um\nAny relationship is it including a relationship between two very famous people as the two of you are a is about like just regular people you know like I've done this job long enough to know that what everybody is a person you know find a point on it but what people are you know human beings\nAre but at the same time I do like the idea that there was some part of you like the first time you and your husband made out or whatever where you are less just making out with Matthew Broderick\n... of course yeah I'm never shared that the things you are you there was so pro being [noise] um yeah I mean I I ... I thought he was I mean there was a reason I kept paying to see him um yeah so when we started dating um we met\nThrough um friends in the theater he was um brothers and Matthew and not the best friend found\nI'm never shared that the things you are you there was so pro being um yeah I mean I I ...

[laughter]\nI ... I ... I don't know a whole conversation wheelchair and Oregon on the shoulder in London a couple of months ago a tree and I had an extensive conversation about Iraq stage I Am ready to make out with him\n[laughter] like ah I think you look so heads of with a moustache me too I mean it's so great and it's so and it is also a little bit is both incredibly wide dashing and handsome and a little ridiculous\nWilliam and Mary perfect way if it is that really helps define that character who has those qualities\nAt talk totally absolutely and I will say one other thing which fits into this idea of when we were in ... for the show and in fact earlier than that I started thinking about what I Hope this show would look like\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... audio service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in nonprofit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part time controller dot com\nAnd in fact earlier than that I started thinking about what I Hope that this show would look like cinematic ally and and what I wanted the music to look like and the costumes and seventies cinema played was the central ... inspiration\nFor me I mean that's what I kept circulate around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and um you know all the great movies in the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play really important role um but I imagine that that\nMusic was the music as separate young people they fell in love\nTo you know a first kiss um you know skipping school all these things that were um narrated by seventies music and um you know Albert will skiing all the great costume designers and and so this moustache\nWas ... it did so beautifully into those ideas and just glimpses of things that show is not a period piece um but it is we help tell it with music from the seventies and even there are composer I really wanted him to find ways of I'm using the flute\nUm because I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter]\nI Love the sound and it's so evocative and anybody of a certain age group or who's interested in music would have a reaction not just to the obviously to the source music but to the composed music as well so the moustache\nWas this gift because it was\nBecause I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter]\nI Love the sound in it so if I could have been anybody of a certain age group or who is interested in music would have a reaction not just to that obviously to the source music but to compose music as well so the moustache\nWas this gift because it was it so beautifully fit into these ideas\nWell Sarah Jessica Parker uh I'm I'm Out of time with you but I'm so grateful that ah you came in to talk to us uh I I really appreciate you taking the time\nOh it's been such a treat and you just did not let me down at all and you asked\nSuch good smart interesting questions and it's been a real privilege to have time with usa thank you so much [noise]\nSarah Jessica Parker you can currently watched the first two seasons of

gathered Chris was of course the host of the legendary Chris gathered show\nIt aired first on New York city public access television then later on the network fusion you might have also seen him on broad city or you don't think twice they were big league improv movie\nChris is also a stand up and when we talk you're going to really interesting special it's called career suicide it's kind of a one man show gathered produced it with John Apatow\nTo genuinely moving special got their talks very specifically about alcoholism about depression and even death but he does it in ways that are totally human very identifiable very funny of course has a new book coming out it's called lose well and it's\nAnd when we talk you've done a really interesting special it's called career suicide it's kind of a one man show gathered produced it would Judd Apatow\nTo genuinely moving special get their talks very specifically about alcoholism about depression even death but he does it in ways that are too human very identifiable very funny\nOf course has a new book coming out it's called lose well\nAnd it's sort of a self help book he talks about the lessons that he's learned in life shortcomings and successes in show business stories of family and friends and there's even a section on his high school band\nThe lesson if you really want to be good at anything you're going to fail and if you want to do the right way to fail Chris gathered has some advice anyway let's take a listen to a little bit from the one man show here she's talking about his early days in show business running from audition to audition to get bit parts in commercials [noise]\nGet accurate I start getting acting work I'm getting mostly commercials mostly commercial if you search my name I Need you to this day you go deep into the searching all you can still find it very annoying commercials for H R Block where I where later [noise]\nI once audition price subway sandwich commercial to play the role of men who is on attractive to women [noise]\nThat was a character named ...\nI couldn't even call them dog or something like [noise]\nI didn't book that part I'm assuming because [noise]\nChris gathered walking back to bull's eye it's good to see a great to see you too so your new special or one man show or whatever you want to call it was called career suicide it's largely about your mental health do you\n[noise] I didn't vote that part I'm assuming because [noise]\nChris gathered walking back to bull's eye it's good to see a great to see you too\nSo your new special or one man show or whatever you want to call it was called career suicide it's largely about your mental health do you feel exhausted by talking about\nIt you know [laughter] you know what I mean one hundred percent yeah one of the great things about the special coming out is that maybe I could talk about I can stop [laughter] everything I have to say about it is in that special and when I get asked about it I can just\nTell people you know find it out all your uh HBO driven streaming platform is from ... because that's really what I have to say about it um 'cause it has been many years of talking about it in some form or another and definitely it's exhausting and doing the show more exhausting than I thought for sure\nHe feels like part of what you're doing in the special and also in your memoir which was the last time you're on the show I think is in writing about it I mean performing about it you are talking yourself into engaging with it fully\nHumidity transforming America's communities to the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more at Americans for the arts dot org this is NPR [noise]\nListening to ... I'm Jesse for my guest Chris ... is a comedian and the star of the one man show career suicide which is washable now on HBO he's also the author of the new book lose well which hits book stores October sixteenth we talked last year\nWhat are the things you talked about in your special show\nFor suicide is the extent to which you had linked to your emotional health to\nYour career this presumption that if your career was successful that you would be ... healthy because of that yeah um two part question do you feel differently about that now are you able to feel differently about that the second part is do you think you would feel comfortable\n[noise] for suicide is the extent to which you had linked to your emotional health to\nYour career this presumption that if your career was successful that you would be emotionally healthy because of that yeah um\nTwo part question do you feel differently about that now are you able to feel differently about that the second part is do you think you would feel comfortable doing work in your career that was good work but not capital G. capital W good works you know what I mean like just if you were like\nIf you got cast on\nAs a second guy in a funny sitcom and you were doing a good job of that yeah and the sitcom was evil but neither was it a place for teenagers to come out right\nRight it was a it wasn't A Guided by this sense of urgency or a\nChip on his shoulder that my work clearly has now at like ... I'm definitely a workaholic its problems it's probably like one of the biggest things are still wrap my head around is that I get caught too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go it tomorrow which could\nGetting better about that you know have a little bit for stability and I've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like a you know like if if I can get one of those big jobs everybody have to notice it and\nI have to admit that I was right going for this and so I have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of ... cop to the fact that like\nThat it's there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants to witness\nThey'll have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of ... cop to the fact that like\nThat it's there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants witnessed that ask at New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member Knesset now talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on I'm going to get with my next gig far might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy\nYou're in the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause you've proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do because getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems\nAs far as I could I you know could I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square the some of the er standard you could say some of the stuff I've done I don't know like\nI mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest Joe generate shows more funding they said that Joe than there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of him is about some other yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride one of my favorite shows of all time course\nIt doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove something [laughter] you know have their mission statement of trying to like break the system and he came back to I feel like I probably could I imagine you know but I I think hard about it because there's all there's a part of me that's also like if something like that would have happened like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that\nMuch more than being in front of it is about some other yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride one of my favorite shows of all time course but it doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove something [laughter] you know have their mission statement of trying to like break the system and he came back to\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know but I I think hard about it because there's all there's a part of me that's also like if something like that would have happened like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know nobody's doubting by integrity or my indie credibility at this point like I think anyone who knows my work would say\nThat guy spent years bending over backwards to try to do this thing and that time he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had visibly quit and other people's fans rather be working on the show would convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I couldn't move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel a lot of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up accomplishing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work\nAnd I'm not quite there yet but I Would love to see because I feel like one of the things that I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago when nobody\nWas particularly interested in I had to just like kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself I'd love to find the comedians who are in that spot and help them not to have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen\nSo that's another thing is like maybe if I was to get one of those bigger jobs that could give me that credibility and that could bring some other stuff into the world's but who knows I don't know I'll sell out some day everybody does right\nBoyce providing assessing the or people who have walked their own path and they find this and it's like oh this is a community of people over there I'll bet it's a beautiful thing I'm very very proud of it those are my people but it's funny they are so why is that like I get the sense\nOnline sometimes I'm really in tune with these people this past week I was in a fight with my own fan club I might they banned they shut they stopped comments on my post and the Facebook group that's my fan club the get the ads and I was honestly mad about it and they were like we don't care where shutting down like I have this contentious relationship\nAnd I get this that sometimes that like\nThey are such underground people and so passionate about the values of that\nThat me being in ... his movie is a little bit of a sellout [laughter] beautiful anonymous pod a pod cast they're like you're getting a little too mainstream for us buddy and there's almost like a counter cultural element to the gathered show where I have to grow and I have to evolve\nAnd I'm In a ... it's a very fascinating thing to realize I don't know if they want me to and that's a very odd feeling very odd feeling I can steal them being happy for me but I can also feel to feel a lot of my older school fans feeling like man like he's really\nHe's really growing up and moving on and I don't know exactly how to handle that 'cause I feel like that's what I've always been working towards is trying to get a better head on my shoulders it's weird I don't know how to go\nI'm heading you know especially thinking about H. B. O. like that's a more to the bigger platform than I've ever had your ... name before you're yeah so the top of your credit pretty fancy stuff how much longer can I claimed to be this rebel try to uh throw rocks from the outside the house you know\nI don't know how much longer people are going to buy that\nWe're I don't know how to go I'm heading you know especially thinking about H. B. O. like that's a more a bigger platform than I've ever had your ... name before you're yeah sleepover your credit pretty fancy stuff how much longer can I claim to be this rebel try to ah\nThrow rocks from outside the house you know\nI don't know how much longer people are going to buy that\nBut I don't really know what else I Am are you worried that you're not going to get that that's a night show and you're going to have to move to CBS andme enlarge the ban oh my\nGod that was a little bigger theatre [laughter] follow that man's life I Would be\nVery often I don't know I just read a biography of Batman yeah his wife sound horrible ... I can only talk about what I what I witnessed as a consumer of pop culture yeah they're ready to the junior senator yeah most brilliant out of Fox gene is\nA [laughter] ... has been thrilled about no as far as the things he read about the actual um loneliness that doesn't seem great\nBut I I think a lot of that if he would be proud of the crews gathered show that's like a major concern\nOf mine is like if footage of this ever went across David Letterman's desk would he be sites because in my mind a lot of what's behind it is\nNot talking bad about anybody but late night just used to be a lot weirder I think it just used to be weirder he was weird cone instills weird even Carson had a lot of weird stuff on there\nUsed to be this element to it where it would get a little chaotic unpredictable and now in my opinion seems much more controlled and that's okay but I Want my show it to be an hour of just that\nWhere it would get a little chaotic unpredictable and now in my opinion it seems much more controlled and that's okay but I Want my show it to be an hour of just that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bullseye", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "14"}
