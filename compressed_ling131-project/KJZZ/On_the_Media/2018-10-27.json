immediately retreated to blaming the biggest culprits\nWhat is the first statement the president makes about this today is to attack the media you know he says a very big part of the anger we see today and our society is caused by the purposely false inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news\nHas gotten so bad and hateful that this is beyond description

left\nNotably and an explanation that surprised absolutely no one the conspiracy crowd from Rush Limbaugh too and culture to gateway punted to Lou Dobbs blamed Democrats for a false flag operation supposedly aimed at discredited in the right and the advance of the mid term elections\nYou know the week before the election Trump is certainly trying to use the caravan to\nRepublican advantage although that's a sort of double edged sword for him because you might make an already enthused democratic\nElectorate more enthusiastic by guess baiting them on that issue and Democrats we now have gotten much more liberal on immigration so I guess the short answer is we just don't know how the electorate is reacting to those things\nSo I just one final question does any of this matter or there's still many mine's not made up and of those mine's not made up or they're going to go to the polls in the first place do we have any idea of what would happen if the election were today [noise]\nWell I Would say even in the incredibly part of the year that is twenty Eighteen yes there are still many people whose minds are not made up there are moderate voters who are perhaps\nJust

to ongoing crisis in Honduras Sarah welcome to one of the media thank you for having\nNot until the last couple of days we're speaking on Thursday Afternoon it was kind of mysterious how this\nDrug in a population of truckers would so quickly coalesce but we now know more and it begins I guess with a guy named ... tastes a leftist former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell see I think that our till I started in the second stage is that according to have our tell though and I have not been able to confirm that there were other people with much smaller care that he saw information about it on Facebook and decided to get in touch with those organizers he\nHas always had an experience and facilitate ... immigration um\nAnd so he got in touch with them verified it and then he shared the post on Facebook according to tell her what happened was there isn't any two hundred three hundred people and then there's this news report on hunters as most watch cable news network called eight feet\nSuing coming on dog sees when I got to be identified him as a leader them up by the goal of Wednesday's and then when I look\nIn and they are clearly said that he would be paying for food and other causes are people\nThat are not going to me that you know the guy so I guess every I and I want but I don't know how to do that and he said\nHe got tons and tons and tons of cause but you know\nComing up dog we will see when I got to be identified him as a reader them up by the solar Wednesday and then when I look up to nearly said that he would be paying for food and other costs are people\nThat are a lot for me that you know the guy so I guess every I and I want but on the line\nAnd he said he got tons and tons and tons of cause\nBut you know I don't think that's sort of the explanation I think it helped start things and get them going but then all of the other factor for why people like ... ... has about in the way that it has and that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an extraordinary amount of people\nBut he definitely credits that positive news or part with the initial explosion\nOn the report from HGH here is what ... told you and I'm I'm reading from your story in Honduras the government wants to minimize what people are leaving they know\nThey're going to leave and they want to say that they're doing so because of lives and the opposition not the conditions that day that is the government created\nThis is in line with what the United States is saying that there are false promises being made and this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there is financing when people really just need to get out\nThere is this right wing media me it's actually video of carbon members\nBeing paid cash money\nAs the story is told that it's you know George Soros\nMoney or Democratic Party money bribing people had northward to invade our boys\nWant caravans they liked the caravans a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan but that has been debunked tested not\nYeah absolutely they spend a lot\nAs the story is told that it's you know George Soros money or Democratic Party money bribing people to head north were to invade or\nBrad wants caravans they liked the caravans are lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan but that has been debunked tested not\nYeah absolutely there's been multiple fact checked on it first day on a busy owned by the New York times like there's absolutely nothing to back up that George tourists just paying anyone on the care that\nI Believe that it was local businessmen and it was a very very small amount of money that was passed yet to that and that's really not unusual considering the local support that we're seeing for migrants here in Mexico and the town once people get there\nAnd then along the way they're supervised out water than at a close ally not one for me yesterday and then it how it and I got settled people came out and we're giving us toys underwear all these sorts of different necessities the really seeing a groundswell of local support for this care to\nKnow what's interesting about that Trump is that its origins seemed to be the hunter and basket or to the United states\nWho sent the video footage to a Republican congressman who immediately tweeted it out in their ... called fire so this is not only mid term politics playing out\nIts Honduran domestic politics why would it be in the Honduran government's interest to a plant that false explanation\nActually I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period by the state affairs the closest thing to the ambassador to the United states has around Hunter S\nThe term politics playing out its Honduran domestic politics why would it be in the Honduran government's interest to a plan that false explanations\nThe explanation I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period and by the charge eight affairs\nThe closest thing to the ... the the United States has around Hungarians is that this is funded by the opposition up hunter and that is sort of a political game that people within the country are playing\nThat sort of more than a line that I've been seeing raised\nIn Honduras which makes sense the country is extremely polarized and then they just had a political crisis last year where there was a razor thin election and the machines counting the votes shut down and when they came back on\nThe lead of the opponents slowly starting to slip away and the current President Juan Orlando Hernandez who had been the incumbent one power and so critics allege he he stole the election and it sort of through the country into unrest thirty people died in that shuffle mostly killed by security forces\nTo the country is kind of grown and polarization since so you know this sort of seems that narrative uh with the president that's frankly facing a quarter legitimacy crisis\nMhm\n\n\nComing up homeopathic politics battling attack ads with doses of the ads themselves [noise] this is on the media\nThe media is supporting my progressive insurance within a near price

yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegally protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle with the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWhich is not to use a classroom dreaming\nTo the second one and can\nFans gender was not illegal a protected class the messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWent in math class in the mean\nHe's running can enter a woman cannot\nThat in downtown privacy and the man\nYou can find [noise]\nIt's almost comical a anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me up at the the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trends went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trends related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is the canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nWere able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way for a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having\nIt's where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so I think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if\nThey're approached in such a way from a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other ... groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys\nThree days three weeks six weeks and three months later\nIs that when we compare the group that we had the conversation with at the door versus the group we could have that did not\nThat treatment group is significantly\nMore accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those a trance phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner although we do find the ad has some immediate effect\nThis and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing one\nThing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads it'd be affected the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effects we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive\nMore over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy on the matter of campaign theory\nWe're actually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine move from putting leeches on people and telling the anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you describe too but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of volunteers you have to fan out in the community which is why the campaign industrial complex is built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies whole truth\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of volunteers you have to fan out in the community which is why the campaign industrial complex is built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies\nHold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign and twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others\nWho have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so from my perspective if campaigns don't try and really\nThink about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy that normative leap you might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team\nBut you need is a candidate or a cause that many kinds of engaged individuals want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nWouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from\nThat's the truth is voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical floating on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election results that's kind of a trap that that research on campaigns and elections and campaigns and told me has been for a hundred years\nWe really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign if they had done something else which of course we can't do because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries is that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and you know reorientate other activities around it within the next year on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that\nIs very persuasive and rigorous and the prejudice reduction advocates will be interested in applying in their work\nThere but thank you so much sure thank you David Brock man it's a political scientist at the graduate business school of Stanford University math Collette has been reporting on the question
