atmosphere every year\nAnd that some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things more psi phi end of things where you've got these machines that looked like washing machines with fans in the ... of the year they can do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a

remove ... why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmental is really worried about because if people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the track they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat to keep driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is common

lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report that's come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands near the sea if you can protect those there in ... source of our sing for common they soak up more common than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton per common and that is really really cheap the bigger problem of course a lot of times we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the games are making so the big tech not really happening a lot of smaller think is happening and it's cheap and not just reporters things when you do more but how\nDo you incentivize countries such as China countries such as India which would be an industry and I think very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture yeah\nBoth China and India are taking a lot of these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that are also on the sea building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise] how this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief among the richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon\nSuch as India which would be an industry and I
