operations in Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they found debris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point\nThey still haven't found any survivors they both are sent helicopters to scour the seas in the nearby areas to look for any people\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash or the rescue officials or any officials in Indonesia reading anything into this as to the cause of the crash well it's kind of what they do say that they can confound the cause of\nThe crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crashed some thirty to forty meat is into the sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that he's analyzed so no official confirmation of this analysis I I\nHave to add but what he's been able to analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed\nWith the washer it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane but he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of level balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon enough to take off that's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though\nDid that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of level balance from the point that it took off now those reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon enough to take off\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though\nIs that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea what do we know about line air and there are safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of ally in air flight\nMr Wilson are went around fifty five percent of the voting

someone they always held strong view sometimes controversial view\nAnd he had his a group of loyal voters that or only be enough to elect him congressmen\nAnd doing Thirty years he remains like this\nTo the point that when we had\nThis car washer ... basically swept away a great part of the political establishment he was one of the most vocal voices against the workers' party\nThat was touched by corruption giving him an edge and this aura of someone that could represent a something new\nSo do you think the vote for him was actually a vote for Mr both on our or it was a vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidates deck and bought it the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns\nSo do you think the vote for him was actually a vote for Mr both an hour or it was a vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... for NATO but above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepped in body the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the algae V. T. Q. community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going to mean with all of these comments and concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these were appalling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he would reach where he did a I Believe that the Brazilian institutions and the president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible\nI Believe that hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strengths of their president legislative and judiciary system [noise]\nNow those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that a single really wanted better economy for Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nHe gained a lot of strength and supports particularly with the president market when he chose total kid

of finance oh look at it as an economist that is very respected in Brazil and he's someone who has very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring this trends and also twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that was always a parliamentary system disguised as presidential new system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America so the key decisions or they go through the parliament so the key aspects to observe his relationship between the executive between both ... and his coalition base\nThe indicators that these relationship gives will give us a da da Da Nang six months for one year will be quote\nA if his relationship starts to tremble a little bit
