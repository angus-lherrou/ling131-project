should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models with suggesting we think there's something about the comma\nLet me issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event in debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already ...\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat war is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which used as a great to likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously warm Atlantic\nAnd so we have a storm that is in the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics or intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously won't Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that's that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer areas and cooler areas but basically were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast initialized ... so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as atmosphere temperature changes that have a choice during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that the climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform tests\nParticularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that's a associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and for that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in this set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially dying then rapid change\nCan suddenly create a much larger region the warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into major hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could

people will ever become a member ever the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely slim but those people who reads forensic novel are probably more forensic clear where than any any part of the public has ever been before\nAnd they can quickly smell like something that doesn't sign right so what I have is a huge amounts of respect for the crime writers who actually go and research what is it really like so that what they're doing is they're respecting their readers to saying this is reality I Know it's just made the salt\nThis is actually how it would be no respect for that\nYou've written a book which is full of extraordinary stories and you described so many countless experiences you've had weird death\nBut what you do you do and I don't know whether you feel like

something happens then something changed I was there I held his hands when he took his last breath\nIn life and I felt there was nothing more than I could have done from as adults and that it was the most privileged place that I could ever have been and it was such a gentle process for him that he decided he had enough he stopped drinking he stopped eating he turned his face to the wall and he decided he was going to die\nAnd when he took that that last breath and and the rifle that you hear when they talk about the death rental is pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes

insofar as it's driven by Mr solving is determined to take on Europe will be seen to take on your\nAnd that means a major bust up over this budget\nBut do you think that there's a lot of posturing hair that in the end they'll just have a line that they'll have to do that I Know who could date really take this to the brain can ... down to where it really affects the markets that really affects a

room to back down there for this I added to that you have to include the with the fact that\nThere is now there's competition within the government between the lake are now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself as a dominant force and so\nI I can see this becoming a sort of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take 'em Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism was one phrase used um

sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and at the wildly unrealistic growth expectations in those and say this is not a government we can do business
