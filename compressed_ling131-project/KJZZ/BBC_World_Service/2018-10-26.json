rest of the world\nA and he said to to do a about a a chief executive willing to bad mouth the business model of that primary competitor so there are tensions here despite the fact that will technology companies in America seems to be\nSeeing which way the wind is blowing and are accepting it\nYet or vote even though the wind is blowing in a particular direction the White House is not going to be a massive fan I'm guessing of the kind of regulation that Tim Cook has been cooling for\nWell interesting the or the or the the Trump Administration was pretty hostile to the whole idea of

today or you can't really say with a great deal of confidence that isn't a dead cat bounce particular given lousy uh this month has been but I think one of the thing that's\nBothering the market is is the first quarter in at least three quarters where\nEarnings have not been a little better than expected and people are expecting good earnings and we are getting good earnings but there's no upside big upside surprises and where there are the Sox are doing All right but\nThe market once again it's been priced to perfection in the sense that they expect earnings to continue to increase it you

said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote\nFills that I had these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban\nJust uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one can formation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report

I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process Africans do own and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor its success it's not that we we want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in

clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell well the Taliban contend elections there
