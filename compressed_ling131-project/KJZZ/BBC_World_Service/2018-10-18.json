a store whether it's a government run store or a government sanctioned store and you'll still be able to order online\nYou say it's a bit of a hodgepodge at the moment and the government has left itself into some criticism that they hadn't they know very rough hasn't it\nI mean this is really the result of a an election promise being fulfilled a you know the liberal government was elected in twenty Fifteen there were the only a major party to come out and say that they would fully legalize cannabis others had been saying that they would decriminalize it but this full legalization\nA and it has been three years and they're still a lot of questions and part of that is because it has been technically illegal to sell candidates for so long that there's still a lot of unknowns about it you know the the young brain according to pediatric psychiatrists still continues to develop\nInto the early twenties so that's a problem\nAnd also a big criticism has also been surrounding how are police going to monitor drivers for cannabis consumption\nUm there is no clear cut and dry test that can be administered yesterday we heard the\nPremier of Ontario criticizing the prime minister for for rushing this through because they don't have an effective means for monitoring this and of course there's also the black market\nSo yeah the government says this is a five billion dollar industry at the moment that it wants to bringing to the main market but how that compete with the black market if people can still get it that cheap all almost conveniently\nThat's the problem and that's that's really what uh they've been up against a I mean they are on the one hand the government sanctioned\nThey don't have an effective means for monitoring us and of course there's also the black market\nSo yeah the government says this is a five billion dollar industry at the moment that it wants to bring into the main market but how that compete with the black market if people can still get it that cheap all almost conveniently\nYeah that's the problem and that's that's really what uh they've been up against a I mean they on the one hand if the government sanctioned candidates they want to make it convenient an easy but not too easy they don't they don't want to attract new users I mean that's one of the goals but yeah it is going to be difficult\nBut one economic aspect that each saw to play a role is tourism people will come to Canada now to accept this kind of went and I\nYeah indeed and that's how it's different from the only other country that has legalized in Uruguay it's sold through pharmacies and you have to be a citizen or a resident of Uruguay it's not\nThey don't want to become a tourism destination here it's a different story I mean anyone who has id to show that they are of of the legal age can can walk into a store and buy candidates a city's like Vancouver for example on the west coast has always been known as ... actually the nickname was little advanced or damn\nBecause uh there was just sort of a high tolerance for these candidates cafes so\nMean to some extent in major cities they've already been there but you know at least now uh you know a tourist can come and feel some satisfaction that what they're doing is perfectly legal I I have heard um some concern from people in Halifax for example in the east coast which is not too far from the U.S\nThere is this fear that you know these cruise ships that come in from the states and people load off may just why suddenly all rushed to the candidate store just to give it a try so yeah of

and take control of the house of representatives others ... social my colleague Mike Johnson asked our regular pundit the economist when ... when he was expecting to happen I think\nThe reasonable thing to expect is that the Democrats will take the house of representatives and the Republicans will retain control of the Senate\nIn the house of the um [noise] they have to get flip as they call it here twenty four seats in order to get control of the house and twenty five of the contests are in constituencies that Clinton one very handily\nSo they should be able to do it especially since they

over did their opposition to justice Kavanaugh\nAnd that turned off a an awful lot of people if you want to count on anything Democrats in the house with all of that's going to mean for policy Republicans retaining the Senate\nWhat about this issue of interest rates on Tuesday President Trump went into battle again against the u._s. central bank and its moves to increase the cost of borrowing in an interview he said to my biggest threat is the federal or the Federal Reserve you worry you think that more expensive blurring could damage growth\nNo I ah I I think he's genuinely worried remember he's a real estate developer real estate developers are always heavily in debt and they love low interest rates remember to than in the campaign he campaigned against Janet Yellen for keeping interest rates to low and making Obama look good\nSo it depends really where he stands depends where he says he has a visceral feeling that high interest rates are a bad thing or that they slow economic growth and he's much in favor of economic growth\nA and he has support from a no lesson Larry Summers who is a ... democratic stalwart and a former treasury secretary who also feels that\nTightening as what the fed is doing is premature so there's not a it's not that he has no intellectual support for his position so I think the fed will continue raising rates to the pain of

doing is premature so there's not a it's not that he has no intellectual support for his position so I think the fed will continue raising rates to the pain of emerging economies are who are who don't like a strong dollar\nA and a because and I don't think anyone's paid any attention to this but\nEverybody here feels a recession is coming in twenty twenty\nOr when the uh the high induced by tax cuts is over and in a recession the fed typically cuts interest rates by five percentage points right now we can't do that it doesn't have five percentage points so I think Powell is trying to get ready for twenty twenty\nOr so that if there is a recession he has some room to move rates down\nSo if the Democrats do win control of the house of representatives as us yesterday that they might do in three weeks on what might that mean for U.S policy if anything of the next couple of years what differences might people watching home from around the world and notice oh they're going to notice a lot\nOf the Democrats are will then take control of the congressional committees the house committees they will have the championships and the right to and the power to subpoena\nAnything they want if they do investigations people in Washington tell me that the Democrats have a hundred investigations already lined up on everything from a Trump's taxes which he's never revealed\nTo a cabinet members who they feel didn't tell the truth and confirmation hearings\nAre some are planning a impeachment proceeding\nThey want if they do investigations people in Washington tell me that the Democrats have

with it so we will have um more gridlock\nOh in ... at the Hudson Institute in Washington Let's check in with how the financial markets have made performing today Susan Schmidt is from ... investments I asked her the markets have reacted to the news that the U.S Federal Reserve appears to be in favor of mold rate rises previously thought\nThe markets have been anticipating the fed would increase interest rates one more time this year another quarter of a percent and then also again in twenty Nineteen three and potentially for increases\nFor twenty Nineteen sense what the fed minutes indicated today when they were released this afternoon and of course the market pores over those checking for every word change from the last report that was put out and right now I think there's some reassurance that the fed continues to see an underlying healthy economy in the U.S and they're comfortable with gradually rising interest rates\nAnd the dollar rides the highest full two weeks
