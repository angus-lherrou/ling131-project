anything like humans rate\nOkay we're going to dispel a few minutes in a moment what do you make of the concepts Chitra very briefly of the sex robots before we go on\nWell I find that really striking that human beings can do all kinds of things with technology and this is why we put a essence\nRice effects robots kind of feel ... and you know divorcing the sexual act entirely from feeling comes with risks or does it\nI I don't think it necessarily does we used we know that sex toys for example have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years the difference here is that the current form of ... is a humanoid form that's that's the problem because it tends to be a very productive stereotype of female body [noise] and\nAnd that's the problem why are we talking just about the female

power levels is with real life than not fear\nA but yes it is it's just this past the female form that we have and I I ... maybe the wife not because we have technology that could do wonderful things in terms of\nHelping relationships them in terms of bringing pleasure and it doesn't have to be in this form\nIt's open field for questions Matthew I'm kind of love is the venture into this minefield will have to admit pool when I saw that this was going to be a topic of discussion it\nJust before I let you in the morning but K. I. average don't shy away from you know I've I've noticed that my my mom has raised sitting it became well can you tell us how you go into this topic what drew you to this you know I wanted to address that question but I thought it was to read [laughter]\nWell I mean it's a fascinating subject area um it came about rainy from a sitting up in a pub after conference will come to the systems talking with a group of colleagues say what is it a bite develop have symptoms that can think why or why why why we're putting all this effort into creating\nA ice that half human like traits we have very specific traits that changed the way we think\nAnd sexuality is one of those it affects how we how we ... [noise]\nIt's kind of a fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like\nAfter a conference on cognitive systems talking with a group of colleagues said what is it a bite develop have symptoms that can think why or why why repeal this effort into creating a allies that have human like traits we have very specific traits that changed the way we think and sexuality is one of those it affects how we how we protested LTE\nIt's we've kind of a fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes ...\n[noise] yes I mean we've touched on this slightly already by one in ... I Want to explore more\nAre we not worried about what sex robots would mean for human sexuality particularly given that as we mentioned already designed by men foreman suspended straight men what are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes about an agency consent and rights\nAnd and also linked to that is not perfect analogy but when you look at pornography [noise]\nThere are particular racial stereotypes um that uh uh put forward and pornography as well and I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I slept Yale ideas Kate\nThat's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a a male straight while I'm ...\nI'm a last word Petra normative so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and I'm featured gender in this case um it's it's a month and a woman and it's it's um sex evils of China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today old tend to be in this um\nSalmon I type of sexual form and the old tends to be why does rile on whether they aren't where there there are all the different skin color they are as you say they're kind of exhaust sized\nIn this case um it's it's a month and a woman and it's it's a sex evils of China [noise] um I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today all tend to be in this um\nSalmon I type of sexual form and the old tends to be white as well on whether they aren't where they're they're adults with a different skin color they are as you say they're kind of exhaust sized um this is problematic and and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these things\nAnd just to check up or we act the technological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitate opposed ...\nNot ... the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots\nWith some of them is how sexy can they possibly be wow ... ... it's a kind of the nation I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time but we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these the I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly this also official intelligence as hyper realistic veal I mean\nThe ... or at least I can talk to you convince me nuts so they these are not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] this robot\nThese robots have personalities that are being developed you can carry around just download an app on your phone or tablets you can have a virtual girlfriend and your phone they're working on a a meal version as well partly um so I think that's that's probably a more realistic and convincing human than any rowboat\nWhat's being reception fuel bookcase oh sorry chitter quick point realize you're\nGoing to say just hearing you Kate makes me I'm wonder why people need but she'll go frames\nAnd weather is is this does it say something about but it's got boyfriends and girlfriends that I mean let's be honest it's not boyfriends at such a good friends that were talking about and does it say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll girlfriend who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and ...\nNeed but she'll go frames and whether it is is this does it say something about the people who got boyfriends and girlfriends that I mean let's be honest it's not boyfriends at such a good friends that were talking about and does this say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll girlfriend who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and ...\nI don't know how ... yeah I think that's probably about it and I think ... that tells you what's going to the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers and so we of course you know we're able to go out there and and bomb socially but perhaps men have more problems\nWithout Kate dabbling author of turned on south science sex on robots many thanks for coming on the program big thanks to August ...

responsive you didn't have to be here and they respond to how much sunlight is coming in and how much hate and the shortest automatic so I can\nYeah let me do the modeling of the house there's an assumption that you close all your cousins you date in the morning than you are in the end of the public so you know many people do not come home in the evening a fun it's really hard because the sun's been bluffing through the windows all day if you can get something that is\nPrograms and as the sun comes out they shelter tremendously are brought them if you want but she certainly purpose keeping the interior to scoot as possible\nAnd then people going through this now I'm more houses that with justice on the outside there is more\nTake help now a lot of it is called straight around passive measures full\nRetail and an offices but we'll see more of that technology rolling into the domestic sites as well [noise]\nSo what you feel that they have flat roof and this is all blew roof Kaye wrote and sent me to like a green roof so his ... his seat in ... on it\nFair Oh yes we can probably not from the Soviet the lightning\nBut\nIt doesn't look very you know it's been real hot summers as you can see you see them which suffers but then still receives so it's coming back now that we've had a bit of a bit of rain\nHere is ... it is a green roof but is also believe because relevant in the water running straight\nNot from the ducks the lightning\n[laughter] but it doesn't look\nVery easily you know it's been real hot summer as you can see the seed him which suffers but then still receive so he's coming back now that we've had a bit of a\nBit of rain I still I ... it is a green roof but it is also a blues because relevant in the water running straight through and in a way into drawings and yet they will absorb some of the water and that is a sustainable Jay system in itself\nIs designed to cool the area that will stores thousand eight to ... to find a very reinforce three well the roof is made out of the same\nSort of structure as the main building itself so you felt that strength of late to hold the extra weight so that's a ton of water it's going to be holding but also as the building can be voting for habitable space in the future it needs to be built up a strong structure\nAnd what's to stop once had you know during a ton of water what is it useful\nIt will hold it up then it will be allowed to release slowly so you can put a valve on it and it'll relationship so many leeches permanent as if it was just a mild brain rolling in a sort of flash flood\nBut in this case they can do that in storage to be used for toilets and a washing the water and they call them or would you be burning of major news unable to\nGet out there and say I get into acting or sometimes\nYes the the other is on the delivers within this as a solution so typical office blocks so if he does it being in the top floor of an office locked in the summer it really gets a lot hotter than anywhere else\nSo we watch my company at the moment who are doing a test of one of their is they put they blew roof on one of them they happen and they found that food this summer they haven't had to use on the air conditioning and the blue roof covered building while in the other one the controlling they thought they call them\nTypical office blocks so that it'll be numb to float enough is locked in the summer it really gets lost his than anywhere else so we watch my company at the moment to all during a test of one of their is they put that blew roof on one of them they happen\nAnd they found that for this summer they haven't had to use on the air conditioning and the blue roof covered building while I'm there for one controlling knife I call them so it was sort of a majority of the time\nSo that was a really really big difference in terms of energy consumption as well while we've got a lot of office buildings that we also have a lot of a residential\nHigh rises ... probably be useful for that\nYes whether you go for a high rise or maybe the mentioned broke approach we don't have to default to pitch groups these days I think there was a sort of\nFeeling that oh you you got a flat roof is gonna leak but the technology has moved on a long way now\nWe can easily get sort of your life expectancy on a flat roof and also stopped to build it up as a blue roof as a green roof by putting the vegetation on top of it it's still to some teaching the route to fish and protects it\nSo even the people in the book but it must be wasteful that's fine it's designed to for the wet but most of them is why you have a lot of exposure to sunlight close to tracking and the premise ... aging\nReason to some of my [noise]\n\nI think the difference in San Francisco surveying parent in the summer and I'm coming down\nAnd shit like way structure is timber\nAnd the insulation so that has the central part of aging than the one of the public has a

now I'm coming down this is actually a lightweight\nStructure is timber and the insulation so that has the central part of the heating than not one of the problems with a rocket construction and Ilene construction using this material\nSo what they did have was they create this little exposed slab so eight inch sits underneath the cyber itself is to\nSay this for that we've found on his cement concrete floor with concrete look at all in some polish concrete floor and I'm Renee ... is insulation\nYes oil flows needs to achieve a sudden you value so several months this one does with that but rather than cover over and lose that some of my the leading exposed and when it's ... degrees outside you tell him it's Twenty one twenty two degrees very comfortable mhm\nAnd nature took his own in the winter uh yes but it will retain that temperature at Twenty one degrees so it wouldn't be unpleasant but yeah you might want to put a few moments that may be\nHome it's like it's got to go on that one yeah I say this is a very lightweight timber construction you're sighing which is great in terms of\nUsing fear materials box it's going to warm up very quickly in the summer and get too cold and when to teach about law\nOr no because the ... the body and not\nJust from the federal ... adaptation of flu and also in seeding mislabeled which is the female thick so that again providing more dense material to provide that some of my\nKids and play on the ceiling which is normally found in this little\nYeah and the ground yeah yeah and it's a natural breeding material as well\nAnd what about the whole thing because the rules are still going to tell us to pay\nVery well insulated so the build up the rules is on the outside wood fiber insulation then between the thoughts is mineral fiber and then on the inside is cool insulation and they were pretty liberal so they rely on which to me\nMonths play on the ceiling which is normally found in this little during the ground and it's a natural reasonable material as well and what about the whole thing because the rules are still going to lead to lots of hey\nThey're very well insulated so the build up the rules is on the outside with Foreign Relations between the thoughts is mineral fiber and then on the inside is ... a middle reasonable so they're relying wishes to revive a false\nAlert like traditional Elvis used to but again the potential would be over eating but actually controlling it free introduction sort of um us\nSort of concrete basically just a price for he when it's to haul and keeps a when it's too cold is\nDesigned together we've had ... and the data scientist but those headlines is of course in cyber net aches can help us create not necessarily high tech or are they expensive materials but really low coast materials that can allow more accessible buildings that they perform in a more Boston wait\nThis is a Rocky Mount ... director of the Institute for advanced architecture in Catalonia however such just focused on responsive buildings made from materials to react to changes in temperature just like living plants and animals do let's\nTake for instance ... which is nothing in material ... they are ... that they have been used for prototyping ... and they have been also used by many users\nIn their plans when they go for vacation and they need to have a set and humidity in their plan so they don't dry out\nIt's not the source of Joe ... is it green sorry\nStudy usually it's in the form of ... and these ... which means it's a very good friend with what they're they can absorb water when absorbs water it's volatile mix bond so that the study becomes kind of a bubble that three things the water when they are\nYou have a set and humidity in the plan so they don't dry out\nIt's not the thoughts of Joe ... is it a green it's very study\nUsually it's in the form of ...\nAnd ... which means it's a very good friend with water that can absorb water when absorbs water it's volatile mix bond so that Greece studied becomes kind of a bubble\nThat three things the water when they are exposed to high temperature than these were all the stops to operate slowly and these ... humidity conditions it's also decreases the temperatures of this can happen for the blind in order to give humidity but it can eventually happen in the ... side\nOf the buildings skiing and this kind of loud that we can control and we can\nPassively cooling theater of the building in um heart conditions are you\nSaying that the building which in its structure how special kind of ... and you would fill it with wall shah and then it would respond to the house or temperatures trip I purchased cooling and that for cool the building down\nExactly it it functions basically as our body function when they sweat\nRight so when they um high temperature outside author of operates and we sweat you know did to control our body temperature so we are forcing buildings that they are able to have\nBiological let's say performances as a bodies of living organisms have so they can't sweat that can eventually fate\nOr they can also Greece\nAnd they can do that in lots more sustainable way because they can do that then the passing away\nAnd have you looked chance the exterior infrastructure things like pavements things like roads\nYeah we have been working\nBodies of living organisms have so they can't
