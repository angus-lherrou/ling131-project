World Service my guests today has become one of the world's leading public intellectuals who's focused much of his attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and others through the complex prism of race gender religion class on nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to dig deep into such questions comes from a very personal place\nHe is the child of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will connect ... politician in pre independence gone to\nHis mother was an English woman of Eris the classic stall Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy and law at New York University He is a gay man who's married to his partner have more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi led a sense of self can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on division we use race religion on a class to separate us from then increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to\nDecades so his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi lead\nOur sense of self can be and yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on division we use race religion and the class to separate us from then\nIncreasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict and hate\nSo is there an end to vote to this preoccupation with group on tribe\nWell Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now\nWelcome to talk to the beer you have to spend a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves so let's start with a simple question how do you label yourself\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm half a gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that's the that gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nTo you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of ... of your identity although ... are you thinking that you're sending signals to your interlocutor about about who you are\nI think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals some faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much as I think many people assume uh they they will so I I grew up in Guyana and my father was going to end\nBut that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am and gun or it doesn't tell you how much I never got us as I Am ... years and so on many people that would be more informative to know what the nationalities you know if it's at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the\nAs I think many people assume uh they they will so I I grew up in Guyana and my father was going to end\nBut that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am and gun or it doesn't tell you how much I Know about guys since I haven't lived there for that he is and so on many people that would be more informative to know what their nationality is you know if it's at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say that in in in all of your work on a race religion and creed as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves and to identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we're role so complex and so unique that almost any label we apply it in some way or rather misleading\nAnd one of the things one tries to do\nAs a political person I mean in in one's life as a as a citizen or trying to think about politics is that um is to try and undermining and reduce the support for the people to take advantage of this easy mechanism this mechanism of dividing us into a awesome them\nAnd to create a kind of solidarity based on false beliefs about what we alike and false leads about what that I I think those people are dangerous the world is full\nOf ... so you ...

I Believe that the trajectory of the human condition is in ... in that positive sense toward a more universal list a more\nHumane understanding compassionate humanity I guess how can you square that with what you see well\nUh I I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just five or ten years old penalty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect or in many ways over the last century I'll say for example\nThink about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting to ask people in many many countries over the last century look at the massive reduction in\nWell uh I I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just five or ten years old penalty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respects\nOr in many ways over the last century I'll say for example\nThink about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting to ask people in many many countries over the last century look at the massive\nReduction in a racial or discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of the increasing coming together of Europe at the same at the moment of these moments of nationalism\nAnd putting breaks it to one side which one has to do when you're a ... is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century\nSo uh or even in the mid ... century so I think what do they say if you look over long enough horizon\nYou can see the general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nOne area where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in the western world\nAh societies and cultures view a gender issues in particular sexuality I mean your your uh uh a known for very long time in out gay man you took advantage of America's change of the laws that that you could Mario long term partner\nHow far can we go\nWith the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways that we never even thought for not just in terms of\nOf sexuality but even in terms of of basic gender where now there is a a very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women are a lot of people who define themselves as known binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appears to be moving\nTo to accept them in New ways where does this end\nEven thought of before not just in terms of of sexuality but even in terms of of basic gender where now there is a\nA very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women are a lot of people who define themselves as known binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appears to be moving\nTo to accept them in New ways where does this end well\nI don't think he ends the two things at the airport but where it doesn't that doesn't end with the disappearance of identity we are reforming our justice system but by not getting rid of gender altogether I can I can ... I Believe that I live alone all into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nNow and there's the question is where the self identity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm blushing between different spheres but but I don't mind full on how to do it so long ago we spoke to a woman cold ritual dollars ... who\nIs a white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and on and live a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWe want being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nI think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between self ... and and another I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you can't simply declare the meaning of the euro and race all on their own race has a special category you need to\nSee if he does like where it's ... you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done the trans people have done what\nI'm black well I think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between ... and and another I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you can't simply declare the meaning of your own race all on their own race has a special category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's put you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trick trans people have done what Rachel Dolezal didn't do which is they've\nCreated a movement to allow them to be what they want to be in our system they've asked us to change the system have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity\nTo adapt the system in that way and even if they did a little bit of how do I masculinity I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nIf racial do they'll have could have provided a could've made these arguments on the side of the people in began the thing and if you could have done this in the way it was a little bit more\nStraightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved concealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that\nBut unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments and doing it that way\nIs if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do it with other people have to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you would have been very consistent saying it's not my job to fix the society is simply to understand and explain

you can share with me as as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nWell I think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division that's the thing that one's looking for\nSo that I think some things can be said a but these are the things that are known to social psychologist one is so close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identity tend to be less bigoted then people have done so don't allow yourself\nTo be channeled off into a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among 'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people live all the major kinds and do things with them that's not about\nRace or religion or or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about\nUm you know building something in your community together worked together with people because I think working together with people to divest identities makes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly if you have folks ideas about them as long as the falls ideas how leading you to behave badly\nI'm not so worried about the people have false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and it and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nA final thought we'd have a a thinker and rice or in the United kingdom called David good hot who said that these days the most important distinction and identity that that one can use when looking at people\nThey have badly I'm not so worried about the people have false ideas about absolutely everything not just

S. I usually go to Stuart security initiative on the other half towards various economic development and social development projects so it is kind of counterintuitive to try to caught you know the funds that I'd actually focused on what is the root causes of\nThis so you're saying but if those governments receive age in the United states more reason for people to prosper and their own country\nThat is actually what has been happening the cooperation from the United states to this country's have more and more fuckers precisely in this type of initiative that try to strengthen the country's\nUh it's not like now it's going to happen and and some of this project's actually show advancement in this topics specifically so yes these are the things that we know that have worked and that starts as I mean this is a long process\nBut that are starting to work and caught in it or does not help but\nTo President Trump's supporters would say that that aid has been wasted because it hasn't gotten rid of the problem corruption still run across ... countries\nThe power of the criminal gangs is gripping city centers and towns around the whole region and this age issue as opposed to them as pets the more you give them all the countries need where does it end\nOf all I I think the problem is that if you pretend to try to solve a problem that is very long time and not very short term strike complicated we're talking about countries that years ago were at war the democracies are starting even your view\nThe city centers and towns around the whole region and this age issue as opposed to them as pets the moon you give them all the countries need when does it end\nFirst of all I think that the problem is that if you pretend to try to solve a problem\nThat is very long time and a very short term it's very complicated we're talking about countries that there years ago were at war the democracies are starting even view and I'm not saying that I agree with it but there's a lot of people that actually could responsibility of the current situation on us and us intervention or do end as wars and afterwards\nI Do believe that this project how old so this is a slow process but this is the one process works if you say well we're we're not close the borders are we going to stop age\nWhat is that going to do is that going to help you know what's going to help ... case the U.S\nHow able oh the ... in these various countries to stop this kind of um of migrants posing through that countries\nThe problem is what's going to be the solution of what you gonna do about it if you're gonna you know accept them as refugees and try to establish camp center have support in order to those is because without support it is very limited what those governments can do and what shape that\nTakes is definitely going to be very political and that is the other thing ride the rhetoric and the elections being so close also make this a little bit more complicated this is not a problem of today this carbon is not the first cabin but definitely put in pension him more pressure because of its disability\nWhat other options on ... to the United states to try to stop so many illegal migrants coming through\nI think a lot has to do with the conditions in the countries and promoting migration that is documented and that is legal the other thing is that we do see lower numbers of immigration there are more immigrants crossing and everything but it's in much lower numbers that it was five years ago and it specifically for Mexico you see that a lot\nAnd the options on that are available to the United states to try to stop so many illegal\nMigrants coming through I think a lot has to do with the conditions in the countries and promoting migration that is documented and that is legal the other thing is that we do see lower numbers of integration in there are more\nImmigrants crossing and everything but it's in much lower numbers that it was five years ago and it specifically for Mexico you see that a lot definitely what needs to be done is support this concrete and the other thing that needs to be done is promoting migration that it's orderly\nThat document that that is that it that is checked because the other part of the migration is the man and a real factor is that the U.S unemployment is under what it has been in decades\nAnd there is any mind for
