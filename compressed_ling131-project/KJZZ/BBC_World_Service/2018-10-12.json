driving me was why was the rate of progress steadily increasing over time from century ... century the growth rate or any measure of improvement and standards of living with the girls or it was going up\nThe ultimate answer that came out of this kind of the rising about technology\nIs that ideas are very unique in the sense that when one person discovers an idea everybody can use it so the more people you have trying to discover things the more ideas everybody is going to have in the faster the faster the rate that they're going to accumulate\nSo what finally emerged was a connection between

universities and support for education but we also need to keep in mind how powerful this the sort of innovation machine ... of the market can be\nAnd then I think the right way to think about the role of government is to just nudge it in the right kind of direction nudge it in a direction ... which will be beneficial to everyone so like right now\nIt's probably not so helpful socially to have even better and better technologies for extracting oil and gas you know the new innovations like fracking\nWhat would be better right now is some technologies which lower the cost of low carbon

if we made two MB asked him self and it is important again to think from Washington's point of view that for a long time indeed the years that you are a very senior figure in the state department\nThere was deep concern about the degree to which Saudi Arabia was exporting a a ... hobby religious ideology which was\nEncouraging dangerous extremism and many other parts of the world where Saudi resources were being invested in mosques and ma dresses and what have you\nAnd NBS addressed all of this and he said the Bloomberg just a few months ago he said look we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without a civil war in our country without stopping the country from growing on with continuous progress in all elements\nHe asked you said with regard to human rights if there was a small price to pay\nIn that area it's better than ... paying a very big dent to make that move now\nIn Washington there is still residual suits\nGet rid of extremism and terrorism without a civil war in our country without stopping the country from growing and with continuous progress in all elements and he asked you said with regard to human rights if there was a small price to\nPay in that area it's better than ... paying a very big debt to make that move now\nSurely in Washington there is still residual sympathy with that sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been in the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen Seventy to the Iranian Revolution\nThe Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly but Israel now enjoys the best relationship\nPolitical foreign policy intelligence that they've ever had\nAnd so you've seen the substantial changes under Mohammed bin Salman but at the same time Steve and I think that there's growing impatience and now outright anger in both of our political parties in Washington and inside the Trump Administration over what appears to be an entirely reckless inhumane\nBe steel act by the Saudi Government to kill one of its own critics you couple that with the the problem with the Saudis have cause any ... by prosecuting this ill considered very violent war against civilians in Yemen

think would be the right move\nAre interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures in the last year or American\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia with some Eighteen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more arms and virtually any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... and sixty percent of Saudi arms importance that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether you believe\nThat the Congress for example is now going to ask really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia is really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but\nI Do think two things may happen one is you might see I think you should see if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom and been solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia bought his

Dan Damon with wild update there's no counting the millions of lives saved by the discovery of antibiotics in the early years of the twentieth century\nWill the twenty first to see the end of the effectiveness one of the reasons might be the widespread use of herbicides which is adding to the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria\nThat's according to new research by scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak hind them an from the University of cancer brand new Zealand where else do most of the connection between herbicides designed to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nNice surprise at all all of that is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria proceed both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the time the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are or toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you get established will affect the bacterium respond to these\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the ... the bacteria that we study but the bacteria don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are were toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you get a sub lethal affect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for pumps that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapts the bacteria for exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so then herbicides in a sense or vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics and\nThis is happening this protest is on the way the most harmless of sounding places anyway ... thanks loans where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together and these places because for example you might\nUse herbicides on your lawn\nYour cat uh or your neighbor's cat might walk through your lawn walk back into someone's house where there is stroked that puts her side and application levels on their hands and they made touched their mouths\nIf there are also on antibiotics or if the taxes on antibiotics we now have a combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study\nWe found that that particular combination went herbicides and antibiotics come together\nThe development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost\nA combination of herbicide an antibiotic in this latest study we found that that particular combination when herbicides and antibiotics come together the development of antibiotic resistance can be up to a hundred thousand times faster than when there is no herbicide\nWhat can be done professor\nWell first and foremost we have to have a much better understanding of all the different kinds of chemicals that are in commercial use for their impact on bacteria in these sub lethal effects on bacteria presently were unaware of any regulatory process in the world that asks these kinds of questions\nWhat would happen when these bacteria are exposed to some leads a levels of chemicals that are people are routinely using either and work or at home\nThen once we have some sense of what kinds of combinations of chemicals could induce antibiotic resistance that could inform us into\nPossibly revising what we think of as appropriate use of the different kinds of manufacturing chemicals\nCan you imagine a post antibiotic era\nI can imagine it but it's not a very very pleasant image\nThe post antibiotic era will be like pre antibiotic era except we won't have the hope of new antibiotics so we have to be very very careful with the antibiotics we have now and the fuel yet to be discovered so that they continue to be useful to us in the future\nProfessor jak kind them in more than a million people were killed during eight years

reticent when it comes to hunting of an inch of war declaration various reasons for that that includes the fact that they have twenty eight thousand five hundred us troops based on their soil it may

why do you need to have ... you know military exercises\nAnd these trips and I'll just basically for North Korea they're based here strategically so one of the reasons why the US's reticent about
