seems the issue of the Irish border and the ... stages of Northern Ireland are\nObstacles that cannot be overcome\nDisappointed maybe I'm not surprised but I'm not without hope so just let me take this week because everyone's quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um well what is happening as the talks that continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of\nNorthern Ireland on the island of Ireland is the issue is that the withdrawal agreement if\nYou like it still has to be completed on because remember it isn't just the e you or\nMe as an Irish MBP or the our government insisting on this the United kingdom the bushes prime minister\nLast December signed up to\nAn opposite of commitment that there would be no high borders no return to the past on the island of Ireland peace it's that in March in fact the text on the table addressed withdraw divorce if you like agreement and the incomplete parts

risk if the new deal bricks and if they have to be some fan of restored nope\nNot to use those words are your words but what I'm saying it's what what we're told me more than I tried to explain this to David David says one missing when he was at a party where they the Brexit negotiations that to understand the psychological impact of breakfast you have to\nBe their lives there and I lived and know what has happened and I think that's the part of the discussion that people aren't hearing\nAnd you have to obviously a respect different views on this but at some point when when language is used like ... blood red lines out some\nToday for example I read I wouldn't even say it on television was quite a vulgar comment about this I thought what going too far here and that's like comments required but also understanding that the u._k. is leaving the EU breaking\nShocking now so much energy from the European Union and they do everybody's been going on to say there are a much bigger dangerous and challenges facing that you and for you as a\nAs an official with with a sort of overview as vice president of the European and I don't know fish on the front of a different that's fair

this fuss about ... what we don't seem to be focused on is that certain countries in the like Poland and Hungary legs are simply refusing to play by the use rules and accept\nBasic and your values when it comes to things like a free media and independence and the judiciary\nAnd I think we all should be worried about that of course we're all concerned about it that's why I voted that there should be and ask us having a review of what's going on in hospitals seven ...\nSeven doesn't work because not only a poet and hungry for themselves but they are acting with the support of a block of

and I said to him my concern about what's going on in his contract at so bill under no illusion that why breakfast is a big issue where also dealing with those other fundamentalist I'd wanna portions they at least within the European Union you have the capacity to feel and I\nWant to bring out to go seven which you say is not going to work\nWell lately which match you say we are dealing with it under article seven articles suddenly restricted last year against Portland this year the polls have pressed on with these judicial changes which have been told the president basically getting rid of

familiar with in the past so in other words they performance that we say is excellent\nThe issue is trying to make that happen for a long period of time since ... and ...\nProfessor Steve right well pioneers in the industry say these limitations could yet be fixed a new generation of batteries in the next year or two\nCould double flying time all the same some of those involved in driving than you tack like engineer every bar chips star top vertigo era uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric so\nShouldn't have batteries in the next year or two could double latte flying time all the same some of those involved in driving than you tack like engineering bunch of ... era uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWe're working on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an onboard generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's\nAre they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York\nOr London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft\nAnd the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think it's a nice traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have to have slow regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very careful\nJudge cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have passed laws regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says Oh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok\nSao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on tops of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting in and I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now from those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere it's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic passing\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus in less like a taxi\nYou're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\nAre a bunch of ... to go arrow hair on business day from the BBC that really for the new tech will be when these flying drones but come on just a novelty plaything for rushed overpaid business\nThree of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option and then it just starts to grow from their\n... over ... go arrow hair on business day even the b._b._c.\nBut really for the new tech will be when these flying drones become\nNot just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are a viable option for ordinary people that you will may well some Seventy or eighty stocks opposite battling to develop the hard way and ride sharing tech them ...\nAlso is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job and galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but really but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but is this going to start in Europe and America or is it going to start somewhere else where about half the regulatory hurdles less Hi\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and it just a natural fit\nYeah a lot of islands to jump over ... less dangerous for that reason because I'm you know\nThe land I guess but is this going to start in Europe and America or is it going to start somewhere else where about half the regulatory hurdles a less high\nYeah I think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and it just a natural fit\nYeah a lot of Iowans to jump over about ... less dangerous for that reason because you're not going to crush onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight you over the water most of the time but you know if you look around the world a lot of the a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\n... besides it's hyping to pilot flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas New York or Paris\nAs soon as twenty twenty five but does that actually unrealistic shut you give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to overcome a professor Steve right from the university the west of England well is this the worry\nFirst time we have a ... an accident which can be attributed to machine\nAs you can imagine people kind of lose their minds to face\nAnd say we're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and not providing pulls facility for us in the industry back in the seventies I think they used to be\nA helicopter taxi service operating around New York and then it flipped over and killed ... people and\nThey're not really done it since have they oh what's the Pan Am building wasn't the weather's a helicopter\nCrashed that that was cool like us and say again we have problems in developing these new technologies that oddly enough this is one area in which the technology actually sells the problem we've had in the past\nI think the the ... that will pay an easing in period way the public needs to get used to the idea\nSo just in the same way that we had the the the person walking in front\nThat that was cool like us and say again we have problems in developing these new technologies but oddly enough this is one area in which the technology actually sells the problem we've had in the past I

drug ... boss taxi I but I Would love to say I mean this is this is the question everybody asks me my particular hunch timescales is ten to Fifteen Years\nNow the thing is I'd love to be proved wrong in this case because I really well my flying a a really well by flying taxi but the number of hoops we've got two and should jump through as well in order to make sure this equipment\nIs demonstrably say not will take time in the in the sense that we read and just now deciding which hoops we do need to jump through\nOf aerospace engineering Steve right and that's just about it for this program ...
