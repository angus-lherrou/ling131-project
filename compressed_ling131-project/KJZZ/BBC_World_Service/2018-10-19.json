important\nYeah just because some Republican doesn't mean I don't believe things you know global warming you know you just need to do what's good for the general population\nLet's say you're the

bullied\nSo young people they don't like it because every time Trump treats them of the friends that are not the same point of view is I see the see you see a Maxine Waters saying get in your face you know running people out of restaurant is is the Democratic congressman yeah and she's on TV saying you know or\nPromoting riots actually this is terrible loss was not a complete\nThe president you can hardly denied he sets a tone and if you look at these tweets they are nuts warm and fuzzy out that he he sets a pretty well last time\nWith the ever notice he never strikes first there's always in
