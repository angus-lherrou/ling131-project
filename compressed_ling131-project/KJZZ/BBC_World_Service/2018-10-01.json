eye\nTo the private money ... thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances that lead to because I was in an eight and to the collapse in two thousand and eight so we bought\nI'm getting too is that the John Macdonald ... the the current shadow chancellor of the sticker here in the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one

cap on the amount of David and to be received by each work on the excess beyond that would go to the government so it would actually be a huge huge corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the state and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote for that\nI think so and I'm very glad to have hut or John Macdonald put forward there have been proposing to McDonald about in the program we eras things you've been saying society proposing is precisely that\nWith one difference I've been proposing the creation of a social fund where that ten percent of the shadows after every ... or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund\nAnd then the dividends are distributed the formal universal basic dividend\nWhereas the Labour Party is leaving them up amongst the workers with any of those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is

think is very important to remember this is not even need the money factor yet this is part of the Labour Party conference in may go into the money if I saw hope it does it is a very interesting

you\nHave studied over the last two or three decades all of the range of these infrastructure project caliphate GM is another one isn't it a port in northern China champion by Hu Jintao or a former prime yet but it's come to nothing I mean there have been white elephants as well as success stories in China\nYeah Charles they did was to become an ecological zero sort of emission poster child but it didn't really succeed are there are many reasons behind it\nBut the shoreline this case just keep in mind that within the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned businesses\nTo this new area so it's a little bit different from the other big new projects in China this one is really read top down\nProfessor young so I mean that

twenty thousand sensors around the whole city is a future hotel that that include human being free ... when they planted thousands of trees around as a dancer but beyond that public service Centre it's still quite\nA quite barren where basically still feel good lead an almond trees surrounding the or central services center\nWell George maintenance is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... basically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects and it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand eight actually as the financial crisis in the west stone to discern ripples through China um and uh\nI called it has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects and it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand eight actually as the financial crisis in the west started to send ripples through China um\nAnd uh it was actually a time when the Chinese economy itself is actually going through a little bit of its own kind of tipping point\nSo really what's happened in the last ten years in particular I Would say that the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so every time they called me looks like it's looking a little bit worldly\nAnd you get ... more infrastructure and to make more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments are on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about a ... and leads to you know better growth\nAnd she is a huge contentious issue because some of us believe that she the sequencing works the other way round that actually you get better urbanized ... from having good growth model\nOr because actually if it was that simple than every what do you need for groceries just build ...\nPlus of course as a ... a declining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever and it wasn't always give you the same time that it did at the ...\nYes indeed I think again you know like so many things in China everything is so nuanced so if you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure has a population of course it's still some way behind Japan\nA soul in Asia or you know American cities in European cities but um you know as long canes that kind of famous British economist ones that in the long run we're all dead and what we have to be concerned\nIt seems so nuanced so if you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure had a population of course it's still some way behind Japan\nA soul in in Asia or you know American cities in European cities but um you know as long canes that kind of famous British economist one set in the long run we're all dead\nAnd what we have to be concerned about really is about the miss allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks coast cities and and actually quite a lot of problem\nAnd it can also leader goals to huge amounts of public debt where how biggies Chinese public debt well a ... it\nIs about ... at the end of two thousand Seventeen was around three hundred and thirty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nThat sounds like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fat whether that there is any magical number at which point you know a crisis ensues but certainly the the miss allocation of resources the cumulative increase in difficulties which smaller Chinese banks are facing\nUm funding that loads of what they have to raise deposits and\nIf they can't raise them from households they are raising them from increasingly a novel a tile an uncertain short term sources and I think these things are contrived to to bring about kind of some uncertainty now\nYou've written a book called red flags I mean how much jeopardy is China and from ... and other risks\nI think I'm trying to that isn't the only problem that China faces that it's

that's including increasing the slice of the dairy market available to us producers from about one percent two three point six\nPercent and the dairy farmers are not at all\nHappy about it they're saying that really this is putting their their future of the future of their families at risk especially since Canada this is not the first time that Canada has increased access to its dairy market as

system around dairy\nThat was the original us demand it is very much pare down there just getting more access he's also promising full compensation for dairy farmers in Canada so that should take some

down here in Washington is a quick thought you mentioned that this is a kind of deal that will appeal to some of those votes as in the post industrial Midwestern states which should be so important to

play to support workers and the industry and to strengthen the steel industry and limited street for the long term that's one piece\nAnd put in place dollar for dollar counter terrorists so today's deal since very positive because it's moving forward in a positive manner and I've spoken with prime minister and I've spoken with history of trade on August or they are committed to\nUsing this

aluminum but we've also put tariffs on a number of other\nSteel products and it will be and everyone's best interest for us to to get rid of those tariffs the two or thirty two which which is essentially\nIt doesn't it it is it's not good economic sense it's not good for anyone so I think that cutting off the ministry ration of putting the two thirty two on autos which would have been devastating for the economy is on all sides was critical in this agreement\nAnd also supports the steel industry because that's one of the number one and places where the steel ends\nAnd briefly um than President Trump said he was in love with Kim Jong un yesterday do you think he's back in love with the Justin Trudeau\nWhile I can tell you what the minister Justin Trudeau has been absolutely
