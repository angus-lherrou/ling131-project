now by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care\nThat means that it's an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd leave what difference might the pipe bombs and the outrage in Pittsburgh ... what difference might they make you think\nI think there's a tone in the closing days of the campaign that can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things that were going on in the last week\nWhere people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issue that is to talk about in partisan terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the find a week or a big midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on\nDonald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issues that ... to talk about in partisan terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the find a week or a big midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the stage of the country\nAnd Lee has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nWell I think it's interesting because there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worse they say\nWell you know he's got some odd characters things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind there's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nOr who are facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you're stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may it there is relatively little difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges after a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so\nOne group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges after a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading the party and leading those people who who voted for him two years ago\nOn if I also can add something about we've had shootings in the United states without a lot of mass shootings over the years\nIt does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before an election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncover your what about Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women on the things he says a bug women which might average women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nSpent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects opinion\nAnd what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerge and be very distinctive is among those people who identify with neither party\nOpinion and what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerged can be very distinctive is among those people who identify which neither party\nOn independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I I Would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of act critical group of voters\nAnd the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates that these these independent voters and especially independent women and independent women who may be in the living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably the group of voters that zero in on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party I'm much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton I it's really losing the influence how do you see badly\nBut I you know [laughter] I think there were a couple of primaries that sort of guide some headlines I'm not sure that we have anything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point\nOther than there's a lot of globalization among the Democratic party I don't think the Democrats at this early pick sides as to which part of them is going to dominate the process I think they're unified in their opposition to President Trump to this point\n... if the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be done\nIn other than there's a lot of mobilization among the Democratic party I don't think the Democrats are necessarily pick sides as to which part of them is going to dominate the process I think they're a unified in their opposition to president jumped at this point\nKen if the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short concept from each of you or how much can use it for the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate ...\nWell I think you do that and I suspect cats will agree with me the conventional wisdom maybe right on I ... how is likely to go democratic in the centers like this stay Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of the Democrats but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representatives\nThe Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the Senate just because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats who are on the ballot this year\nIn a very few Republicans who
