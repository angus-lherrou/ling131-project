hiding\nDuring the ... is professor in in ... and it's amazing technology at ... university ... ...\nWe were interested in seeing how far\nWe could go in using the difference between human audio protection and machine on your perception because humans of course how some limits\nTheir perceptual ability for example after a very loud sound human won't be able to proceed very quiet silent but free speech recognition system it's just the fame and there's other effects like that so not only can you not hear quiet sounds after an hour south\nBut also when you have a very loud sound at one frequency for example let's say you at the very very our coach\nFifty herds them then you won't be able to hear very quiet sounds like at fifty five for its really close by to that loud sound and all of those so called cycle acoustic masking effect\nAre utilized already by many gadgets and checks so for example you were an MP three player also uses those cycle crew stick effect\nTo be able to work with very compressed audio files an MP three including you only in cold that information that is rather than that just protect to boost to human listener and you can\nThrow away you can discard parts of the sound that won't be perceived or maybe not in ... them for precisely so there's a lot of tapped out there that's using those\nUm cycle ... masking effect but we were wondering if it would also be possible to use them to hide\nYou only in cold that information that is where I live and that just protected the choice human listener and you can throw way you can discard parts of the sound that won't be perceived or maybe not in ... them so precisely so there's a lot of tech out there that's using the ...\nCycle ... masking effect that we were wondering if it would also be possible to use them to hide information from humans which\nWould then be very clearly proceed with the for an automatic system\nRight so it seems from your research that there are ways of am betting and doing so imperceptibly audio signals like malicious ... within very sounds and they might be able to check up or something like what about your voicemail systems or elect so have you\nYou have another example which involves an autonomous cars joins lift vehicle is what is that well\nThe idea is really that if we had\nStep more control by voice that we can use that very same attack factor to make it for example in in our example activate the emergency brakes by voice\nSo that you all you'll being driven by you know told them it Scott Simon and Garfunkel on the radio\nShame on me\nI mean that music sounded normal to me but now we're going to have that same bit of music but you modified it in your research\nAround ... am I on me\nWhich to me frankly it sounds like the ... that we played in the first place but in the second clip of the Simon and Garfunkel this is even better it's some kind of come out and that will trigger the call to do something then\nYeah it's actually so we embedded a combined after they eat and merchants he breaks and law all door and of course that's\nNeeds pretty train me to a very scary scenario where um\nFrankly it sounds like the ... that we played in the first place but in the second clip of the Simon and Garfunkel this is even better some kind of come out and that we should get the call to do something then\nYeah it's actually full we invented the combined activated merchants he breaks and ... all the war and of course that's\nNeat pretty trained me to a very scary scenario where\nYou could imagine if you were you were in the future\nPeople being actively of put at risk by their says driving ... if those gaps in security aren't really so\nYeah so you mean by the college go on and I asked my six speech recognition yeah the yeah I'm Sorry I missed like ... if you'd actually set out loud to put the brakes and found the\nObviously this is proof of principle and bumping but you point to an end you'll probably be you haven't actually done this or you were the act as a you know you just go straight to the voice recognition system so that made me very much a proof of principle\nWhen the medication that our system currently have\nAnd the second imitation is that we're currently assuming that we know all the parameters of the speech recognition system so in effect for attacking\nThe speech recognition that we've trained ourselves it's a ... system so it's a speech recognizer that is very widely used and the research community and we're pretty sure that it's also used in many commercial systems\nThat we definitely need to know all

taking off your sense twin is our system looking at it all puts or if you can actually go and use the parameters and some other\nThat we definitely need to know all its parameters and the competes

looking at it all puts or if you can actually go and use the ... and some other way for example by having somebody inside the company\nOr is this book is very experimental it's the ... at this stage but what's your main message that you want to get across from this research\nWhat I really think it's that's currently at the point in time we're companies offering speech recognition systems should look at how to make their system robust against the kind of in that town\nYeah that's an understatement I think there were attacked costs that we need some ... ... security of the system and it's really hard to make it because it means is\nThat there is a whole over to an all full of of adversarial exhausted pools ways a newer networks and mushy learning systems ... they just tries to an

wearable if you just think about it was really developed to describe something we don't wear what we where we call\nClue and that really sets the stage for really what we've been focused on here which is really getting technology into the things you actually we're into your clothes into the fabric and into the fiber themselves\nAnd that really is what sets us apart and and what makes this point in history so special\nSay are we moving beyond like that will find strands of cup of waving in food like a black T shirt that you just buy from the local store and then sold ... onto a piece of ...

literally a few weeks ago\nThere were no real reports on how to get semi conductors into fibers and into fabrics and without semi conductor is your phone is not smart at all [laughter] without semi conductors we don't have computers and without semi conductors we don't have displays and we don't have communication [noise]\nAnd so um what I wanted to focus on is the importance of getting semi conductors into fibers end fabrics as an enabler of functionality and enabler of you know I don't like to use the term smart or we could leave that to describe humans\nBut certainly something which is highly functional and technological in a day\nDo digital revolution happened after all because we go good ah I'm growing components transistors and ... and said wait for it so that could come and go

Copa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but it woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures\nRhone a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat war is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall rabbit raised with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is a great ... of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast\nAnd so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the normal ... Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane\nIn the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you can pin down the Pacific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that's that's an estimated as part of past research by climate scientist and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast industrialization so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as an affair temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform or changing of the S. S.
