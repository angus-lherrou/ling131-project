arrived enshrined in the constitution\nI think what Trump is doing his uh his base certainly is for him on this and I don't see any problem with him trying something and then\nGoing to the courts and letting the Supreme Court finally resolved this issue it's a troublesome issue but it's not an as overwhelming has the caravan problem\nYes now how much influence do you think that we'll have the migrants caravan over the outcome on Tuesday\nI think you'll have a great deal of influence at minimum it will galvanize the Republican base which may have cool down a little bit over the Supreme Court appointment issue picture I don't know a flotilla of boats leaving Kelly with ten thousand people\nAre determined to get into Britain one way or the other\nThat's about where we stand now they do have the right to seek asylum\nAnd the problem is that it has to be a credible proof\nThat they will be persecuted if they go home\nThat requires a long hearing and so on so that you will have these people some of them will seek asylum that is legal entry into the United states as things now stand uh they are assigned a court date and about eighty percent never show up they just melt into the population\nSo the president is planning to build tent cities or he calls him very nice tense in which these people will reside onto a there are cases heard\nSeek asylum that is legal entry into the United states as things now stand or they are assigned a court date and about eighty percent never show up they just melt into the population\nSo the president is planning to build tent cities or he calls him very nice tense in which these people will reside\nUntil um there are cases heard and that would be months and months and months rather than just release them into the population and hope they'll show up at a court date which most of them do\nSo much of this is about seeking though isn't it so I mean the president sent more than five thousand troops to the U.S border even though I don't think these people are a ... for months now it's it's about signaling a head of a very important election isn't it\nIs about seeking linked to the second caravan that this is a useless exercise and signaling to the voters that he's a pretty tough guy and he's going to stop this uh on the other hand do you do have to get the troops in place remember these are not guys going to stand there with bayonets\nSparing a little Honduran children are these people are a lot of them are engineer's a lot of them are medical personnel or they're there to build a facility to hold people pending they're hearing\nAnd to make it has humane as possible\nThere was going to be plenty of votes as though who think look America's an immigrant nation Donald Trump's himself he's descended from

immigrants are you looking at me and my father was an immigrant but we're a nation of legal immigrants are as for the employer's attitudes look employers have always favored immigrants because the weather is\nLet me doing reasonably well now we need people we need work is to try and fuel that economy well\nFirst of all we are a nation of immigrants are you looking at me and my father\nWas an immigrant but we're a nation of legal immigrants\nAre as for the employer's attitudes look employers have always favored immigrants because of whether it was the Irish in Boston or the Jews in New

another reason that they are against it and then finally you have\nA split here between an elite or which um feels good about doing humanitarian things and favors cultural diversity and the great mass of people who are paying the cost of cultural diversity and crowded schools and crowded hospitals\nDo you think it's a mistake to see these people is cheap labor though I mean why don't see them for the potential that they have you had great potential when you have to American these people could end up his brain surgeons into highly qualified and technical engineer\nLike absolutely I mean America is probably better at assimilating immigrants than any country in the world if you look at the problems in Europe and other countries\nBut it has to be legal immigrants you can't just say well\nUh I'm anyone who wants to can come into the United states we won't check to see if you're a terrorist or we won't check to see if you've got drugs or\nCriminal record you just come in but basically we are a welcoming nation I think Trump is not he keeps saying we're for legal immigration and we are but then he keeps reducing the number of acceptable legal immigrants\nSo you'll protection for Tuesday a couple of weeks back he was ... she thought the Democrats would take the house of representatives is that still you'll feeling\nCheck to see if you're a terrorist we want you to see if you've got
