would think that in India people would still have repair skills\nAre we mistakenly\n... because the older generation of sort of bad is getting lost the ... living in um a nuclear family and uh uh via

viewed away from us\nSo in this uh back if you have professional to better also sitting along with us along with volunteers [noise] uh so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better they are not taking their business surveys\nDiscourse here my my points to go ahead what we find there's obviously politicians of it is about saving the planet but it's also about saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair uh\nObjected assessed tend to be told to calm the retired\nSo what we do is we do at least the assessment for free and then maybe we say it is worth taking it to retire so we take out some of the expense or on the person is going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in the ... cafe time have those games\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that the professional repairs who'd become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repair professional repair is too expensive because\n... some of the expense or on the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be mended but are we in RIMPAC halfway done have those games\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that the professional repair she'd become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repair professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is sex tidy so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that's labor she'll be tax lower so that\nA professional repair to become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business and um [noise]\nI don't know of course there will be different on labor costs in different positions of welfare so what you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nAfter listening out there for\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work in terms of cost rely on people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that as long as I found out when I paid a visit\nTo a landfill

so ... can you ...\nThat you've ... but there's not really much point that it wasn't anything to take you to pieces and cleaning around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good that the ultimate equipment it's just\nIt comes down to the ... in ... to about twenty quit or ... or somewhere like that to repair it was a real ... ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour

county is designed says she proceeded um than you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if they knew it couldn't is going to be generally cheaper than the old equipment I

busy I just turned ...\nIf disarming says she proceeded um than you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if they knew something was going to be generally cheaper than able

they're too busy they just don't have the time\nYeah obviously people are pretty busy that day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around\nWho are very conscious about their environment that that same bad movie get in some parts we get ... just phones because people want to do their bitch in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they had actually doing a lot of that sort so that things don't go to lunch and\nMost you know I Wonder if you could kind of ... or some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe\nYou you would kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because you know that already on board with the environmental movement without ... how'd you get the other people have you ... the other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip you are quite happy just to throw stuff or\nWell that's a challenge of course but we hope to get them into the repack cafe when they have something that they really want to hang on to win that when it's a fresh is broken object that cannot be so easily replaced by the cheap you time [noise] and we know that\nThat's what happens when people come to the ... cafe they don't really expect things to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable society\nWhere they were running short time no disrespect by in Holland is still still guarding the people that are fixing the machine the polls there\nYou say they don't really expect things to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable society\nRunning show some time now his RIMPAC cafe in Holland is still still going to some people that are fixing a coffee machine that pulled that Paul has a chapter with a large Sean again into the workings of the device some final thoughts and from every Friday ...

surprising like this has caused some outcry not just from the police but also Britain's home secretary the phone since bank down on his campaign ethics direct to Henry James admitted a bit of a mistake that but she said the campaigns will not about to stop\nObviously we took a huge amount of backlash which you know they had a personal cost to us in a stall that same time it can't be she

host of things that we will care about and we built a business that suddenly became big enough that we could use all shop fronts on our website to actually talk about the things that we were campaigning about in a private lives so for us as a huge buying on those issues it's not marketing thing\nOkay so this is all just heartfelt stuff it's not anything to do your saying with the commercial end of the business know how's it affected the commercial end of the business\nWe have to rule when he first started campaigning publicly that we would never on judge a campaign by its sales Vegas that we would never look to chew up at the same time because it would make you hesitate to ever do win again so that little ... and we largely stick to it as\nEverybody wants to be right now how is it affects your say oh I can\nTell you they don't want to because actually surprisingly it puts sales op\nSo when the campaign people came to you saying that sales were up this was during the spike ups campaign that was getting all the negative publicity\nYes yes during the spike up campaign and yet it wasn't on campaigns people it was actually our accounts people came to us and made a phone call and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know and hang on in that\nRegard because any news is good news\nI think it's cause any news is good

trying to sell soap or other products cosmetics if your campaigns are served as Britain have absolutely nothing to do with that I mean why marry the two in the first place\nI guess we marry the two because we've built this huge brand we're on high streets around the world and it would be almost rude not to allow the people that are working on the issues we care about access to plant facility that we have built\nSo you've got a platform we have a massive platform do you think it is now we're living in an Arab perhaps where it's allowed for for corporate ... and ... to take a stand for these more overtly controversial\nI Do think so yes I think that younger people coming up care about the things they care but they used to talking on line to other people who care about them and

of thousands of people and we didn't you know there are many ... to pop peacefully protest now what we saw yesterday were two things one is the you know that there's been cutting off of\nA train line

group protests has got to the doors of parliament they look to be storming parliament's at one point and riot police came in um ... we used to using some projectiles that brief clashes push them back\nAnd I think what's happening now of ramifications looking at the slights a fault line now in the independent as movement which is is you have the president came to ride the separatists catch it on President who said yesterday that protest district keep pushing it's working so now the\nAnd it's at one point and riot police came in um ... we used to using some projectiles that brief clashes push them back\nAnd I think what's happening now of ramifications looking at the sites a fault line now in the independence movement which is this you have the president came to ride the separatists

groups of whales are found floundering on beaches usually that means that got lost and confused and sometimes they can be guided back out to see about the discovery of sixty eight trivia wells dead on the shores of Scotland and Ireland in recent weeks\nSuggests a much bigger problem with uh put it into context to yeah to a year is considered to be a normal figure here we have\nMore than sixty I've been speaking to Andrew Brown low director of the Scottish marine animals stranding scheme\nThis is a little different to what we would normally see in in ... when you use your mortality events because I'm the carcasses coming at a show of incredibly decomposed so [noise]\nUm we we are she had an investigating this less pathology point of view in more from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed up and then they die they're dead when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an ...\nI shall arming credibly decomposed so [noise] um we we actually had an investigating this less smoke pathology point of view and more from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed up and then they die that that when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at ... or the causes mortality of of mammals uh stations sales et cetera\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what a cold must running events where we turn up on the beach and the uh I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the wars that some of them on the beat some of them alive some of them that\nI'm I'm way investigators try and work out wind is trending happened in this case it's it's a very different picture of what we've seen is over the the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidents of\nI'm a very unusual species that's being washing up a light from the sort of the the go away by an island all the rights to the top of Scotland\nUm so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks at sea um but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows\nHow many in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen this year\nSo in a usual year um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she by ... by these these class substitutions\nI'm On this year so far um we've had sixty eight of these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland on foot\nUm we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she by ... by these these class substitutions\nI'm On this year so far um we've had sixty eight of these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland I'm forty five alone in ... which\nIs [noise] they live very deep and the water they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible speculate might be happening\n[noise] well this is what makes this quite tricky because the um that they as you say that there are species that live while off the shelf hedge survey they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal\nUm they've been clocked to just a under three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down there\nThe reason they go into the the the such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these these ... to a a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for this species\nI'm now ... there's the problem is is that when these animals wash his show is very limited amounts of pathology that we can derive from from the makers of in such a expensive states of decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species is particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human ... underwater noise in an in specific the effects of mid range segment on\nOn that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf hedge I'm In the last a couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the million and bottom\nAny ideas because you know human\nIt's particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human ... noise in an in specifically effect to mid range so now\nOn that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf hedge I'm In the last couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the million and bottom\nAny ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and the seat for quite a long time that something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nUm indeed it does I mean we we've we've made the actions of I'd noisy place in a ... of the general problem in this specific case\nFor them we have is is that this out of the people that off the lights the major Einstein all off in the military and loving information from that and can be quite challenging\nUm the reason that the military health writes a an a sudden this frequencies is that it's used for um communication and social used for locating underwater objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive it a national security level so they're trying to get the information as to whether they'd be not pricing can be challenging\nHowever what we
