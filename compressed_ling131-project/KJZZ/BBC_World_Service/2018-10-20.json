connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information the knowledge and how to improve their farmer or a bottle of disease now so we farm we enable those farmers

think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get good content people in such a simple format or so when the former U.S as a question for example on on as a mess\nWe don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis to match them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question\nAnd getting up his will contend back to the original farmer\nNow you you go to a million members I think he just signed up a million the million member ... what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people\nYeah so it would pass a million which is as I was a great milestone for us having to one point two million I'm I mean I think the first in biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know to put in context as is probably nearer seven or eight percent on Twitter um you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month\nA which gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fun systems here there's not a social system itself I value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so\nI think that's probably the primary indicator would say uh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information\nWe find is necessarily a fun systems here there's not a social system its value for their businesses\nPeople don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it

they're seeing from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally and information that's helping save their their livelihoods and farms through before\nIt was an example of how it's being used as an example\nI I Would give is that there's a a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called called castle he kept something in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods you know pay for his kids to go to school up at dinner and you finally table or on a disease was ripping ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days\nOr any ask questions about this and we farming or get information back\nAh which vaccines to you is how do I just thought the disease spreading a and he managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of light so you know often seems to us very basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers but that we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny you in from we from a Mona El Salvador from ... in a special guest uh uh that was one of those red now public a

like to begin by asking each of you\nWill seize identity politics will do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think a ... that has been given and is used to describe planes for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to demonstrate equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the um because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that has less to do with the identity of a sudden than with questions of justice we can talk about that a little bit more Adrian\nPast what does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized against the individuals and small groups very often focal minorities that's how I ... for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship humanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the

us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in in countries so there's a problem I think in that\nIt's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than more communal or collective response\nYes among yeah to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality came in riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and not on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAnd sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re send to the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about groups has ... elements of the state line to try to [noise]\nAnd we thought rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic can lead spinning abstract things are done resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to dodge and nothing none of his very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you're a venue to any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... ... what's that\nThat doesn't ah to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think

what the tea movement did they said look\nBusiness love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what heterosexuals want and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will justify what looked like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about Pakistani origin American standup comedian who falls enough with a white um how can we go into sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which that movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying what isn't it problematic that this round protect them as has to find a white wife couldn't she has found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the writer was saying\nWho cares if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was part of a left\nBut some of food that was problematic ... size leave for me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and avoid cultural appropriation they needed a picture in a movie of interracial relationship is probably not very identity politics just to come to ...\nAnd race we should celebrate fat and was part of a left\nBut somehow for veterans problematic exercise leaving me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society one because I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures Robin where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably about ... identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value as the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I left on the left all my life who isn't for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression\nAnd structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we don't politics into a kind of ... Hollywood wrong call model I Would\nBring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of algae beauty rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful is on a an an ordinary social level not\nIdentity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from which you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an artery social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're gonna think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word\nYou might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful\nAdrian it's the intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also political correctness on ... pops and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow to differences defined as more than the county of close to a real difference is out there to be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out and she says how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm\nBut at the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's the way that politics has become\nDo you live on strike I I really would like example is I mean I I\nSo we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and remind you of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be won\nBy the memory simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's the way that politics has become\nSo do you live on strike I I really would like Exxon tell us I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nLet me give you a couple of examples the first one I wanted to make clear but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers is also true but the majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice but you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's two white\nPeople get shocked by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this high off ... people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual states this is new to me\nTypically deepen justice but you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go after parties\nYou should also be worried because actually there's two white people who got shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this tough people have never lived in monoculture religious monolingual states this is no send you a\nSituation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is because a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee and along the function political parties trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations in the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis was a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the center then Tuesday it's by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier\nUh yeah ... well it's legit disagrees with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a ... ethnic multi cultural self conception of themselves and find God who started to challenge that and we now live in society so much for most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that\nThat is something you talked to quite new Priya\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth and one of the ways in which they're addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by it\nWhich most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic society but\nThat is something you talked to quite new Priya\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which they're addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by is minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for now to our panel\nGrandfather Gopal yes among Lenore try an Adrian pops we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think that the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't care what UK or treat me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a pulled cost you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll cost [noise]\nDistribution of service from the U.S is very possible by the American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio contract a piano\nMerit and public meeting with support from a financial services for him of Raymond dreams offering personalized wealth management advice capital markets are expertise with a commitment to put in clients for natural needs first more Raymond dreams dog home\nIf pressed their ... because they're working ... not because they're white there was no evidence to tell us that the white looking to us it was out doing disproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino all black ...\nWhich is an interesting and important point I wanted to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German state elections in Bavaria what happened that this is a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to see if you which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes was still at the end of the biggest policy but a much smaller but a policy than it had been hemorrhage rates the greens on one side and the anti immigrant AFDC on the other meanwhile the S. P. D. which is the leftist sent about ... ...\nIt seems that voters are choosing policies which have\nClear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm white time working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and his biggest space people pushed\nLate into the anti immigrant AFDC on the other meanwhile the S. P. D. which is the leftist sent about ... ... it seems that those his entourage choosing policies which have\nClear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say hey if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm lifetime ... I Do feel happy and the biggest space people pushing themselves into\nWhat I think now because the mainstream parties on offering something that's inclusive been off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course the working class is not simply watching lots of other components of the of the working tops have suffered an often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against the status quo and and who are we to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much less the mass of all there is no that's not I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying is\nThe idea that somehow we can just say\nWe only ever look at the most depressed people in the early ... an in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the Persian Gulf in a rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe are people who are involved each we have people who embedded in relationships institutions are not since feelings do methane fatal belonging and and they were going to place to people to communities and countries matches we can all today that feeling out of politics or religion\nThe obvious question that footage from that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease positive reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense and on the longing that actually that that identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were well\nYou had a noted about how there are these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland\nWho onto weddings and these parts of the reasons for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense of on the longing that actually ... the identity that was that before whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinctions it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe than they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say ... voice is a very clear that on the door a bull in some ways it was six if you'll never end or a movie in India and you\nAh preach ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it wins bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic um in the same way that asking people to identify\nIf you'll never end or a movie in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it winds bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country\nThe idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic um in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClumps sorry I'm confused I\nThought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with logic ... it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam\nIs just a bit too big to get your head around to break into small groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's a little bit of politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad language singled out yeah I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ... and the question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society in a productive manner\nBut one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan when I look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because ...\nAnd the question is how do we deal with this in ... to the society in a productive manner\nBut one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of neat for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me for the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim it for ourselves to make it inclusive to say that either hire\nA collective uh it is a level of you know the kingdom of looking at states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under the common identity ... how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots ...\nOf patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you
