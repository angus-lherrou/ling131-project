achievement in political terms before he took office President Trump was deeply critical of the original North American free trade agreement calling it the worst trade deal the U.S had ever

not be obvious to prospective buyers and the show them that they are paying more or exactly why\nThere's a wide question to underline President Trump's assertive approach to trade is a preoccupation with the deficit and us international trade the country by small from abroad than it sells to foreigners\nIt was a theme he returned to repeatedly when he sat out the new agreement with Canada and Mexico to the media the United states and its trade deals he said has lost on average almost eight hundred billion dollars a year\nThat's the deficits don't trading goods and he wants to get it down or preferably eliminated\nThe trouble is that most economists don't think that trade balances whether a country has to set up as well deficit are determined by trade policy most will tell you it's about spending and saving a country which spends more than ... and we'll have a deficit\nThere is something else that President Trump is doing that he doesn't to pay to think age linked to trade policy tax cuts\nIn fact one way of country can spend more and save last is the government has a deficit in his eye in finance is now the economic relationship it's a very complex but it's certainly possible that lower taxes and increased government borrowing could mean a pick a trade deficit\nIt would be very premature to come to any conclusions about whether Donald Trump is being good or bad

it's bigger than when he took office that is what the data shows that could only aggravate his view of the U.S as a victim of bad trade deals and bad trading behavior so we can expect to see a lot

I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to a new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will be still be producing in twenty seventh day\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gets ... well\nI think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on cold in the work\nBut it or not oil we're talking about oh yeah those are my point\nIs that if you have replaced coal plants root for example of gas or even oil\nThat will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually if you do\nThe ferret Christopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then to drink\nSing to replace it with and when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough so we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if yeah do\nYou separate Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then to dream and the parents see because actually it might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long a county and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty expiration if in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... find out what's next in and out came back a few years later\nAnd my ... mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said now China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to the national conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway as the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford\nMaking a plan to get off that feels good ...\nI Would look at the time frame because college but says well it could be dragging on two twenty Seventy yeah you'd will and it will be like if you base your numbers on I eat a international Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production\nLook at the time frame because college but says well it could be draining until twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based\nIf we go to do a big big job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge job ... on on how you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is to know where he smoked and we'd be debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built in ... new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with but that hold as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself it's green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough is anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become used to have I been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment then\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it seems so\nStill difficult to sell these ideas\nHow ... does anybody else in a bind well it's difficult in a way that it's become you see I've I've been working environmentalists just for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see act but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify yourself in this I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that\nWe're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can can kind of\nTo look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable\nBut where do you get to ... do so well uh you get to a perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our Lance part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that a ... that's called at three new now they changed the name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or at the same time\nThat's ... that's called actually knew now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's start with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green is a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it\nAnd the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\nGay or at the same time we have to address CCS and his view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nBut now we don't have which have successful even know ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers do\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like no the the wages\nThey stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there is a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we're\nCarry you wants to come back and see if he has his definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually agree on is it just makes a yeah what we need cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take a call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYes we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology is it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government to no way are shifting governments have spent quite a ... a lot of money to try to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and the staff has been focused on in our right for Twenty years I think the also an aide to challenge to politicians say with a greater sense I guess I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas\nDouble and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't know what are shifting governments have spent quite a lot with a lot of money to trying to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again CCF has been focused on and All right for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nWe were going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do let us know what you think that the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC don't Kendall UK and you can subscribe to the ... such the b._b._c. the real story you'll pulled coughed up\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio contact a pie and American public meetings with support from you wash your Craig bourbon handcrafted in small batches for a full flavored sipping experience\nAnd we're working with local uh energy company here are the regional\nAnd we're actually looking at it together with the communities and the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will\nBe beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is is really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan with energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries and what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is ... ... with\nAnybody else yeah I should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because for a shift nation and I was being so there was\nI'm an engineer why would I Choose to walk into anything other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy securities of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuff we talked about there's only two developments and then to reach the Arctic to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really a growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of his other issues we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in the room so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually we had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students\nSort of this other issue is we're dealing with and I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in ... I think he would rather study of renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan come and say well no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American I'm a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift to even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expense and the a matter of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made it out there I Know but it's ... it's it sounds like it doesn't exist sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got the both of them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that ... and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries that the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf over ... new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument if you will see now that you and your ... and then she will indeed be more cost\nIt is now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening in other countries that the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well would it close higher polls apps absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that when you're ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia\nGave does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there isn't a terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the barn she comes from her first comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies playing some people might not so reasons to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to these powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia China and ...\nAnd the parents said they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this expression area that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the bar and see and I don't think\nReason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China and ...\nAnd the parents said they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this expression area that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think\nIt's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and love bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat that is according to the carbon project and if you see the court and Brazil has been originally sees this summer it is a totally different pictures coming up now so if the covered prices high in Europe I\nGuess we'll exclude coal we've recorded lay on what you mean by that call them price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nUm there's a market inside Europe and the prices have been already fishery low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices are starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push out renewables\nStill and would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing in Germany they are afraid to be able to carve uprising no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seems to nibble energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are\nActually competing and you mentioned Russia and the situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean obviously Norway count recount take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is ...\nSeems to new energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and the situation in Europe in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an expert of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're going to keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but but this is about what kind of view do we have for Europe past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with no way relatively poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people are ... the the way which treats citizens of the fact that he gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that is going to keep it well see but with no way somehow lose some of it stasis is no way\nAfraid pot from some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting of far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas remember your along the coast in Europe or the ... the only place\nOnce again you know you you you painting as far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before ... came\n... made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we may develop a state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the has this the only place in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on and thank God\nWe didn't have an ability we we have again Terry in society in looking\nAt a lot at the history and one important object in the in the Nineteen seventies supposed to keep them moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years\nAnd then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states but we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying myself too tightly to oil we should ...\n... but I guess I think what I'm asking is it somehow psychologically has it allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nThat means yours anyhow I mean we have we have a well\nThat means yours anyhow I mean we have we have a well for states that's actually very clever because we have this big fund",
