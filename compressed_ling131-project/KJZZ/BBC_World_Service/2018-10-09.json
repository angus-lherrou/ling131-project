being you know relevant to economies or to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing its own or Thursday\nAnd one of the ways to do that has often been to exclude women because women was seen as perhaps being more dangerous or less serious or an intelligent or whatever because of the way that gender roles\nOf being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being excluded where they may wants to hatch\nAnd don't pay anything because that would lend the field moral authority how active\nExcluding when the ... more authority absolutely and

having ... boots\nRight say imagine if you're living in a very ... location away from your family's you don't have access to clean drinking water you don't have access to clean toilets each other basic needs of any human being what is happening to the rangers have\nDoes not have access to all these things at the same time the walking ... extremely dangerous conditions because budgets on on

stealing these animals from the forest and also they are going through the\nMentors stress rain just have to stay away from their families and we have done a study on their mental stress and it's it's it's very shocking say what what what's the situation is that ranges of walking under that seemed a difficult dangerous conditions Wade noted combination\nIsn't it the case that you know by not having the equipment they need and as you say suffering high rates of illness because of wherever working I mean that's the bus but he's going to make anybody not wanting to go the extra Marlin doing their job of particularly if a job as a dangerous one\nThe absolutely and ... but it was quite surprising when we did the subway it's also a is the largest ever study done on ranges and we were quite surprised when the rain just said they really want they're they're really proud of their war they love what the tea but at the same time we have to make sure\nThat if you really want them to continue doing this war than we have to support them be have to give them equipment for example the basic boots\nHalf of them don't even have boots and they end up spending their own money for buying boots and uniform when at the age range of salary is nine dollars a day which is more or less than actually uh somebody makes in in a McDonald's\nSo how do we how do we change the situation I mean clearly it's there's up to the governments of the country is concerned but I mentioned you know we have big wildlife appeals people give lots of money can can confirm about not be diverted to the ranges a it is being on drugs it is but where's it going I think\n... so we have to look at three three levels of solution number one is the rangers\nOh somebody makes in in a McDonald's\nSo how do we how do we change the situation I mean clearly it's up to the governments of the country is concerned but I mentioned you know we have big wildlife appeals people give lots of money can can confirm about not be diverted to the rangers or it is being on the opposite but where's it going I'm\nNot exactly says so we have to look at three\nThree levels of solution number one is the rangers or the government employees so uh do you mainly we need to look into the policies that are beside the recruitment afraid just training of ranges their insurance ballot benefits they're family very sad\nAnd those reforms needs to come the ... the the challenge we had as early as we didn't have the on the fiber data that we can take to the politician saying okay now you're ranges out and really bad shape change your policies now we have that information so that has to be done all the ... groups and\nI'm interested people need to come together to address the policy and number two is all the conservation group also need to invest more resources and the basic needs for example a piece of study clearly shows\nThat are the sites where and Jews are supporting contribution groups of supporting rages wages and better access to clean drinking water so maybe we need to\nInvest more into the basic needs of ranges and number three which is equally important is to create away in this about ranges how do we make\nAnybody in Asia and Africa do you have the feeling young young generation that it's going to be at age ...\nJust one very very quick point there I mean how confident are you about is going to

that philosophy a it's a professional class plus various other groups women minorities\nYoung people that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine\nBut the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this enormous group of voters that have slowly but surely over the decades\nMoved from the Democratic column into the Republican column and for many years the answer that the sort of pundit class in America would give is\nThat's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can do about it what if they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong then if they get power back\nThat's the name of the game isn't it it's short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up and then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way the sort of political situation in this country used to be after the nineteenth\nBig as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong then if they get power back that's the name of the game isn't it\nIt's short term thing is

Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four was only two brief interruptions or the Democratic party was\nOverwhelmingly dominant in this country and the reason for that was because they

that version of themselves beginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition in around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it\nYou posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give us Jones is at the moment\nNo remember I had all sorts
