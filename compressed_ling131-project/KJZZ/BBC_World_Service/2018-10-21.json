journalist based on Burleigh organization for various civil society groups which you are leaving at the end of the year that's right I Do reflect on your time\nWell I've seen that for six years and they've been pretty depressing um I mean I think if you look at the evidence of what's happening on civic freedoms around the world for examples rasa because monitor we you know we've documented serious threats to one or more civic freedoms the you know the rights that we have to speak out take action come together\nUm there have been serious threats in more than a hundred countries and just

been serious threats in more than a hundred countries and just last year including some mature democracy or\nPromoting as I should and that's about protecting than promoting citizen action the we live in some worrying times [noise] a resident of\nBrief or to you about a I have to some because newspaper with me a big splash I'm Paige H written by you this is reflecting on the couch in London yesterday by people voting for a second referendum on the deal for Brexit\nWhen you write something like that give them that you know the will of being covered on the television on the radio extensively by the time I pick it up and read what are you trying to you trying to say and do\nWell that's more of a sketch I ... rarely\nAnd say it's a little sort of reflective vigil stories are coming out the people you yes which I always think it's a nice nice patch that is that you Kevin you find that people haven't found\n'em and you make it life lazy people do so under it because you're quite right by the by that time effort nice that was much yesterday you know when you've got a report on something like that is not is that what you're saying it's revelation unless something enormous happens that\nUm and and you're covering it from that side say so yes it is much more of a sketch and and that's quite fun to write but it does mean oversee or trying to follow and you'll find asthma sending in your co pay and which is never again when you've got that many people it presents a journalistic challenged the cause\nAnd everybody you know you couldn't get email because I was saying many people that that was a little bit tricky but that is that\nFor her it's there it's on page rate [laughter] uh it's eight minutes past seven GMT President Trump has confirmed that the U.S plans to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia he said Moscow had repeatedly violated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty while America had ordered it\nRussia has denied those US claims so who's right\nThere's a little shaky let ... is that\nSo hey it's there it's on page eight [laughter] it's eight minutes past seven GMT President Trump as a confirmed that the U.S plans to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia he said Moscow had repeatedly violated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty what America had on a date\nRussia has denied those US claims so who's right President Trump pulled the Russians Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association that is a U.S based known punted on organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nWell the United states beginning in two dozen fourteen alleged in I Believe it's correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred kilometer range limit allowed by the treaty and began to deploy a small number of these missiles\nProbably somewhere in central Russia off and on efforts through diplomacy to\nThat they have an presumably that's the game in money talks and with so many people many countries desperate for investment the Saudis have surplus money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi this for for two billion or ... pounds of of of five billion dollars worth of annual trade\n... at the trade but as as much in favor of the u._k. so that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi or we propose to give this up and roasted price residents\nWell one of the things they love Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm willing to skate Nuys or other things that we have I without yeah I mean at somebody like that to somebody having a midlife crisis leaving leaving that reliable\nAnd ... and gathering and finding so the old days out there and more dangerous friends and I think um willingness to ... come on to that with safety ... tales of leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country want to be the policemen of the world is this a wrong or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church is different set of values that we in the west\nOperate on what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from to keep 'em if some reports\nYou want to be the policemen of the world is this a role in or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church was different set of values than we in the west operate\nOn what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from to keep 'em if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nWas murder is always gruesome regardless of how it takes place um and I think ah the ducks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping dripping information and then saying don't don't take this ... authorized sneaks so important to look\nAt at at the whole thing in context social she was ... and he was um as as Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials and I and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation bugs how does that how's the world would react to it\nCosts ... happening in Yemen and they will still gathering and very happening what what do you think about not\nWell I mean the Yemen crisis is is is another one you've got it it's it's not the subject is operating there it's Iran with who says\nIf the straits of of um of marriage in the south is the red sea coast that's Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through the straits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us\nAll goes through there it's it's ... you know you could argue that Saudi has actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west who would be having to pay the price for it one\nOf the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is the sort of fragile and complexity of political settlement in the middle east what\nWould happen if the west actually took the boats that does not propping up the Saudi regime\nWell I mean that's what's happened in two thousand\nBut he was actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west who will be having to pay the price for it one\nOf the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is that sort of you know for a job and complexity of political settlement in the middle east what\nWould happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWell I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of false us and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not early Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but the Shiite extremist and done and you you have and then you've got the oil is um we have severe political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions from steel which will still dealing with no\nThank you very much into becoming ... really simple as we look ahead to that event in Saudi Arabia this week [noise] it's a twenty two minutes past the hour we'll get away with some music because meddling pay ... is an American singer born in the state of Georgia she grow up in New York and California but for many years she has been living in Paris\nMulti the gene don't know\nThis is ... the final track of her new album and submit so originally from upholding bipolar Edwin from the time of the world war two the album was mostly written in the U.S during the last\nPresidential campaign there and when Madeleine came in she told me how the political debates at the time left that mark on that album\nYeah I Am doing you know line trying to Sam\n\nEven there when Madeleine came in she told me how the political debates at the time left the book all about al\nYeah I Am ... and then on the line and try to assemble God\nSigned a vegan\nAnd early to thousands sixteen we started doing smaller venues and little clubs around the United states\nThroughout the primaries and caucuses 'em and various debates and the ins and outs of the day to day news that I felt was worth addressing a little bit in our shows just so that I could introduce a song and say\nThis is dedicated to anyone who's not represent doesn't feel represented by the government and then do the song and we'd get laughs in some places among other places we'd get like\nAn angry jeers but the state of our shows just felt the atmosphere of of politics was unavoidable and different from any that you experienced before a little bit I mean the fact that the news\nInvades our lives in a way that it didn't few years ago and certainly not Twenty years ago when I started doing these little clubs and things like that and yeah so I just started to feel like it would be great if some of the stuff we could talk about it instead of just trying to find a clever introduction to a song and\nSimultaneously Larry climbed who I've worked with many times over the years had just started by saying you know let's come over here and let's try this thing where we all sit in a room together five of us and that's what this was a group of musicians have rights as all collaborating effect yeah almost you've been to\nDining changing chain and then my\nClient who I've worked with many times over the years had just started by saying you know let's come over here and let's try this thing where we all sit in a room together five of us\nAnd so this was a group of of musicians have rights as all collaborating effectively yeah or even just saying yeah\nYou know changing chain and then my\nOn the phone lines so [noise]\nUm my hero [noise] ...\nI mean one thing that struck me because I Know there was one particular review that Iraq which talked about I think other than what was your comment or somebody a alongside you talking about the danger of being I think the word was pre ... ... and it's a difficult balance isn't it because you want people to enjoy the music\nAnd the lyrics with it but if they don't necessarily agree with the center but it gets more difficult\n[noise] yeah but I think even beyond that it's just not artistic to stand up and say you know here's what I think and you should agree with me and if I keep yelling at you because I've got the stage you know I've got the podium because he ... paid to come and see the show or whatever it is that that gave you\nThis audience it's so presumptuous to think that people want to be told what's right but it's\nFar more artistic to ask a question and it's more fair and it's just more right no birds they\nName at the ... day\nYou know that\nI heard them say\nNo don't do well on what he's doing\nThey're meant to tells personal stories\nA bird stage\nName and number ... day\nYou know\nI had heard them say\nNo to home what his parents are doing\nThey're meant to tells personal stories and uh\nThat each one of these stories is you know these are\nMeant to be such a sort of like life life experience type stories like down on me where you just can't get out of the circle of\nDebt or find some kind of financial ruin that might have just happened by accident and you don't really know so yeah these are all stories that I think are relevant to my experience of America is and their stories that I I think I intended\nTo at least for the most part said hey let's let's talk about this and um\nYou know the song and some wasn't the starting point but it ended up being the summary\nAnd ended up there for being the title and so this recording of this poem by ... carries the almost like the book and sort of like the counterweight to answer this quest for what is democracy and freedom and what does it mean\nYou didn't grow up in frogs you spend a significant portion of your life in person I think when you were there that had a huge influence on the style of music that you have gone on to to play it

you know of course also there is just a genuine appreciation for American jazz in Europe that does\n[laughter] it's ironic because it gave me more of a\nUnderstanding of how important my American

better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the
