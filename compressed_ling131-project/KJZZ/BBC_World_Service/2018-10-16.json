{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KJZZ", "content": "And that's why when opportunities came to work across the aisle to do what's right for our state I was willing to buck my party so I've supported a ten million dollar increase for our customs and border patrol agents of five billion dollar increase for ice agents\nAnd have voted for legislation such as hates law\nAnd the gang removal act which allow us to crack down harder on these bad dangerous guys who are committing felonies and hurting people in our community the reality is that this is an issue that I've been working on my entire career it shouldn't be a partisan issue and it's not a partisan issue\nOnly when some people choose to make it part is and as Martha\n... and have voted for legislation such as capes law and the gang removal act which allow us to crack down harder on these bad dangerous guys who are committing felonies and hurting people in our community\nThe reality is that this is an issue that I've been working on my entire career it shouldn't be a partisan issue and it's not a partisan issue only when some people choose to make it part is and as Martha has done does this become a fight in the United States Congress\nAlicia when did you pull your name off the recognizing Americans children's act earlier this year which dog targets dreamers and support streamers you were for about all of a sudden you pulled your name off of the what was that old\nSo I've consistently shown that I was willing to do something on DACA but we have to secure our border and we have to address the root causes of why we have a ... population the first place\nTo make sure that we don't make the mistakes of the past and so as we were working on this issue when the president kicked doc doc at a Congress appropriately\nMice and men and a couple of other Republicans sat in the room for many many hours and came up with legislation that would solve the issue secure the border and address the issue of DACA and when it was brought up to a vote kitchens cinema voted no we had\nCompromise bill which was twenty five million dollars the worst to carry the president still supported it and a pathway to citizenship for DACA\nBut it close the loop holes of the cartels are taking advantage of right now and we were in the midst of this discussion\nIt look like some people were going to force a vote on just a stand alone bill related to DACA I wanted to make sure it was clear we've got to secure our border I'm willing to do something on DACA but we've got to secure the border and close the loop holes\nOf the cartels or trafficking people into our communities and the opioid crisis that's killing Arizona's every single day\nI jumped in and let on the issue and character was given the opportunity to vote yes\nSome people were going to force a vote on just a stand alone bill related to DACA I wanted to make sure it was clear we've got to secure our border I'm willing to do something on DACA but we've got to secure the border and close the loop holes\nOf the cartels or trafficking people into our communities and the opioid crisis that's killing Arizona's every single day\nI jumped in and let on the issue and curious was given the opportunity to vote yes or no\nTwenty five million for border security and the second bill\nPlus a pathway to citizenship for DACA and ending family separation she chose to vote no along and Nancy Pelosi ... quickly do support a partial government shutdown to fund a border wall I look I don't support shut down for anything I've been in the military\nI've seen the the the the devastating as a result of government shutdowns Washington D. C.\nNeeds to be able to get their act together and they need to be able to fund the government and fund our military\nBut you know given that opportunity last year when there was a lot of pressure from ... base to address this issue\nShe voted with Chuck Schumer to shut down the government choosing a legal immigrants over our troops in a partisan play so she talks again game about working with anybody but when given the opportunity to actually solve this issue she left our troops hanging\nOn Mars they continue to talk about very partisan bells and very partisan activities but the reality is that during this discussion of talking about immigration how to solve our problem we do have bipartisan legislation the bill you mentioned had that Martha removed her name from I'm a co sponsor of that legislation\nI was actually the first Democrat in the country to join with congressman Carlos Curbelo of Miami to sponsor that legislation and I ... sponsored an original co sponsored a bill called the usa act which I mentioned earlier which both secure our border and provides a path to citizenship for dreamers Martha has chosen not to support that bipartisan legislation\nMentioned had that Martha removed her name from I'm a co sponsor of that legislation\nI was actually the first Democrat in the country to join with congressman Carlos Curbelo of Miami to sponsor that legislation and I go sponsored an original co sponsor of a bill called the usa act which I mentioned earlier which both secure our border and provides a path to citizenship for dreamers\nMartha has chosen not to support that bipartisan legislation and instead has chosen to support only legislation supported by one political party\nAnd I believe Arizona deserves better\nAnd so when there was a opportunity for folks to get very partisan which they did and they do on a regular basis I was part of the bipartisan group trying to solve that problem we offered are building usa act unfortunately partisan leaders in both parties rejected our proposal\nCongresswoman mix Sally you mentioned family separation at the border\nDid you support the Trump administration's a so called zero tolerance policy at the time are there any circumstances under which you are okay with families being separated that way this administration because of the laws that are on the books was put into the situation where they had to either and fought for the law or keep families\nI think we need to do both and my bill and the uh the second bill that cares and voted no on would've ended family separation it would have provided an opportunity for there to be due process and keep families together while they were they were process for their illegal entry or process for asylum\nWe're also increasing funding for immigration judges so we could end this catch and release\nLook the reality is the cartels know right now that if you show up with a kid you're going to be let go I've got a call this weekend from the you know mayor saying he was panic that two hundred or more people every single day we're going to be just let go into a ... and they didn't have the capacity because they showed up with a kid and we're seeing the activity\nWe're also increasing funding for immigration judges so we could end this catch and release\nLook the reality is the cartels know right now that if you show up with a kid you're going to be let go\nI've got a call this weekend from the you know mayor saying he was panic that two hundred or more people every single day we're going to be just let go into a ... and they didn't have the capacity because they showed up with a kid and we're seeing the activity increased every single week\nAs they cross the border illegally they know they're going to be let go there is also a case of the border patrol are telling us about where people are not the child of the person who's bringing them in\nAnd this is increasing the incentive to traffic children across the border so my bill fix this legislatively and had the opportunity for us to enforce the law keep families together and that was the right approach\nYou know she can talk about different bills she got on but the one she had a chance to vote on the one that was a compromise that President Trump supported\n... end of family separation fix DACA and securing the border with turkey voted to support sanctuary cities she voted to cut eyes she's very dangerous on this issue I mean I make sure we secure our borders Ninety seconds for bottle please\nMartha shared a lot of information just now that frankly just not accurate the reality is if the Trump Administration made a decision to separate families at the border in an attempt to try and provide deterrent\nBut that is the wrong decision separating families as not reflective of American values\nWe can both secure our border and keep our country safe and secure without taking children away from their parents there are ways to do this quite easily by monitoring families and moving them through the process of education more quickly\nBut Martha has chosen to move down a road again very partisan and she says we have to compromise legislation I think she means compromise with herself\nIn both secure our border and keep our country safe and secure without taking children away from their parents there are ways to do this quite easily by monitoring families and moving them through the process of education more quickly\nBut Martha has chosen to move down a road again very partisan and she says we have to compromise legislation I think she means compromise with herself because there was no bipartisanship in any of this discussion which is incredibly disappointing for Arizona and\nAnd the reason there was no bipartisanship as because Nancy Pelosi decided that Democrats were not going to join and you think about it President Trump supported this bill and he took a lot of flak from it from both directions\nTrading securing the border closing these loopholes moving towards a merit based immigration system and providing a path to citizenship for DACA I mean that is the definition of a compromise on this issue look most Arizona's agree we got to secure the border and family separation and address these other issues\nAre do as a confidence building measure that was also addressing the very real security issues of the cartels that are trafficking through these communities this is not just hypothetical children has forced random barbed wire up at the international boundary you saw yourself when you went down there was Family Guy to secure the border now\nWas family separation as your opponent has a choice that the president could have made to keep these families together as opposed to what used to use the law where we had no choice\nBut the law on the books is to enforce the law and so he ... their minister Asian was put in an untenable situation whether you're either enforce the law keep them as they get I think we can all agree family shouldn't be separated but I think we can also agree we need to enforce the law\nBorder security is national security and the definition of a country is that we control\nYou wouldn't use to use the law where we had no choice but\nThe law on the books is to enforce the law and so he ... their minister Asian was put in an untenable situation where you either enforce the law keep them as you get I think we can all agree family shouldn't be separated but I think we can also agree we need to enforce the law\nBorder security is national security and the definition of a country is that we control who is coming in and out of our borders\nSo enforcing the law superseded keeping families hunger is\nNeeds to fix this had it's our job to fix the law and so that's what we've been doing and that's what I'd been leading on and curious and voted no on both these bills that would end family separation the law is law\nThis is a very big difference of opinion between the two of us\nMartha has chosen to be an apologist and support anything that her party asleep puts forward whereas I've been ranked the third most independent member of Congress I'm also been ranked the third most bipartisan number of Congress\nAnd it's because I'm willing to stand up against my party to do what's right\nAnd when it comes to the issue of border security I worked with Congress and Matt Salmon others in the delegation to increase the ... the employees at the customs and border patrol in Arizona by a hundred and Seventy members I also have been endorsed by the customs and border protection agents in Arizona\nA and a nationwide and the reason is because I've shown a willingness to stand up and do what's right even when others are doing what their party tells them to do so on Martha is trying to find\nExcuses or apologies for this behavior the reality is we should just call the balls and strikes when the president's doing something right support him when he's doing

to committees are groups are companies or whatever um and it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she's become this kind of your head and progressive movement\nAnd does that mean that this race and this one district does as we heard there from the former math become this bellwether for how the Democratic party use is running and where it is going\nYet so the um progressive groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the only ones that this kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make the case in other swing districts that they can win and then they should get national support because look ... and did it\nIs there something about what's happening here in Omaha Nebraska has brought to to the top in the Democratic party or is it simply or a national picture\nSo the demographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this isn't the year for progressive and you're seeing that here as well as elsewhere ... we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally
