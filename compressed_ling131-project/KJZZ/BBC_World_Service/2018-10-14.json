have little ID cards and on those not just the financial details or your rent a criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so there's a real social change

no connection to our country is really dealt in Africa and anything in the listener is we have been a few publications that are questioning his stance on Africa Africa's again about he was one way or the other areas just\nA lot of people will be quite surprised to hear this but except perspective that said much in recent years what do you see evidence ... being a racist [noise] when\nYou look at the relations in Malawi has quite a large Indian community and the most of them run businesses and they are business owners and there's always been sort of conflict between\nIndia and business owners and allow in way 'cause the Indian ... doesn't leave him ... doesn't really socialize with a list or the White Mountains in the community so from my perspective there's a context to that argument\nAnd yet there is a significant Indian community in Malawi ... and as you said you have the Indian government building this conference center [noise] here's\nThe point from in the gum and perspective is more or less like how they argued in gun away the gun in government was forced to take his stature yet my to my gun from the rest of the argument they've been ... been sort of cardio relationship and

Malawi statues are a bunch of things on\nA I'm broke too absolutely I think what's interesting about this case is it really is it comes out of this outgrowth of a de colonization pan African his

name 'em and even the rose must fall movement at the University of Cape Town with black students talked about it is to make violence\nUm worse you know racist policies across the university needed to move this uh the statue of suffer road to the sinister colonialists I'm across the southern African region so I think\nIt it's it's a bigger kind of conversation that's happening across the continent

first of all the uh the the speakers what's that going to campaign to have the name of the city of blind time change 'cause I think that's an alternate ditched his name there but I'd say there's two reasons why respectfully I Would completely disagree with his position\nThe first one is that he said that Gandhi has nothing to do with Africa in fact a cause for having spent large parts of his life in South Africa\nAcross the whole of Africa in Kenya in South Africa and elsewhere Indian communities would deeply involved with liberation movements the African National Congress across very closely involved with the Indian National Congress which for independence to India\nAnd remembering the liberation was cosmopolitan existed across confidence not just within Africa within India is very important and the second even more important reason is to do with non violent resistance that was gone these great contribution to independence movements the idea of maps\nNon violence in our current terribly violent era I think that's the contribution that's well worth making of course ... we had some reprehensible views when he was younger he moved complete it goes against those when he was older\nAnd rejected cost racism and so forth so understanding how figures developed means that they're not saying that human beings who deserve respect and gone the has much to say to Africa as great

mean I think you know I I hear the the points that are taken I think the the concerns across Malawi are um are valid again coming out of the colonial sort of an African is anti racist movement um but yes you're you're absolutely right that's that's\nWell world [noise] it's interesting isn't it though how one person can be viewed differently in two different places ten seconds each\n[noise] yeah I

nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture so what's going on here how can something that we know isn't true you still have an impact on the way we behave\nAnd to Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo whether these superstitious or a true to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nThink that they are building on psychological process sees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example who are always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being ... related that ends up\nAlways searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being ... related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense another example is\nThe way that she respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so it's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program on on those a bit of amusing about voodoo and um but producing those very cruelly brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was asked if I Would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it all just socializing with the bad outcome of anything but happening to them\nYou're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of the lake ness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connect\nWith the bad outcome of anything happening to them what you're\nDescribing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative ness are sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between two things that look so much alike and that is part of where the ... believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly in automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition and the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case\nSometimes that slow system recognizes the air it recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintains that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a fool to experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case sometimes that slow system recognizes the air it recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintain that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems might into writes we're going to do a thought experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three of ... on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep your envelope\nYou can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what do you go full\nYou should go for the two [laughter] there is no question here rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a ... this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade there aren't below and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one ...\nWhile I'm not going to really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice the between the intuition and and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and an sometimes the rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first in Jewish and system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that intuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not the right\nKind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems in our brain and an sometimes the rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first in Jewish and system just because just because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not a rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the costs of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the new do so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi rational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition that I see this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one\nThat's a big cost so I'd rather avoid that and not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying it\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining it as a possibility Jane Rice and the\nAre listening to crowd signs on the b._b._c.

make that petition\nDo you like it was the main reason why by the government and particularly the meanest on women's affairs has not been supportive\nOr has not signed a this initiative is because
