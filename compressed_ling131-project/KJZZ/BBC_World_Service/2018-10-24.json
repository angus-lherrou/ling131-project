campaigns be focusing should they be spending an online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government illegal studies through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television but I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution list\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters\nAnd so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists or what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because\nThat's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work it does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction and so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign\nYou know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early and campaigns so that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close\nIf it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last you know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to we're going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive districts in states\nShould expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next uh in the next ten days\nProfessor of government Mike friends

put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you I'm\nGoing wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way up and these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there were All right there's nothing wrong so it isn't effective treatment and many

should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments and the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on those therapies for that at the world society and Academy of medical sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself\nSo there were two different types of happened both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you like on the ... yes so they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go

used to have to throw it away if I was wiping account to but now I realize that actually this nothing\nNothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or when I touched been I don't need to rush away

and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent\nSo that was a good reduction because they've only use the ad for one week stuff they used it for longer it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a\nCognitive ability so they're not so rigid in their cognitive thinking anymore they're not so that you all they can

joints NASA project they don't have\nLakes per se but they have these attachments\nMechanisms that allowed them to create you know the script on their environment so we were using sort of two flavors here we have a gecko inspired and he said they were using for\nFor smooth surfaces such as class and a micro spines which are these little fish hook independently mounted on compliance ... that can grab onto rough surfaces\nWhat are the robots looked like\nThere are a hundred grams ... sort of in your hands and it looks pretty much like a an aerial vehicles a quad rotor sort of Fort propellers with some of these attachment mechanisms down below\nAnd it's a micro spines which are these little fish hooks independently mounted on compliance ... that can grab onto rough surfaces\nWhat are the robots look like\nThey're about a hundred grams it'll be fit sort of in your hands and it looks pretty much like a an aerial vehicle of a quad rotor sort of for propellers with some of these attachment mechanisms down below where on the side\nAnd a forceful winch so sort of his motor geared up to produce some high force and some of the versions also had wheels to provide for some more precise locomotion on the ground\nAnd it's because of the way they can cling onto surfaces isn't it that they can exist to load a fool's\nExactly yes yes so really the interesting part here was this combination of aerial locomotion you know these small aerial vehicles are very mobile they can fly over ... stern floors they can fit into crevices and things like that\nBut they're not very forceful they really have an excellent he loads that are out there saying wait till they can fire round with\nSo by latching onto their environments with these attachment mechanisms which is the secret sauce here they can generate these forces with their environments to to have up to about forty times their weight depending on the surface\nNot nearly as good an opening doors as humans did not an argument against them\nYet but not not as certain you know as quick and it's not as Dexter is but you know I think this is really a\nProof of concept that small aerial vehicles or might be a feasible solution for some of the tasks that we usually think that we have to use larger terrestrial robots for\nIs this the research route to go down in the future do you think essentially copying nature [noise]\nI wouldn't copy nature for nature sake you know there's the\nReally a proof of concept that small aerial vehicles or might be a feasible solution for some of the tasks that we usually think that we have

difference between bio mimicry and violence to ration so we don't want to Nick all of the features that nature has\nBecause it has to do a lot of things that are robots don't save our robots will have to\nReproduce and feed themselves and things like this but if you take some of the underlying principles it is a wonderful source of inspiration to sort of spur on some creativity and solutions that we might not have thought of as designers and uh yeah\nGet an outsider's perspective on how to design the system\nThat was do to your ...
