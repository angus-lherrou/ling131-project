professor of law a social activist and influential advocate to the idea of intersection Alex ... is it the group\nNot the individual the masses most in today's America can be crunch will joins me now from Philadelphia Welcome to how to cook thank you for having me\nLet me ask you this do you believe in the United in the United states of America that is a country where\nAll the citizens are equal under the law\nAnd share a sense of common purpose shared values do you believe in that\nIf you're asking me to I Believe in the ideal of equality shared values equal citizenship\nYes of course that is a part of the current tradition a of of of of western liberalism\nThat's not really the issue that we're facing now however it's a matter of whether the values that we profess actually have any reflection in what's happening or in the United states one of the things that was so disturbing about the cabin I hearing is just watching\nThe institution that is so important in maintaining those ideals basically being a over override with pot politics with\nUm impartial impartiality being rejected as a measurement of of a qualification for a judge so those of us who are really concerned about the distance between the ideals and the reality of American society are really distraught at this point over the direction that the country is going in\nRight and it's interesting to me that you immediately point to the\nOverride with pop politics with\nUm impartial impartiality being rejected as a measurement of of a qualification for a judge so those of us who are really concerned about the distance between the ideals and the reality of American society really distraught at this point over the direction that the country is going and\nRight and it's interesting to me that you immediately point to the the sort of toxic persists around the\nAppointment or the nomination procession appointment of of judge Brett Kavanaugh to become a justice of the Supreme Court ruled costs around the world watched that\nPlay out in Washington DC and there is there for a temptation to see that the Trump presidency with the ... nomination a whole host of other things too has innocence creates huge\nDivisions has sort of opened up moons that the one before but but that can't be true kind of I mean he he's perhaps Neal brutally exposed them but the preexisting well\nAnd I get the same issue not just from this conversation from your writing student you are angry euro angry about the way America works and and your view of of water is a patriarchal society oppressors groups including women and minorities is something that makes you angry but to change it you have\nTo you have to reach out beyond your own groups whether it be women or whether it be African Americans you know to build a winning coalition\nYou're going to go national and you've got to obviously you include man and you've got to include a a range of of ethnicity so how do you go about building booze coalitions that cooperation\nWell so I guess I have to roll back for a moment and just to just that as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing in my writing the whole point\nOf intersection analogy is to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are a state of values and object is um there are many applications an intersection alley across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms of discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of the coalition between anti racist and feminist was\nAllies are a state of values and objective um there are many applications of intersection Eli across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms of discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the ah claims that were made by Anita Hill\nI'm what I argue there was that there was a common history\nOf anti racism and feminism found and the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment at the very knowledge admit that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination was largely step forward by African American women plaintiffs\nWho are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into feminist\nShoulder is but but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights companies\nHave looked at the history of ... as you say the failure of times of over ... feminist to make common cause with the black ...\nI'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist road it's time to ... back into survival mode\nDue to the dumpster fire live Bora Bora feminist agenda\nAnd\nI mean I could just laying\nPeople who actually uh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss\nThe killer groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be with us on a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way you do you see that you can use your arguments new powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pulled groups\nWell many of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that\nThe civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was\nA multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences\nI think in fact uh the last a week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing suggest that many women are particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the present day how do you feel about Morocco bummer 'cause he's with the midterms coming up his reruns of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal\nSurprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the present day how do you feel about Iraq Obama because he's with the midterms coming up his reruns of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and they'll GB T Americans not as all known since I said I go\nVote from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to and be mindful of cause he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect Brock Obama actually walking rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWhat they can stop for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on a on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric\nUm that identifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nUm I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that was a minor\nI'm sort of difference um within a broader reality\nThat we are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he tried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania I'm In Michigan that were really important\nBut that was a minor I'm sort of a difference of within a broader reality\nThat we are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he tried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's a good reminder of the fact that this isn't an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections who what where in election season or the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nA ... democratic votes as he said clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the culture of liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale whites\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that again in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and on on group based politics it is a very complex a complex set of relationships and attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones they gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator um who was the first a Democrat or to the elected from Alabama in a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women as the wheels and the best\nIs African American women they're the ones that game the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator um who was the first and a Democrat or to be elected I'm from Alabama and a generation or they're black women all over the ballots so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women\nAs the wheels on the bus but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them if we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political mobile mobilize\nA coalition that's what we're looking for in this in this midterm election will see\nWe will indeed she can really crucial thank you very much for joining me now to\n\n[noise] distribution of BBC World service in the U.S has

Web created back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure has outgrown original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data\nAnd in particular data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily panic about assault someone else's harvesting that data particularly if they're getting a free service in return if it's a social platform or something else\nBut they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the confidence its emphasis architectural weakness\nWell you're seeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period\nYou have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants that our government wants that\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as

developed these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have this\nSo what the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens lead your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out is is is now kind of ... being posted\nAbsolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting

you're in danger if you share your data\nFrom a insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially

date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots\nYou know I did a quick search this morning and found one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally\n... percent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or to visit comments on line is that there is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger\nDid a quick search this morning and found one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally eighty\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll

further and heart in ... by their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIs extraordinary and then you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook these platforms into a physical community we'd be standing in a in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent of which would be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world kind of like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably don't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you are under another political commentator out there having that conversation and telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other or at least they think\nWell yeah I mean I ... when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or box or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat them do use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them\nThe way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and then normal people get involved and it picks up steam and

involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect id by a group of fake\nAccounts on social media\nAs you say the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out there and take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that would be a very powerful statement to make as a media company\nBut it has and you'll have not yet buried under the new suggests a variety of on says to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like ... trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet I think one of the\nReasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with ... pretty pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of a block change is that every person has a node right and that no drop his answer identity but all of those new are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized the time there's no children I Do\nBut it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different note and therefore\nWatching is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all those notes

you can't delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we can at least improve the architecture the social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic that this is going to ... that we have a way through because ultimately we will go to live with the Internet is not going to go away we invented\nCan me I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where\nI think we've outgrown architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do what it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I'm absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic berets
