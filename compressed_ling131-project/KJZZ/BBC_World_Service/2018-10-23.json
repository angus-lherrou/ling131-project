blue ... who is ... ... puff scientific advisor and an urologist the\nEssence of Parkinson's disease is that the so called automatic pilot\nUm is defective if people with Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures the paying attention to it that automatic obesity is lost and people with Parkinson's\nBut you can actually literally trick the brain by by passing that automatic pilot which is more or less to start engine of the brain by consciously\nRecruiting demoted areas of the brain so what the lasers basically do is offer an external visual trigger forcing or allowing to patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they bypassed their defective automatic pointed\nRight okay I think I get this for people that have Parkinson's the automatic way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way\nYeah another really good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues will kept style as dust because the status going up which acts as a visual\nWill to my way of moving and walking which we

way it tricks the Brian ... constantly placing a cue\nAnd from out who as we heard a bit earlier has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets and railway stations this device is pretty useful\nIf I come down in the morning without the season\nNow can I can manage to says okay and then I get to the corner of the kitchen and I find it really difficult to stand up and to get my feet moving so\nI Will have to pull on my leg some holding like putting it around the corner or dragging myself along the the unit\nAnd then I get to the castle and I can't stand up straight to say let's say a lot in the capital and I'm guessing from the capital to the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then do you have to going to get the milk when I've forgotten to take it with me is also exhausting but with the shoes on it still hard what\nBut it makes it possible to do the things instead of ... impossible [noise]\n\n\nSounds like the ... and she's given have\nPeace of mind yet she told me broadly speaking she can now go to places like the supermarket with the knowledge that you can get out of a freezing I said if she knows it's going to happen\nHowever there are still

I Do cross quite badly and I I can I Can't predict when that's going to be there's nothing I can do except wait for the medication to was at the moment\nIn those situations even if she's got the shoes and by she called move on call ... the mom and she says era of limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven stuff is like the ... so that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the surfaces flat\nYeah I was going to ask about that\nI imagine a calm the very easy to see delays is on a sunny day\nYeah mounted mentioned to me that when she goes in ... in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she can't really see lasers on so that's one of the drawbacks and she felt a independents not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible outdoors\nSo it's not a perfect solution from out but it helps or do we know how well the ... other people with Parkinson's\nService study was done and it showed that the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants off medication and when they were on medication the effect was still positive it was the decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent\nHowever that was a really small sample size early Nineteen participants in a study\nThat small and I wonder how do these you know do they make you send out do you do a lot of attention to
