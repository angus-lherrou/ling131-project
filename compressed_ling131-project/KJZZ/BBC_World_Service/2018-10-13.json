third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David Keith backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally to do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other\nStuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end the atmosphere is one big heat edge and it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most a\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third if ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant but it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins is\nOn only about a third if ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequences at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nJust a patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the when some might be old said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't give a cooling effect of the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is it night yes how much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit if it's weak king but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region where large wind farms are seem to be warm\nWe're on the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then\nThe biggest effect is it night yes\nHow much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit if it's weak king but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region where large wind farms are seem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that but the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so when turbines are immensely better than coal and we have\nTo be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we did carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one wouldn't phone on a global scale items supposed to have a big event you'll modeling is ... numbers of wind farms\nYeah but one wind farm doesn't have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs not just true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very into intestinal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduced as climate change over the whole next century over the whole world\nThat one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs this just slightly dented the benefits of wind farms are what you know it's all together\nDon't think he wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution impacts\nAnd given the very long time scale of us have to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community began to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density\nIt also has huge air pollution in packs and given the very long time scale of us have to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community began to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density as of winter on race basically how much power you get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts ... kilometer\nWe've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number it's more like a half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill not simple because I Know that you were very interested in solar power and believes that the ... ... square meat or you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more what's per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only some buff and would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you know have environmental and social impact\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power what have you and the big important are finding I think it's that the land footprint of so\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will have environmental and social impact\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you and that a big important are finding I think that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than a land footprint of win for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and he's climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new thoughts on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at these timeline on active duty Keith climate there's a link

while flying and then one thing we already knew about flies was that they have these specialized ... called ... and I'll tears are basically to fly equivalent of your inner ear but stay be alert system so they use them for balance\nAnd flies can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the hulk years real fly and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control tumbled through the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time someone did that experiment was in Seventeen fourteen I think but what we didn't know how the whole chairs actually worked though what information where the whole chairs providing the fly\nSo in order to figure that out what I did was to record from the whole chair neurons\nAnd I found that the timing of single spikes was different when I recorded the hulk here near in a position that stimulated straight flight versus when I recorded while the health care was in a position\nThat simulated a fly rotating so basically my data showed that flies can tell the difference between stable flight and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of the spikes coming from their hall cheering her on\nWhat they're targeting as well because they have the ability to go over at the same joined the girls who were quick anyway\nYeah so these central Oregon they're more reflective there on the canals sensations of that sort of how you feel as opposed to vision and the reason they use these are there more reflective behaviors is because it's much faster than fish

because this research has shown away that complex aspect of an animal's environment can be broken down to the timing of a single spike\nSo this is our brains initially represent information in the world the truth single spikes anything on there on every thought an experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons Pfizer no different just easier to study fly because they have a lot fewer neurons than a human what [laughter]\nWhat will it mean for for humans information\nWider than human neurons work exactly the same way\nSo it certainly helps us to understand how different organism sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nBut there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example would be flight technology wise it had millions of years to evolve fast and efficient mechanisms for flying so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same techniques to build our own bio inspired

of this week's IPC the reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the world's on track to teach anything like that target festival\nTo clarify the report doesn't call for emitting the report also is a question that the government has asked the hype if you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen independence agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level and governments wanted to know what a difference wants between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible\nTo limit warm into one point five and now this report clearly shows that there is an important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich\nThe Paris Agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between warming off one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd say just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to build is not on track currently the pledges of the countries that they have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions over time until twenty thirty whereas in mission should be decreasing very very steeply a by twenty thirty\nSaid painted the picture wall or the consequences of temperature is rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nEasy now it's like I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to buy specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is ... is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody

one in which people living standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in the sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand and\nFive to ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an equate long term Cleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase to the next you see the price is that you can't another country and in other

that you can't another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no ... says what we can say is that\nThese losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term losses but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors\nThat we're seeing it may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get these short\nTerm ... cases if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the terms and we're seeing massive increase in the months of renewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nIs there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um well I like\nTo sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the generation we're seeing massive increasing the amount of\nVehicles that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar say we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on a sustainable finance area we can say the\n... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with a one point five Paris target for example I can see that now and the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for they say look ahead and they imagine a world that he is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it just went to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one we should not see\nThis as a luxury something that we do now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nDoes this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay for future climate impact if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd read to degree are forming this is not in the far future this is um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty\nBalance this with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd ... to a degree of warming due to smoke in the far future does this um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so does this reading not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to eat carefully managing managed showed up they shoot the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie wants\nTo come back and yeah I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a Ninety nine countries with renewable feeding tired Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are the how the other places to stop the renewable and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly cities is making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance has agreed no but I Do is that what do we need and\nI mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize that there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've\nHad is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being more expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investment changing it is changing\nGoes high is working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications and countries indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing is not enough\nAs they say the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this point that he's made all their report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not heard it's not just necessary for ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need\nBoth you know so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember the\nGlobal economy is not stuffing and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty surgeon down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double\nNinety Chilean will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at a ... rates of about three percent of the year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the

likely to double in the next four years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities the dock congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nOr we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this how fast now thank you to our

the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for a think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoints\nAdministration still didn't actually except the science that's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nation just level but\nI mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the say can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's as David said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't is not lost\nThink there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believed to science and the abuses science to argue for the fact of use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that little warming is happening\nThose effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the

use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in\nThe United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line and South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government her signed up to\nSee how but how do you decide your date and of course that tree howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from power as there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it's cheaper to generate power from other ... shots shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and which is an old\nAbout the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industry and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record the storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's sea level rise is a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the goals were partly ... because of climate change I think people would say it's\nAn increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress in the u._s. hasn't gone with this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know kind of an energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase\nWith this has been in the support for innovation low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to see her all at the route investments that three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies but Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... that a growing I won't speak to treat the group that he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo joy I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that is growing\nFast but also a country that has taken\nIts climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to uh some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it sort of\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda is much more to talk about\nRenewables but at the same that made me just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is\nMuch more to talk about renewables but at the same that made me just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help\nAnd so uh that it's a good reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you like caused\nThe problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries are doing the north must take action cyst\nNo it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the old tried to convince a bench and funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going\nThey're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north you'll be
