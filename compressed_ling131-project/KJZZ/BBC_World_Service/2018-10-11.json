SpaceX rocket kind of Sudan spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of the costs of the overall mission so he's he's few really good deliverable everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tug that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in any permanently in space and it'll it'll be that shuttle and that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you'll feel that shuttled from the surface of the earth but maybe when that shuttle gets out to geosynchronous orbit or farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids\nAnd you're going to need a ... colony first I mean or at least an an active sort of industry on a ... a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nThis is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that sustainably gets this\nMoon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids\nAnd you're going to need to call them the funnest I mean or at least ... and actually from sort of industry on a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that sustainable you get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects or their multibillion dollar projects decades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for a hundreds of billions of not trillions\nOf dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers at of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that\nQuick question if you you go you've got your asteroid and you'll sites and you go up and you land on it to respect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we wanted to do and the luge besides but it hasn't gone by then and there's not going to be back for several\nDecades now that is one of the challenges of working with asteroids as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining we see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons\nSo with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for how soon will this happen\nIt's happening now you know you're going to have a pro bono starting to prospect on that particular restaurant the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions the commercial sector\nOf their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for how soon will this happen\nIt's happening now you know you're going to have a ... starting to prospect on that particular restaurant the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions\nThe commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nBut five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and you think the finances that yes absolutely hundred million dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale mind\nChristmas here on business daily from the BBC\nLiving we discuss space tourists space factories mining even automated space refuse collection but where's the magic and all of this\nMan the space colonies from the people for example the kind that entrepreneurial must ... looms adjusted we should be building a mosque well the truth is according to Ariel ex law there are many many problems to having humans living alone tub in space\nIs one of the questions that we need to solve the humanity which is how can our

joins me now and of course I'm oversimplifying crazily really but this is about black holes having heats which means he dissipates black holes might disappear what happens to be objects\nAnd that's exactly what it's about we're trying to find\nA resolution to this problem and called information powder which is something that Stephen Hawking has been um really obsessed with the last forty years we'll say on this program as essentially as you said what happens objects when they fall into a black hole where does the information about these objects guys\nAnd usually we think that from the outside you can't tell anything about what's inside the black hole and they want something flew into a black hole all information about that passed last forever and what we've been trying to do is to trace this information and find a way of recovering this information\nAnd how how far have you\nWell we're not definitely not that we we we want to step forward I'd say we've shown that and so there's a way of describing organization in a black hole and that's called entropy and we've shown that there was a way that we can say this entropy\nAnd but this is this is just one step along the road\nAnd what's next that because I spoke to my next question is can you go further with I watch that remarkable brain\nWell it's I mean it's going to be difficult even had a remarkable intuition and amazing inside and he would often and\nSort of tell us just in one sentence something he thought it was ... would be the case of what's going to happen and we don't get confused for a while and then you know among place that he would try not to be right and\nIt was just so useful having somebody has some amazing and\nI mean it's going to be difficult Steven hat and a multiple intuition and amazing inside and he would often and sort of kind of just in one sentence something he thought it was it would be the case of what's going to happen and we'd also confused for a while and then you know among the ... on the right and\nIt was just so used to having somebody has some amazing and intuition about how things should walk says it will ... it's definitely gonna be different different and more difficult without him but wet abstain he's still going to try the next step really is to try and walk out\nAnd if we can recover how much of the information we can recover and if this description and all the information products could possibly and actually it was all this problem and if we could recover order the information that's in a black hole\nAnd this is not just about a theory is it we're learning so much in this exploration about where we all go anywhere on a planet where a universe is going\n[noise] yes I mean ... the black holes wake considering all all real and that ... that sort of after physical black holes and so they really relate to and the universe and how and things interacting with black holes and things interacting the universe is\nSuch a really interesting to meet you and thank you so much for explaining that circulated ... who's called for one of the co authors of the paper with Stephen Hawking a which is called black hole entropy and software I didn't ask a quick claim softer soft hair is one of those things that you see around black holes apparently it's not have obviously\nHave a look at it if you can find that on line the United kingdom is hosting an
