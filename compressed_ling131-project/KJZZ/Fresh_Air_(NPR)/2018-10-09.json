I think what it said what we've seen so far and we saw this a little bit ah going into a last\nWeek and then sort of the polling coming out of last week that it's motivated Republican men\nAre I think what we're seeing with regard to women again college educated white women who had previously been with the president and with the Republican Party\nAlready over the summer we're starting to move toward leaning towards democratic candidates and if you look at some of the data coming out of last week it appears that that\nHas not changed so the climate still favors Democrats but I think what you have seen is and I think it's hard to know how much of this is is a cabinet and how much of this is the fact that it is\nYou know getting closer and closer tightening in or and people are starting to pay more attention when we're also seeing Republicans are actually become more energized and motivated up more broadly so I think we still you know such a volatile electorate and I think it's a little bit difficult to\nTease out exactly what's causing which\nOkay so there's a new CNN poll that shows that the President Trump's approval rating among women\nThe way I should say disapproval among women for President Trump is sixty two percent and this is a an a number that's coming on the heels of poll last week showing a huge gender gap\nUm for the Republican for the Republican Party am I wrong to think that what is happening here between\nThan in Trump's approval rating among women the way I should say disapproval among women for President Trump is that sixty two percent and this is a an a number that's coming on the heels of poll last week showing a huge gender gap\nUm for the Republican for the Republican Party\nAm I wrong to think that what is happening here between the victory lap in the East Room of the White House earlier earlier this evening\nI'm Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell sort of saying that this has all been very good very good for the base that they're trying to trying to make us believe something that actually isn't happening\nI think that's I think that's absolutely possible you know I'll tell you Jonathan as you also as you know I also serve on the board of ... pro Choice America\nAnd as you know one of the can we that organization we've been thrown out front\nA leading the charge against ah the cabinet nomination and one of the things that we've seen in a number of races is a you know women are increasingly concerned about what will happen to roe v Wade and that is\nWe saw earlier in the summer in some instances in in governors' races you had voters saying particularly women voters saying they would want a governor who would protect roe versus Wade if there was a change on the court\nSo one of the things that we've just launched is an initiative to educate people on the possibility that abortion could be criminalized we've also a narrow alleys just also launched a million dollar targeted TV and digital advertising campaign in specific races\nSo I think I think you're right in that McConnell is trying to make it so which is that you know something we see if if sometimes where it'll try to say it to make it so\nBut uh I think again I think women are\nPossibility that abortion could be criminalized we've also a narrow is just also launched\nA million dollar targeted TV and a digital advertising campaign and specific races\nSo I think I think you're right in that McConnell is trying to make it so which is that you know something we see if if sometimes where it'll try to say it to make it so but uh I think again I think women are very motivated and they're motivated around understanding what the stakes are in the mix I think in this\nMid term election feels a lot higher than it has been in previous elections mid term elections so\nChristian ... your ... go ahead but I also want to jump up something parents that is is McConnell ... said he was trying to say it to make it so uh do you agree with that is that how you view it from your vantage point\nI don't think that this is just ... is just spin coming from folks like Mitch McConnell I think they really believe this is\nYou know in a year where we were seeing ... prior to uh the last couple of weeks you know a pretty significant advantage for Democrats in terms of voter enthusiasm seeing that gap clothes\nI don't think it's just been for four Republican leaders to say hey has this been the thing that has helped close that gap I I Do think the political environment is different from\nThat the national level versus some of these key Senate states which is another reason why I think Mitch McConnell has some reason to be a you know more upbeat about the political fortunes 'em spilling over from this this confirmation story\nA who's going to join us from Miami to talk about Florida politics and more from you on the question was do you want in a candidate someone who fights hard and take the prisoners or someone who was fires and tries to unite us\nOr can you be both according to Christian and care and you can but what do you think call us at ... for for seven four or five eight to five five you're listening to

Anderson and democratic strategist Karen Finney\nWe were talking about a rage uh raised as a result of the Kavanaugh\nA confirmation process and swearing in the comments from the president of both this morning and just earlier this evening a during the ... the second swearing in 'em down justice Kavanaugh\nAnd I want to get more into um women's rage at\nThis point and senator Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a address the issue of whether she was angry about what was happening here's what she said\nI Am angry [noise]\nAnd angry women sit down and shut out\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or address the issue of whether she was angry about what was happening here's what she said\nI Am angry [noise]\nAnd angry when I sat down and shut out one [noise]\nShe goes on to say I am angry because of everyone who has lost power a junk mail and I'm going to bring in I'm Kristin and caring into this the the women's raised the anger of women in around the country over what happened\nTo Dr Christine Blasey Ford in this confirmation process the response of now justice\nBrett Kavanaugh ... if you listen to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell or even the president there the rage that is being expressed felt and expressed by women is immaterial if not ignored\nMhm well the thing is you're you have to understand that\nDonald Trump and the Republican Party have successfully weaponized victimization\nAnd that they have made it a commodity to on which to market themselves they said that I'm going to make you feel like you have something to be mad about even if you are in fact part of a privileged class\nAnd if in fact you are see white person in West Virginia or any number of these states that have you know\nPoor schools in low paying jobs are no jobs um we're going to give you somebody to blame for that and so\nThat that fact is inextricably from this debate about anger and rage uh you have to we have to understand that there are a lot of folks who\nIf in fact you are see white person in West Virginia or any number of these states that have you know poor schools and low paying jobs are no jobs um we're going to give you somebody to blame for that and so\nThat that fact is inextricably from this debate about anger and rage uh you have to we have to understand that\nThere are a lot of folks who have been angry for very very long time and find very good reason to be and it is in the interest of Trump and McConnell to ignore them it's not something that they simply do or because maybe they're ... or because they really behind Brett Kavanaugh and they went to see their conservative goals reached\nThey have a a real reason to ignore the people that are coming out to them and I think it's really convenient way of of of the legitimate causing a your your opponent rather than actually having to deal with what they're saying Chris and what do you make of what your meal just said\nBut still I think that right now and I I don't want to take credit for this insight it was one of those things I saw on Twitter and and I actually thought that it was it intelligently phrase but it was that\nRight now you have I think in both parties a feeling of sort of victimization that derives from the really big in balance in power that both sides of the political spectrum have in terms of political indoor cultural power the idea that that the right\nHas control as Karen mentioned earlier in the show of the White House Congress now the Supreme Court and yet has very little power and the cultural arenas in the U.S the political conservatives feel like\nI Can't say merry Christmas without coming under fire you know the late I Can't turn on late night comedy without you know feeling like my way of life is under threat I feel like a stranger and my own country similarly for Democrats and they they enjoy it I think quite a bit of sort of\nA power in the cultural realm and that where Americans moving culturally is quite in line ... ...\nEvery little power and the cultural arenas in the U.S the political conservatives feel like I Can't say merry Christmas without coming under fire you know the late I Can't turn on late night comedy without you know feeling like my way of life is under threat I feel like a stranger in my own country similarly for Democrats and they they enjoy I think quite a bit of sort of\nA power in the cultural realm on that where America's moving culturally is quite in line more in line with where they're at and yet that's not reflected in the political reality in the sense that hey we make up this huge portion of America and yet we feel like our voices are being hurt in the political arena\nCurrents which that imbalance oh sorry so I was just conceded that imbalance that lead to both parties to feel like\nThey are not they do not have the voice they deserve\nWell I think there's a couple of things we need to separate out here right on the one hand with women because remember [noise]\nExcuse me I have a cold we've seen women are running for ... before Kavanaugh's before the Supreme Court we saw women running for office at record numbers\nTurning out and making a difference in a special elections in twenty Seventeen and earlier and twenty Eighteen in record numbers particularly black women right\nSo I don't want us to get to a place where we're ... slating what's happening now in the rage and the anger that women are expressing with something that was already happening which was an expression I think more of women saying okay\nI'm going to put my hat in the ring and I'm going to step up and I'm going to I'm going to do this I'm going to run for office right I I I don't think the changes that I Believe need to be happening are happening what I think is is happening now though is this very searing moment\nAnd then it really you know the meat you moment and now we just you know what we've experienced in the last\nWeek it really it crosses race\nHi it's Phil Latzman thank you for listening to cages easy on my service which is supported by ... education foundations are proud sponsor of the cage ACC education desk he Leo's education foundation believes every student regardless of ZIP Code deserves a high quality education\nWind up ... dot org\nIt crosses race it crosses a you know a ... parts of the country it crosses party lines in terms of Mac cannot tell you how many women that I Know from ... all kinds of backgrounds who have just been so what we say triggered\nBy you know listening to Dr Ford because too many of us as women myself included have too many experiences that are similar it and it ranges all the way from um you know harassment to assault\nUm and just that feeling of powerlessness um I think it is part of what is now driving a a a rage and an anger that women feel\nSimilar to kind of what we saw in Nineteen Ninety two where ... where we were the feeling was hey we need more women in office because we're the ones who are going to bring about the change\nUh that changes that we need it's unfortunate therefore than it was a woman who kinda stabbed us on the back that's another story in the cabinet vote\nSo I I think there are some different things and this is all happening against the backdrop of as we know from the twenty sixteen election a growing cultural anxiety or in this country between you know as the country becomes more diverse\nUm as women continue to rise in the ranks although we still haven't quite gotten there and particularly black women so\nI I think there are some different things and this is all happening against the backdrop of as\nWe know from the twenty sixteen election a growing cultural anxiety ah in this country between you know as the country becomes more diverse um as women continue to rise in the ranks although we still haven't quite gotten there and particularly black women\nSo I just think there's a number of different forces that are kind of\nComing together at the same time that are impacting\nYou know why women are feeling more motivated both to run for office to get out and vote a and I and the numbers that we're seeing that I think well actually turned out and vote and make the difference in a number of elections\nWhy if there are women out there who are who are listening who as a result of what's happened in happened over the weekend and certainly over the last few weeks uh with with Kavanaugh ... you are so angry that you are more motivated today than you were a couple of weeks ago give us a call it for for seven four or five eight to five

written a very different kind of American history the book is called these truth and I spoke to her during the peak of the historic drama surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\n... welcome to America on the line\nHey thanks so much for having me\nYou write in your book that the American experiment rests on three political ideas politically quality natural rights and sovereignty of the people how's that working out\n[laughter] well that is the question and one of the arguments I make in the book is that that was an experiment right these truth or self evident in court in the declaration of independence but they are meant to be the subject of continuous inquiry that the\nUnwritten statement of the declaration of independence nations also founded on the spirit of inquiry so that is actually the question we're supposed to keep asking ourselves how is that working out so that we can make adjustments yeah so that we can reform or revised or amend or\nCommit revolution whatever it is that is required if we believe those choose to be the ones on which are good government should rest\nSo these shrewd this which I'm In a way it's a bowl title because arguably whether these days we hold any troops to be self evident but you would argue that it's not just the current political and social climate and this is an ongoing struggle in America\nSure I mean it's a long standing struggle in the United states to realize the promise of the nation's founding ideals that broader pissed I'm a logical crisis like how does anyone know what\nWhether these days we hold any truth to be self evident but you would argue that it's not just the current political and social climate and this is an ongoing struggle in America\nSure I mean it's a long standing struggle in the United states to realize the promise of the nation's founding ideals\nThe broader pissed I'm a logical crisis like how does anyone know what they know anymore that's not an American thing that has a particular manifestation and our political arrangements since we live in a democracy in which citizens in order to cast reasonable valid ballots have to have sufficient information\nTo make a good decision and whether we can or cannot do that any longer is I think a a big question\nThis history begins with Columbus his voyage and fourteen Ninety two which may seem at first like a history of the Americans but rarely as are beginning point of us history why did you choose Columbus as your starting\nPoint yeah so I'm One of the things I wanted to do and writing this book was try to a cross the divide and that divide in terms of how we understand the American past\nIs between a a very traditional kind of great man theory of American history\nThat in fact traditionally begins in this weird fictitious way with Columbus as if he's an ancestor ah and then kind of hops from great man to a great man to great man all the way down to the president mainly up to the present mainly stopping at presidents\nAnd a kind of counter tradition which is the sort of social history and history of political movements in of conflict among groups\nA that's a history that more conventionally now would begin with the indigenous peoples of America going back a several centuries if not millennia\nTo chronicle a the people in the Americas from Asia and then would\nHe stopping at presidents and a kind of counter tradition which is the sort of social history and history of political movements in a conflict among groups a that's a history that more conventionally now would begin with the indigenous peoples of America going back a several centuries if not millennia\nTo chronicle a the people in the Americas from Asia and then would you know proceed in would sort of set Columbus to one side he might enters a minor character and the whole store would be sort of about um the the experiences of a different groups in conflict with other groups right\nIdeologically those two very different histories roughly do map on to our political\nPositions right the one is quite conservative telling of the American story and the other is is the progressive or liberal telling of the American story ... ... I think it actually is a huge problem to have such a polarized passed right like that you can't move forward a\nFrom a position of polarization when you can't even talk about a common shared passed in any meaningful way so I don't subscribe to like\nColumbus the great discovered narrative um\nBut I Begin with Columbus because I think for a lot of readers that is that's where they're expecting story to begin\nAnd then I pull away from that to ask like how do we ... what do we know about Columbus and what do we know about the people that he met and how well how do we understand asymmetry of historical record what does it mean what our obligations to people who lived and died when some people left written records that we now have survived\nAnd other people's entire cultural history was destroyed willfully\nAre and how do we reckon with that 'cause 'cause all of those people are ... they're equally ancestors there is no lesser version of who is an ancestor of\nYou know what becomes the United states so I'm trying to kind of\nMix those things up and actually demand\nWhen some people left written records that we need to have survived and other people's entire cultural history was destroyed willfully are and how do we reckon with that 'cause 'cause all of those people are and they're equally ancestors there is no lesser version of who is an ancestor of\nYou know what becomes the United states so I'm trying to kind of\nMix those things up and actually demand of the reader thinking about why why these two explanations both have a explanatory force you\nWrite 'em in these troops as a very compelling um paragraph you write a nation born and revolution bull forever struggle against chaos\nAnd inefficient born in contradiction liberty in a land of slavery sovereignty in a land of conquest will fight for ever over the meaning of its history\nIt this jumped out at me particularly because of the time that we're in now in this make a make America great again\nA time that we have as the mantra of President Trump [noise]\nYeah and if you look at recent political movements\nAnd certainly presidential campaigns they are all we do simple or their reductive is essentially historical arguments make America great again is a historical argument it's an arguing about the relationship between the past and the future rate so\nWas Obama's change you can believe in it is it is an argument about the relationship between the president and the future we have um\nYou know about you know famously said in his first inaugural we must choose are better history\nA there how we can figure ourselves politically is very much in conversation with our past\nAnd I think that's important and that is a a a part of how any people understand themselves but when the past\nIs it is an argument about the relationship between the president and the future we have um you know Obama you know famously said in his first inaugural we must choose are better history a there how we can figure ourselves politically is very much in conversation with our past\nAnd I think that's important and that is a a a part of how any people understand themselves but when the past is just simply used as a cudgel to sort of hit the other your political opponent\nDone that I think contributes to our political ... equilibrium or you could have ended\nOn so you start with Columbus and you could have ended on\nPresident Obama and the election of ... of President Obama which I'm a lot of people no matter their political persuasion would see that as an exclamation point on the experiment that is America's history but you didn't you go right on the right on through why\nYeah I had always planned on ending on inauguration day in two thousand nine it's a beautiful scene it's completely compelling kind of drama courage ugly\nAnd since the book is insists on understanding a racial politics in front of the presidential politics like social movements and civil rights alongside\nThe development of parties at the book is really committed to integrating stories of American history instead of having like the march of the president's on one side to side bars about Jim Crow where something book really is
