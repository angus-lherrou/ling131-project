T. L.\nSo about that nightmare scenario I mentioned earlier now what if\nThe election really isn't over next Tuesday night what if there are so many disputed results ballot challenges runoffs and slow vote counts that were left with a cliffhanger\nIt happens take the Norm Coleman al Franken's Senate race in Minnesota in November two thousand eight that election wasn't decided until\nJune thirtieth two thousand nine after every available court challenge was exhausted what should we be bracing for this time joining me from Washington is David Wasserman editor at cook Political Report and from Phoenix welcome back to have post senior political reporter Kevin robot lard\nKevin Dave both of you welcome back to America on the line\nJonathan [noise]\nHave you back uh Dave let me start with you how likely is any permutations of the nightmare scenarios I laid out likely to happen\nFor for it's it's certainly possible that we could emerge from election night not knowing it controls the house I think Democrats are a strong favorite for house control maybe Seventy to eighty percent odds but not a good night for Republicans\nGregory back I David let me start with you how likely is any permutations of the nightmare scenarios I laid out likely to happen\nWell it's it's certainly possible that we could emerge from election night not knowing who control the house I think Democrats are a strong favorite for house control maybe Seventy to eighty percent odd but\nNot a good night for Republicans ten wishing to carry out that fat or Democrats or or certainly again seems to have that on on the least worst night for a Republican or there could be some question as to uh several races that are very close a on the east coast in the mid west but also\nSeveral races that might not be settled in California for several\nWeeks ... love California slow vote counts because it at the drama but that might be a nightmare for party strategist who want to know\nWho the speaker will bear party strategist how millions of Americans who want a definitive answer a election night so I'm using them anticipated what I was going to ask you in terms of\nOf ... voting where we're could we see slow voting happened California is notorious are there other parts of the country or other states were slow voting is just something that happens every two to four years\nSo it's not slow voting slow vote to slow down yes or no\nTakes about a month to finalize a all of it's a male and vote returns and often times more than half of the vote is counted up beyond a the election day so it takes a long time to determine factors and typically Democrats do better\nIn the votes that are counted after election day so even if they're trailing in a handful of braces final election night there or they could make up that\nGap Washington state is another place to look out for 'em and Kevin ...\nThe returns and often times more than half of the vote is counted up beyond a the election day takes a long time to determine factors and typically Democrats to fatter\nAnd in the votes are counted after election day cigarettes are trailing at a handful of braces fine election night there or they could make up that gap Washington state is another place to look out for\n'em and Kevin one of the nightmare scenarios Iran ... was a run off ... what are the conditions that lead to a runoff in of course I'm thinking of Georgia and Mississippi start with Mississippi so Mississippi Israeli where we would\nHave sort of a nightmare scenario in this case we wouldn't know who ends up with control of the United States Senate ah\nDave's nightmare scenario sort of relied on a very good night for Republicans are relatively good night for Republicans there's no real way Republicans have been very good night and the house or this or to rely on a pretty good very good night for Democrats and when it comes to the Senate\nIf Democrats are able to pick up maybe one seat and sort of hold onto their others\nControl of the Senate could come down to a runoff in Mississippi likely between the Democratic candidate there who is a former congressman and agriculture secretary and Mike asked me and Mississippi is a incumbent senator a Cindy Hyde Smith\nThat wouldn't be decided until December that could be a real nightmare and knowing who control the Senate you'd also likely see just a ton of money and resources from\nBoth political parties poured into that state in an effort to determine control of the United States Senate or that said it is sort of an unlikely scenario again because it would run bubble really really good night for Democrats ... that just doesn't look possible considering how Republican tilted the Senate map is\nIn Georgia you could see one of the most contested um governor's races\nFrom both political parties poured into that state in an effort to determine control of the United States Senate or that said it is sort of an unlikely scenario again because it would run bubble really really good night for Democrats ... that just doesn't look hospital considering how Republican tilted the Senate map as\nIn Georgia you could see one of the most contested um governors' races go to a runoff that's between Democrats Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp um if neither one of them breaks fifty percent on election night that ... that race will go to our off\nAnd let me bring you back to to Mississippi one second before turning at my intention to to Georgia ... the race in Mississippi I'm Mike Espy versus the income than a ... this is a big deal because Mike Espy the Democratic um candidate\nHe shouldn't even be competitive in is in a red state like Mississippi no [laughter]\nYeah it's it's a really interesting scenario um for all this to come up basically what happened is when a Republican senator Thad Cochran resigned earlier this year he triggered a special election which takes place under some\nSort of different rules than a typical a Senate election what in Mississippi part of that is including the runoff another part of that is that actually on the ballot there's no party registration listed\nSo none of these candidates under Mike as we've name it does not say Democrats under Cindy Hyde Smith name it does not say Republicans\nThat really could end up making a different depending on how things break down\nThe reason this is likely to go to a runoff is because Cindy Hyde Smith is also facing a challenge from within her own party from state senator Chris McDaniel he has sort of an arch conservative he was one of sort of Steve Bannon's warriors who do you remember back at the beginning of the Senate cycle we talk a lot about how\nThen it does not say Republicans that really could end up making a different depending on how things break down\nThe reason this is likely to go to a runoff is because Cindy Hyde Smith is also facing a challenge from within her own party\nFrom state senator Chris McDaniel he has sort of an arch conservative he was one of sort of Steve Bannon's warriors who you remember back at the beginning of the Senate cycle we talk a lot about how bad it was going to try to run challengers to all these incumbent Republican\nDaniel was going to be one of those challengers he hasn't really raised the money that he expected to at this point it looks pretty safe based on pulling that asked me and hide Smith will it back to the runoff but he's going to take away enough of the vote from Hyde Smith to make sure that neither candidate caps or fifty percent\nOkay now now George and you laid out the possibility of a of a run off their one of the things that was we were talking about\nA time all sort of blends together Kevin I don't know if it was last week or the week before where we were talking about the situation in Georgia with the um\nUh registrations that were being held fifty three thousand\nA voter registrations that were on hold and one of the things that came out was that whether you're a registration is on hold or not show up at the poll\nAnd polls and file a provisional ballot so talk about the difference between a provisional ballot and standard ballet and how that I'm comes into play in terms of\nVote counting and whether we will we will that will add to the suspense\nOr in Georgia and the Georgia governor's race\nSo this could add to the suspense of whether they wouldn't even be a runoff riding on what happens here so religion about is basically used when there's some question about whether or not a voters ultimately vote 'em and virtually all states under sort of the help America vote act which was passed back in two thousand two after the\nWe will that will add to the suspense\nOr in Georgia and the Georgia governor's race yeah so this\nCould add to the suspense of whether they wouldn't even be a runoff riding on what happens here so religion about is basically used when there's some question about whether or not a voter is all about 'em\nAnd virtually all states under sort of the help America vote act which was passed back in two thousand two after the recount in the presidential election in Florida um the voter can cast a provisional ballot or almost all the time\nSo it very sort of under what conditions you would cast one and the thing is many of these ballots can be a challenge in some places it's contingent upon the boat or to provide proof that they are relatable to post sort of after the fact\nSo there's really lots of complicated way and uh that this happens it's very easy to sneak in a situation in Georgia where there's a lot of questions about how camp is handling this election because he is also the secretary's day the state's chief elections officer\nIt'd be very easy to imagine a scenario where there's lots of provisional ballots cast perhaps\nAnd perhaps lots of challenges to ride\nA so when we started the show I asked listeners to call in to say whether they would be voting their fears this election day in six days or their hopes eight four four seven four or five eight to five five and mark calling from Missouri\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\nMaybe you've lived in the valley for years for maybe you just got

Phoenix is huff post senior political editor Kevin ... let's get to some of the news of this day Robert Bowers was charged\nAny forty four count federal indictment of the murders of eleven Jewish worshippers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh they are labeled as hate crimes um\nThis is interesting whereas the rest of my stuff I had more news here that I\nRun over the goes to you know oh you know I you know at Marie I'm I I Can't even read my own my own writing because it says it right here this evening President Trump's prepared to than even more troops to the southern border to block migrants from central\nUm [noise] you know this is interesting where's the rest of my stuff I had more news here that I run over we [laughter] the ghosts took it [laughter] you know [laughter] oh you know I you know at Marie I'm I'm I Can't even read my on my own writing because it says it right here this evening President Trump's prepared\nTo than even more troops to the southern border to block migrants from Central America from entering the United states listen to what he had to say\nWe have about five thousand a field office anywhere between benefit the very first show on top of border patrol and everybody else in the water nobody Dominguez\nGotta love life radio and federal judges in Cincinnati today ordered Ohio to allow formerly purge voters to vote in this year's election\nThey had been purged for not voting over a six year period the state will not fight the order so Maria and Kevin I went to um start this conversation by talking about\nUm [noise] the president this idea of sending ten thousand troops to the the southern border I'm In anticipation of\nThe Central American migrants from Central America\nApproaching the United states won a ... we have discussed the legality of this and everything I Want to talk about the the the politics of this because\nEven though last week late last week we're talking about the legality of all of this he's still talking about it and politically I Want to know for both of you particularly you I'm Kevin 'cause you're a there in Arizona\nWhy is the president still talking about\nThis I mean he thinks it's a winning issue for um\n[noise] I don't think it's real\nLast week late last week we're talking about the legality of all of this he's still talking about it and politically I Want to know for both of you particularly you I'm Kevin 'cause you're I'm there in Arizona why is the president still talking about\nThis I mean he thinks it's a winning issue for um\nI don't think it's realistic for anyone to think that we need Fifteen thousand troops on the U.S Mexico border to deter this one caravan that I Believe remains thousands of miles away from the United states\nOr he thinks that immigration is the issue that best fires up his base a so he is going to talk about it whenever you can and this is a way for him to talk right away for him to show that he's taking it seriously you did not get the wall\nOr that he promised he would get Mexico is not going to pay for it they never wear and so he's trying to use this as a sort of alternative way to fire up his base a way to show that he is accomplishing something on immigration unless most Republican candidates are in throughout the country I'm\nParticularly the candidates for Senate are siding with it or Marsha Blackburn who's the Republican Senate candidate in Tennessee and Trump loyalists\nSaid that they've coming caravan wasn't in danger\nThat was very backward invasion and if you have an invasion it makes sense to send troops to fight it so that is clearly a the strategy he Thinks Works best for his political party particularly when it comes to the Senate races which are mostly being bought on read just a tainted or deep red territory\nRight and right now the president on this evening as we were coming on the air the president was leading a campaign rally there in Florida a on behalf of the Senate candidate Rick Scott in the gubernatorial candidate Ron Santas\nHi it's Phil Latzman thank you for listening to cages easy online service which is supported by ... education foundations are proud sponsor of the cage ACC education desk heels education foundation believes every student regardless of ZIP Code deserves a high quality education\n... dot org\nOr oh candidate Ron defenses and even in in that he talked about the quote unquote caravan um bloody I Would love your reaction to I'm hearing the President's Day is going to say Fifteen thousand troops\nI think that's more troops than we have in Iraq right now\nI'm ... I'm thinking actually about to morale I'm I tweeted this morning I said we are you know there will be black and brown people who speak English going to the border to keep black and brown people who speak Spanish from becoming black and brown people who speak English and Spanish\nHe's the only difference between the people who are going to be down at the border and those who are coming I'm you know the the few thousand people who were desperate\nUm is that they speak a different language but they basically you know they're gonna look alike and there are Latinos and African Americans in their majority will probably be at that border [noise]\nUm so it's a very strange site um but but I think it's it's also we have to keep it in context I'm very concerned about the way the mainstream media has kind of played this as a kind of a horse race I'm really kind of a again this whole thing on a narrative that that basically that that Trump has um has\nHas done created this is not an invasion this is not a massive amount of people flooding uncontrollably that is not true\nI'm pleased to keep it in context that the people of Central America as a whole are several million people [noise]\nI'm really kind of a again this whole thing on a narrative that that basically that that Trump has um has has done created this is not an invasion this is not a massive amount of people flooding uncontrollably that is not true\nI'm pleased to keep it in context that the people of Central America as a whole are several million people\nAnd these are maybe three thousand four thousand people at this point um that are the most desperate people the most absolutely desperate people\nWho thought that they could be protected by coming in this way because it's a dangerous missions in many ways they're making a smart decision by saying I'm not going to do this alone I'm going to go with others and yet they're being met you know with a huge political dynamic they I'm sure many of them were not even aware of\nUh before I turn to the fourteenth amendment I Do want to go back to to um the calls because I asked people to call in to on this Halloween to say if they're going to vote their fears or their hopes aid for for seven four or five eight to five five\nUm let's see we've got a call from New York and I'm calling from Ohio let's go to let's go right here in the borough of Manhattan here in New York City\nAnd pick up a ... a ... thanks for calling into America on the line says\nUm hello Hi I'm I'm Eliza mhm [noise]\nUm I'm twelve years old and I and my greatest fear for

emotional reaction to this like where does this come from like yeah\nWell I I'm I'm twelve I obviously don't get to vote 'em and I feel like\nOther people that are of the age to vote they should get that chance and get the chance to speak their mind and vote because in the two thousand six cheat election a lot of people didn't vote\nWhich means a lot of like this all like\nThis even if you don't think it does this concerns you like like your country this is your life this is your president and like you should get to choose\nAnd winds up I'm so in twenty sixteen when Donald Trump was elected

going to try to see if we can get Bob or ... or ... or find Bob uh but as you can hear radio host is here host of NPR's\nNPR's Latino USA and also joining us from Florida right now from Fort Myers Florida\nIs ... he was at\nThe rally in Fort Myers that President Trump just did a ... is is a huff post political reporter and as I said a going out of the last break the governor's race between Tallahassee mare Andrew Gillum and former Republican Congressman Ron defenses is one of the most watched campaigns\nAnd at the moment ah Andrew Gillum seems to be seems to be leading\nI'm a serious\nSince you wrote one welcome to America on the line [noise] and so since the rally adjuster just finished a bright getting give us give us a sense of what's the mood was like in that\nRally because as I said Andrew Gillum is leading runs the center of the incumbent Senator Bill Nelson and and the current governor Rick Scott seem to be in a in a dead heat with each other um for\nThe Senate seat so it was this rally tonight helpful to to those candidates or I'm not helpful [noise]\nIt would certainly helpful\nAs I said Andrew Gillum is leading runs into the incumbent Senator Bill Nelson [noise] uh and and the current governor Rick Scott seemed to be in a in a dead heat with each other\nFor the Senate seat so it was just rally tonight helpful to to those candidates for I'm not help [noise]\nIt was certainly helpful at this point uh the the candidates on both sides or or or done trying to persuade people who might have been undecided in this particular governor's race\nI don't think they tried very hard at all I think both sides are particularly of the Republicans decided we're just going to turn out the people who\nAre we um who we think voted for Trump can do that we went and so there was no attempt it persuasion of independent voters are finally getting a lot of Democrats\nAny of that what's interesting is this time for the\nFirst time in ever hurt really are the Democrats kind of do the same thing they take the most progressive Kennedy and who's not at all shy about it and they're saying look forget about reaching out to the metal we're just going to get our base there's more of us and then if we get tend to vote when we went and maybe that's what we're seeing in the poll like\nA a cautioned that regarding that polling the Republicans have very good\nPollsters and they feel that in the end of the people who actually come out to vote will be those who traditionally have done so which are Republicans I think they have a shot at\nWhat will you know and as to your point during the rally just before going on the air the president asked you told everyone you know it's important for you to get out there and vote in fact you can vote now how many have you voted raise your hand\nAnd everybody raised their hands and he even said wait you've all voted it's a hundred percent why am I here and he throws his hands and walked around the stage can you do what was the mood like in\nAnd to your point during the rally just before going on the air the president asked you told everyone you know it's important for you to get out there and vote in fact you can vote now how many have you voted raise your hand\nAnd everybody raised their hands and he even said wait you've all voted it's a hundred percent why am I here and he throws his hands and walked around the stage can you do what was the mood like in the room was that an electric moment during that rally\nIt was up but you know I mean the people who come to these things they want that they want to be entertained the thick of it more as a a a\nProfessional wrestling event than a political\nThing right that's what they come here they they know they're supposed to boot CNN and hate on the media and\nAnd then share when the good guys have done the things that they do you know Trump bragging about his victory so I wouldn't worry too much into that uh and if you are so interested in politics you're going to come to one of these things you probably have already voted by mail if you're older and Florida that's if you tend to do or it's one\nOf these early vote and stuff that you know ... it's like a good percentage perhaps\nEven half of the vote is going to be in before election day\nCan ask a question were there did you see I Know that at these rallies we've become accustomed to seeing a lot of red hot I'm beginning to pick up a lot of green hatch did you see them\nGo get the uh at the Trump rally just now I I did not what are you know when I'm not one that I Know what what they said\nWell I'm I'm I'm investigating oh okay but my sense is that the green hats are are tied to Pepe the frog and that in Somalia that um you know in a low key essentially white supremacist right\nYeah I can be I've not seen those and I've been to several\nOver the last few months are both on my own like tonight as well as part of the White House pool and um\nWell I'm I'm I'm investigating now okay but my sense is is that the green hats are are tied to Pepe the frog and that in Somalia that um you know in a low key essentially white supremacist right yeah I have\nTo be I've not seen those and I've been to several over the last few months are both on my own like tonight as well as part of the White House pool and I'm frankly have nothing that\n... are the folks who are at the rally tonight\nWould you say that they are they are more dissent is voters or Rick Scott boaters or are they Trump voters are they there because President Trump is there and Trump is there a guy and the census and and Scott or just ancillary figures\nYeah let's put it this way a rod status is lucky if he can get like fifty or sixty or a hundred people\nFor one of his events or which Scott has not been campaigning since\nMichael ... he has that excuse but this port Meyers Fort Myers is like red tide central in Missouri where the toxic algae came from the lake Okeechobee and make make life miserable continues to and is really hurting the business so Rick Scott was run out of his own rally\nOr back in in uh in August and September so he he had trouble this part of the state\nI'm I'm sure he gave me by motorcade so he's fine leaving but I doubt he would have had any where this kind of reception if it had not been for Donald Trump they could they're here for Donald Trump they're here for the show there for the entertainment\nOur rights should reach Dante has political reporter thank you very much for ... and I get calling in to the show down there in Fort Myers Florida where President Trump ended moments ago up for a rally for a Rick Scott who's running for Senate governor Rick Scott and ...\nThey've had not paper doll trickle down from the air for the show there for the entertainment\nOr ride Sharif Dante has political reporter thank you very much for hustling and um get calling in to the show down there in\nFort Myers Florida where President Trump ended moments ago up for a rally for a Rick Scott who's running for Senate governor Rick Scott and for round the census the former Republican congressman who's running for governor against Democrat Andrew Gillum who is also the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida Michigan thank you\nFor your facts were happy\nAnd a back with me as you as you heard from the question that she asked me to host and Kevin rubble art is also still with us Kevin thank\nYou very much for for a hanging on there\nYou know I'm ... one thing I wanted to to bring up before I go real quickly back to calls and that is sort of the question I asked\n... and that is how helpful is it to Republicans to have the president on the campaign trail whether he's campaigning for them as she reached that this is great for the census in ... Scott\nBut what about those Republicans running in purple districts for whom even though the president's not they're campaigning for them and speaking of Republican candidate the fact that the president is out there talking mixed their lives more difficult Kevin\nIt's it's interesting one thing though is uh CNN reported earlier today that in Trump's final rally schedule\nThe Trump White house actually decided not to send Trump to either Arizona or Nevada or in fears that he's more likely hurt Dean Heller and Martha McSally than he would be to help them which I think is a fairly good indication of their calculations are they're mostly sending him to the most friendly area and\nThey had a earlier today that in Trump's final rally schedule\nThe Trump White house actually decided not to send Trump to either Arizona or Nevada\nOr in fears that he more likely hurt Dean Heller and Arthur make Sally than he would be to help them which I think is a fairly good indication of their calculations here they're mostly sending him to the most friendly areas unfortunately for them because of the Senate map is so tilted towards Republicans ... there's a lot of places the guy", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "01"}
