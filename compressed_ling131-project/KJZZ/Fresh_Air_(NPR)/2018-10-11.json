O T L\nK joining me to explain what Medicare for all really is and what it isn't is Jonathan Cohn senior correspondent for half post Jonathan Cohn thank you for being on America on the line\nThank you for having me on the show\nSo Johnson the Democrats fail today to pass a bill that would have eliminated with being called short term health care plans that don't cover pre existing conditions what are the short term plans and why did Democrats wants to eliminate them\nShow short term plans have been around for a long time and they're kind of an artifact of the old you know the old Arab before we had the Affordable CARE Act um and they were designed as basically a stopgap you know you're between jobs you ... you know you're you're you're going to be a couple of months you know between this\nDish employer an employee or your insurance is going to laugh and you could pay out of pocket for these policies\nAnd they weren't very good right I mean they cover some things and you know maybe it's some doctor visits or maybe they didn't and\nBeen around for a long time and they're kind of an artifact of the old you know the old Arab before we had the Affordable CARE Act um and they were designed as basically a stopgap you know you're between jobs you ... you know you you you're going to be a couple of months you know between this dish employer an employee or your insurance is going to laugh and you could pay out of pocket for these policies\nAnd they weren't very good right I mean they covered some things and you know maybe it's an doctor visits or maybe they didn't and some hospitalization up to a point on and they wouldn't and it and they were sold like the old policies were right you couldn't get them if you had preexisting conditions and ah if you\nGot one of these policies and they discovered that you got sick but you'd actually had it before you bought the policy they wouldn't pay for that either or they charge you more you know for your pre existing condition um you know\nA four to ... comes along Obamacare comes along and now everybody a can get a you know it's supposed to be able to get comprehensive real insurance right you know the kind that you know would cover any medical service you might need and you know has a limit on you're out of pocket costs and\nUh the Obama administration said okay well you know now that we have this we don't need these short term policies anymore you know and they kind of let them linger but they were really\nCareful to say look they only last for three months and maybe it was basically they didn't want people buying these policies in part because a lot of people would buy them and not realize they were basically buying like a piece of junk coverage or something close to it\nWell you know the Trump Administration came in and they wanted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act they wanted to get rid of all these regulations that made you know kind of brands of insurance are available to everyone regardless of pre existing condition they couldn't do it right I mean we we all remember last year you know John McCain John McCain with a thumbs down and they mail it to pass\nA law so they've been trying to figure out ways to accomplish their repeal by executive action and and someone had the idea that well gee what if we just let more people ... these other ... these short term policies and basically they lifted the restrictions on them so you can basically take out one of these policies now and keep it for\nCondition they couldn't do it right I mean we we all remember last year you know John McCain John McCain with a thumbs down and they mail it to pass a law so they've been trying to figure out ways to accomplish their repeal by executive action and and someone had the idea that well gee what if we just let people more people buy these these other ... these short term policies\nAnd basically they lifted the restrictions on them so you can basically take out one of these policies now and keep it for a whole year and renew it and um [noise] you know the idea is that these policies if you can get one they're going to be a lot cheaper but that's because they cover a lot less and if you get sick you're going to be in real trouble and if you're already sick you won't be able to get one\nRight and and and that's the thing so is it that the short term plans are really good if you are basically healthy\nYeah I mean you know I I don't know if I Would die I hesitate even to say they're really good if you're a basically healthy um because the reality as we all know is that you're healthy until you're not healthy right\nRight well I should have said John who was there ... there are less expensive healthy\nAnd look if you if you're healthy right now and you buy one of these and you know you you go through the year or however long you hold U.S policy and you don't get a serious illness and you don't break your arm and you know you don't have a kid born with a congenital disease and yeah you know you'll look ... bank balance than at the end of year you'll have more money um\nBut you know that's that that's that's a that's a that's a roll the dice and it's a big roll the dice and the thing is you know look I cover this is my beat right health care I mean I've been reading about this for almost Twenty years right now I ... I went through one of these policies and the guys and I don't understand all the exclusions\nUm I I there's just no way people buying these policies most of them really understand what they're getting and in part because most people in their head they know that Obamacare is still the law they know the Affordable CARE Act is still there\nSo there's an assumption that you know if you buy insurance is going to cover what you need and you know the plans have to have a disclaimer and it's in the fine print but I can\nThe one of these policies and the guy and I don't understand all the exclusions\nUm I I there's just no way people buying these policies most of them really understand what they're getting and in part because most people in their head they know that Obamacare is still the law they know the Affordable CARE Act is still there\nSo there's an assumption that you know if you buy insurance is going to cover what you need and\nYou know the plans have to have a disclaimer and it's in the fine print but I can tell you I even got a telemarketing call from one of these companies and I can tell you it's very confusing and I I'm willing to bet money that a huge number of people buying names won't know what they're getting and that's not pure conjecture because in the old days that used to happen\nAll the time and insurance commissioners will get flooded with complaints\nSo let's talk about the president's op ed that was published in USA Today on Wednesday today\nAnd it's been slam um buy lots of fact checkers\nAnd other folks as being filled with false could and mischaracterization that some might even say lives but in his op ed he slammed the Democrats were taking away health care and trying to turn America into Venezuela and in and he also claimed that he wants to protect people with preexisting condition\nUm ... what's really what is the president's record on that\nI I you know that's a total lie I mean that I I don't really know how to say and um I actually try not to use the word lie except in cases where I think someone actually actually knows they're not telling the truth and has deliberately missing the people and I think this is one of those cases um\nYou know a President Trump spent last year trying to push through that repeal legislation and repeal legislation um would have undermined the existing protections for pre existing conditions\nNow it had some features in there that you know they threw when if you may remember back when when they were writing the bill they said well you know we'll have a special provision you know for example won't actually let insurance companies\nThose cases um you know a President Trump spent last year trying to push through that repeal legislation and repeal legislation um would have undermined the existing protections for pre existing conditions\nNow it had some features in there that you know they threw when if you may remember back when when they were writing the bill they said well you know we'll have a special provision you know for example won't actually let insurance companies deny coverage because of a pre existing condition\nBut you know they would still let you know it you know they would let in certain cases they will that insurers charge more right\nSo yeah you have diabetes and\nThey can't deny you coverage but they can charge you a lot more for it so much they couldn't afford it so that's you know that's effectively the same thing I mean can you talk to any expert they will tell you can't have just one piece of the pre existing protections you have to have them all together\nSo you know that's what he was doing last year and now this year as I mentioned we were just talking about the junk insurance a regulation that undermines protections for pre existing conditions but there's even more\nCrystal clear example which is there's this lawsuit down in Texas it's a federal lawsuit it is I it is a crazy loopy you will be hard pressed to find a respectful legal expert who think it has things that has any merit but there's a lawsuit that was filed by some conservative Republican\nState officials calling on the federal courts to throw out a\nThe protections for pre existing conditions and normally in normal times when someone sues\nA to declare a federal law unconstitutional the Justice Department defense that law in court and doesn't matter whether the administration likes it or not that's\nThe way the system works you're the Justice Department it's unless you know allies like agree jealously unconstitutional you defended the Trump Administration you know this is the Trump Administration they don't do things like people usually do it they decided nope we're gonna we're not only we are not only will we not defend the law we're going to file a brief instead\nConstitutional the Justice Department defense that law in court and doesn't matter whether the administration likes it or not that's\nThe way the system works at the Justice Department it's unless you know allies like agree just fully unconstitutional you defended\nThe Trump Administration you know this is the Trump Administration they don't do things like people usually do it they decided nope we're gonna we're not only we are not only will we not defend the law we're going to file a brief\nIn support of the plant that so they are the Trump Administration of right now has its name on a lawsuit asking a federal judge to throw out the protections for pre existing condition so I don't know how you can have your name on that lawsuit and then get up and you know USA Today or what you know Fox News or wherever and say\nHey I Want to protect preexisting conditions I mean this is just you know this is crazy\nWell let's talk about the politics of what happened today in in the Senate and this bill um unlimited unlimited the short term health care plans was being pushed hard by the Democrats the Democrats are in the minority in the Senate and even though this this bill went down to it only went down by\nBy one vote a fifty fifty and the vice president of president and then it ... the the deciding vote but why did the Democrats push this bill was it up your political opponents your political move\nWell I think you know uh when you're in the minority at the Democrats are are you are always in the position of trying to propose legislation that's gonna not ... that's going to have a very slim chance of passing now I think they thought they had a good chance of getting it through the Senate I mean as you said they came up one vote short\nOr we we've got to take a break will probably come back to this at another time when we return more with our panel and more of your calls at ... for for seven four five eight to five five

on the line from WNYC radio and public radio stations across the country this is a show about politics in the mid term elections and\nNow the election day is twenty seven days away we want to check in on key races here what the candidates are talking about and share some of their notable commercials still with me in Studio\nTo do that are Brian Lehrer hosts of the Brian Lehrer show and WNYC and Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell before we jump into calls and commercial Brian you want it in on what we were talking about in the at the very end of the last segment about the fed and the president attacking the fed\nTo things I think that the tension that's going on in the markets right now shows how the interests of workers in the interest of owners are sometimes at odds and raises the question which one is the government including that said I'm going to favor this happens\nWhat we're talking about in the at the very end of the last segment about the fed and the president attacking the fed\nTo things I think that the tension that's going on in the markets right now shows how the interests of workers in the interest of owners are sometimes at odds and raises the question which one\nIs the government including the said I'm going to favor this happened back in the nineties as well unemployment would go down\nThe fed would raise interest rates so that unemployment didn't go down\nTo quickly uh and spark inflation and progressive set that time what how all at the fed for raising rates because it was like the fed Alan Greenspan in those days why did enough unemployment why does he want workers to be out of jobs that's not progressive\nAnd if we're looking at Trump now putting pressure politically on the fed is hardly unique I pulled out this article from Nineteen Ninety three justice Bill Clinton was taking office\nFrom the New York times and it says Mr Clinton and the governors of the fed or on a collision course because of the central bank wants economic growth to continue its slow takeoff hoping to keep inflation heading down or the Mr Clinton's advisors have a quite different goal for faster economic growth to fulfill his campaign pledge sound familiar\nYeah but I mean I don't know where we did you say that President Clinton did President Clinton directly attack the fed\nIt was it was Leon Panetta which one of his official right as a child that sort of move yeah with who job on the fed and he was on largely um\nAdmonished for that by economists and others who said we again we need the fat to maintain its credibility it has been a hard hard won credibility one over the decades and you can make that disappear quite quickly if you don't believe that the fed is ending\nHis official right as a job is to remove yeah with who job on the fed and he was um largely um\nAdmonished for that by economists and others who said we again we need the fed to maintain its credibility\nIt has been a hawk or a hard one credibility one over the decades and you can make that disappear quite quickly if you don't believe that the fed is independent if you believe that the fed is subject to the day to day political wins\nI'm of the populace and can be sort of strong arm into doing what's politically expedient for the guy in the White House so actually after that those comments were made\n'em and I think Panetta actually make make comments a couple of times um there was some sort of rule implemented within the White House saying okay from now on we're not going to publicly comment\nOn said policy no or the value of the dollar or various other things that\nYou want there to not be any political meddling in I'm In for the most part administrations have stuck to that although there have been some deviations including many more recently\nAs the as you were speaking eat his bunkers thing and those are the days was rolling through my head let's go back to the question that I asked of listeners at the beginning of the show does Medicare for all seem like a good idea or one of those too good to be true promises that politicians can't really deliver on\nAsk you to call for for seven four five eight to five five then in West Chester thank you for calling into America on the line\nCan you hear me yes I can\nOkay thanks for taking my call I think that I've ... I'll Try to be quick one I think it's funny that this has become such a partisan issue I mean we have the rights that's very for or against it in the left is it Fort in France my wife is from France my son was born in France and she got a right or left issue you could be very far away\nCalling into America on the line how can you hear me yes I can\nOkay thanks for taking my call I think that I have three points and I'll I'll Try to be quick one I think it's funny that this has become such a part of the same issue I mean we have the right that's very far or against it and the left is\nIs for it in France my wife is from France and my son was born in France it's not a right or left issue you can be very far right an anti immigration anti euro zone 'em but you love your health insurance you that that's something that they can agree on\nAnd I know that this was going to sound bad but I'm sure if we were to kind of ... down a Americans' throats so to speak and universal health care which is something that we accepted like you go to church on Sunday and when you're Twenty one is a drinking if we can continue to fight\nAbout everything from immigration and abortion and gun control but we will have this thing that really works very well and we have an example of that\nUh the second point is that a is a law suits on the medical insurance so what happens in in France when my son was born so I had a son born here in France who is on\nA born in uh in New York a midwife delivered a my son they don't have an OBGYNs see the thing the philosophy and the French system if you will see Trump you try to provide the best quality care at the cheapest price having an OBGYN there is a very uh extensive\nWe have more C sections in ... in America than we do in France why because people are afraid of getting suit my son was very sick the other day he was like vomiting a lot the doctor said okay just taken here I guess you can see our that might be expensive why didn't doctors say that because no one percent chance of something that happens to my son he's going to get sued that just doesn't work that way\nThen with ... [laughter]\nYeah so the third point in a business small business owner and will you know you hire and fire people big deals you have insurance you offer insurance in my school district I I\nIt's the other day he was like vomiting allowed the doctor said okay just taken here I guess you can see our that might be expensive why didn't doctors say that because of one percent chance that something bad happens to my son he's going to get suits that\nJust doesn't work that way then within their rights [noise] yeah so\nThe third point is a small business owner\nAnd will you know you hire and fire people big deals you have insurance you offer insurance at my school district I send my kids to the vet for central school district they had a great idea to do insurance in house in other words they said we have a big enough pool of teachers\nThat were just going to kind of do our own insurance what happened\nA couple of teachers got very sick or they had cancer or prices skyrocketed and now I literally have to pay more taxes people don't understand the effects of this there are companies that large companies was American Airlines recently that the legacy that they have to pay for all the people at Penn shares or not or who no longer\nWork for them I don't think that universal healthcare is good for business and it's not good for individuals are skewed and they are the current system\nBanned I I Want to thank you very much [laughter] been going on I mean a lot of material Brian Catherine dive in\nWell my two kids were both delivered by midwives with the doctor on call if something went wrong and it was\nBetter for humanity a kind of you know human scale with my wife and me and it was cost effective so I support the story that he told with respect to France but\nOn the larger point there's a basic tension in healthcare economics whether you go liberal or conservative that there is so much medical technology available in the modern world\nWe could spend an infant and the amount of money to cover everyone for everything so every society rations health care but you can ration it like Canada or against France where basically everyone is covered for all the same things and they have to decide\nYou point there's a basic tension in healthcare economics whether you go liberal or conservative that there is so much medical technology available in the modern world\nWe could spend an infant and the amount of money to cover every one for everything so every society ration health care but you can rationalize like Canada or against France where basically everyone is covered for all the same things and they have to decide how much they're willing to be taxed\nVersus how much they're willing to go without for the most part you know everybody gets the the same things are denied the same things preexisting conditions is not an issue because everyone is just covered in\nThis country there is a tension between these two ideals that the two parties hold Democrats want insurance to be comprehensive which means insurance costs more Republicans one cheaper insurance to be available which means it will cover less\nAt one point that I wanted to make that at sort of came through in this caller's comments is that to have universal healthcare you don't need to have single payer\nAnd I think that gets lost in the debate quite a bit actually ... you know all other major industrialized countries have universal health care they do not all have single payer they have some ... some patchwork system\nI'm of private insurance and public insurance or they might require a people to get tempted by one of a set of plans but but most of those countries do not have single payer and the\nProposal that is generally on the table here on the left\nIs this term Medicare for all are single pair and there are a lot of other ways\nTo get to the ultimate goal of making sure that everybody has health insurance that do not have to look like that model including having a public option which you may recall was on the table when Obamacare was being discussed including having a more robust individual insurance market you know sort of strength\nIs this term Medicare for all are single payer and there are a lot of other ways to get to the ultimate goal of making sure that everybody has health insurance that do not have to\nLook like that model including having a public option which you may recall was on the table when Obamacare was being discussed including having a more robust individual insurance markets you know sort of strengthening\nThis is ...

I Want you to explain what you mean by the jungle grows back and I want you to expand on on this one line that's on page nine of your of your book you say that the creation of the liberal order has been an act of defiance against both history and human nature\nTalk more about that\nSure I mean you know if you think about the great a sweep of human history or most people have lived under tyranny in poverty and in the state of constant warfare and that's pretty much the story\nOf humankind going back as far as recorded\nHistory and I'm sure back before that as well um and the period that we've been living in since the end of World War two a has been entirely different that's been a time of incredible prosperity we've seen for a million people\nMove out of poverty into the middle class or it's been a period of incredible explosion of democracy like the world is never seen before and\nGoing back as far as recorded history and I'm sure back before that as well\nUm and the period that we've been living in since the end of World War two a has been entirely different that's been a time of incredible prosperity we've seen four billion people\nMove out of poverty or into the middle class or it's been a period of an incredible explosion of democracy like the world is never seen before and it's also\nA been a period of great power peace we didn't have the kind of world wars that we saw 'em in the first half of the twentieth century so it's an extraordinary period but it it we have to understand that historically it's an aberration\nUm and the point I Want to make is that it really requires active efforts to sustain it because nature in a sense a wants to tear it down in the international system\nOr the natural order is chaos and conflict um and you know human beings don't necessarily go toward democracy so this is somebody that requires active efforts we've done it for a long time and we need to continue to work at it\nIn fact you write if the liberal order is like a garden artificial in forever threatened by the forces of nature preserving it requires a persistent\nOn ending struggle against the vines and weeds that are constantly working to undermine it from within and overwhelm it\nFrom from with out of you know later on in the book you talk about the fact that you know Americans actually question why their country needs to be so deeply involved in the rest of the world this is something\nThat while President Trump ran on you know in America first agenda this that sentiment predates President Trump doesn't it\nIt does I think ever since the end of the Cold War I think Americans have been asking why they need to shoulder this enormous burden of ah of sort of maintaining peace and prosperity and the liberal world\nInvolved in the rest of the world this is something that while President Trump ran on that you know in America first agenda this that sentiment predates President Trump doesn't it\nIt does I think ever since the end of the Cold War I think Americans have been asking why they need to shoulder this enormous burden of ah of sort of maintaining peace and prosperity and the liberal world order and it's not surprising that they would because it really is\nAn unusual role of ... no country in history has ever played it before and I think most people thought that when the Soviet Union collapsed that they really we really didn't have to continue doing that\nI'm a unfortunately the sad reality is we're seeing all around us the jungle does grow back there all kinds of bad actors out there and if the United states does not continue to play this role then eventually the jungle overwhelms us and even overwhelms Americans\nUm one of the things that you and I've talked about this before [noise] excuse me and you've talked about the fact that um the United states ... ... at least within the last Seventy years if has not been eggs quote unquote normal nation what is a normal nation [noise] well a normal\nNation is a nation that looks after itself first and really only most nations in history have looked after their own of security in their own economic\nWell being and it's not taken responsibility for a larger world order and the key word here is responsibility you know people talk about Americans being isolationists they're not isolationist they're always heavily involved in the world the question is\nDo they want to take responsibility\nFor maintaining a certain kind of order and I think that is the great\nChallenge and it it it does require all it's costly if\nCost lives and it also has a moral burden because when you exercise power it's impossible not to exercise it\nYou know ... they're not isolationist they're always heavily involved in the world the question is\nDo they want to take responsibility for maintaining a certain kind of order and I think that is the great challenge and it it it does require\nAll it's costly if it costs lives and it also has a moral burden because when you exercise power it's impossible not to exercise it to some degree a morally it's the nature of exercising power so it's entirely\nUnderstandable that Americans would want us to offload this responsibility unfortunately in the world is configured on such a way\nThat if Americans do offload that responsibility than we had back\nFor chaos and disorder and tyranny and all the things that we saw before the United states began playing this role\nNow you write towards the middle of the book about how there are rules of the road here with this a liberal small D democratic\nUh order that um we've been living under for for Seventy years and that basically it's a sense of fairness um that even though the United states is the a military power in in in an economic ... power\nBy and large it doesn't use its power to run roughshod over other members of the of the global order\nHave that right [noise] yeah so I'm a ... and I want to hasten to to uh make clear that that doesn't mean the United states doesn't sometimes take advantage of its power it doesn't mean we're not selfish or doesn't mean we're not how critical it doesn't mean we don't make terrible mistakes because where humans and that's just the nature of these but by and large\nThe order we created in order to be successful\nHad to be one in which the other members felt that they were getting a fair shake that we weren't exploiting are enormous power to sort of get it over on them and when every deal I mean we allowed Germany to do better than we were doing in the protest\nA critical it doesn't mean we don't
