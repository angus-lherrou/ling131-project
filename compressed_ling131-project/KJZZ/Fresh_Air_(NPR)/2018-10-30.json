O T L\nJoining me now in the studio is Julian zealous or professor of history at Princeton University and co author of the upcoming book fault lines a history of the United states since Nineteen Seventy four professor sellers are generally and welcome\nTo American America America on the line thanks for having me here I'm actually I'm going to ask you about the the ... to quickly talk about what are the fault lines in America since since Seventy four did they lie on on\nIssues are cultural issues all of them I mean we have big political ... which we talk about every day between the two parties where the center has disappeared and where their fundamental differences in terms of what the party's stand for and the kind of politics they practice or social divisions are and even though many people are\nIn a in America since since Seventy four and two they lie on on\nPolitical issues are cultural issues all of them I mean we have big political fishers which we talk about every day between the two parties where the center has disappeared\nAnd we are there fundamental differences in terms of what the party's stand for and the kind of politics they practice or social divisions and even though many people are optimistic about what they see at home or in their community\nOn big questions about gender about race about immigration\nI think we have a kind of pretty big ah areas of separation that had been growing for decades at this point and that's why they're so hard to resolve a and then in the economy we have literal division a of economic wealth and\nAn economic well being and that's the problem we've inequality that we talk about what the thinning of the middle class\nAnd the growth of of wealthier Americans and lower class Americans with as many divisions that are circulating ... that play into moments like these\nSo on on Saturday President Trump said quote you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past he talked about\nAnd this was in response to um the murders in in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh and and I'm asking this question because I Want you to talk about anti Semitism in the early twentieth century and\nWhite terms like nationalist and nativist our dog whistles\nSure anti Semitism has a long history in this country even though sometimes\nAh people forget just how bad it was the turn of the twentieth century or you had first nativism which was this a attack on immigration was often aimed at Jews there Eastern European Jews coming into this country they were often the targets and the rhetoric was horrendous about\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part time controller dot com\nAimed at Jews or Eastern European Jews coming into this country\nThey were often the targets and the rhetoric was horrendous about the character of Jews and about unsavory elements of the Jewish community this was used to close the borders are essentially to shut down the entrance of immigration and nationalism obviously are in the United states and then in Europe in the Nineteen thirties\nWas connected often isolated marginalizing Jews as the enemy of the people\nAre meaning the enemy of of the nation and that term directly connected to Nazi isn't fascism and so in that term is a vote\nOr it means a lot it carries a lot of weight to the president's right in terms of learning from the past but question if is if if he learned from the past that all\n... at a at a rally I Believe it was it was last week or maybe it was the week before last at all runs together but he's stood on stage and said flat out\nI'm a nationalist and a lot of people freaked out and and lost their minds and I'm sure there were a lot of people around the country who we thought well what's the big deal as he explained he use about ... he's about America and America First and America First is a dog whistle\nSure America First comes out of the Nineteen thirties it was a isolationist movement to keep the United states out of war Charles Lindbergh the famous aviator was the spokesperson\nAnd it was anti Semitic very often including Lindbergh a with a admiration for the Nazis so even the term America First which people now it's kind of common place it has a pretty powerful history\nWhistle sure America First comes out of the Nineteen thirties it was a isolationist movement to keep the United states out of war Charles Lindbergh the famous aviator was the spokesperson\nAnd it was anti cinematic very often including Lindbergh a with a admiration for the Nazis so even the term America First which people now\nIt's kind of common place it has a pretty powerful history and I'm not sure the president as being totally straight or I don't think he has I think he understands these votes certain things in the policy and I think he's trying to capitalize on this for his own political benefit\nWell this actually gets to a question I was going to ask you about something that you wrote last week in the Atlantic where you wrote quote the president has built his approach around it simple proposition Republicans will always come home and at the president President Trump has tested this approach twice now\n... can you break that down for us and in your answer talk about what it means\nWhen the republic when Republicans come home\nBased on language that is mired\nIn fear and hate and bigotry\nThe the basic argument was we we are we are very polarized country and social scientists argue that Republicans have actually become more polarized they're more ideologically\nA homogeneous they're more loyal to the party than Democrats there's less division\nAnd this is a phenomenon that's been developing he understands this and\nHe is not trying to unite the other side he's not trying to win over voters from the other side he's trying to solidify his standing with in the Republican Party and he's counting on the fact that in the end and he's not wrong Republicans won't vote for Democrats they will come back so you do everything possible\nAnd this is a phenomenon that's been developing he understands this and\nHe is not trying to unite the other side he's not trying to win over voters from the other side he's trying to solidify his standing with in the Republican Party and he's counting on the fact that in the end and he's not wrong\nRepublicans won't vote for Democrats they will come back so you do everything possible to build your own coalition rather than to expand it\nAnd I think part of that is appealing to extremist elements are and he's he's trying to get them to turn out by talking about immigration restrictions and more\nAnd then part of it is the assumption he can do all of that and the other Republicans are still going to vote for him and that is what we saw in two thousand sixteen we see it with the Republicans in Congress and my guess is you'll see it again in the mid ...\nWhat what what's interesting here is that you said that ... ... you know he's banking on Republicans coming back and if you look at any\nPublic opinion polls the president's job approval rating is bouncing in the high thirties low to mid forties nationally but when you look at his approval rating among Republicans it's stratospheric it's\nHigh eighties maybe even not Ninety percent among Republicans so is it that Republicans are coming home or is it that he's doing this to make sure that Republicans\nGo vote because I Would argue they haven't left home\nYou know he he out now they they they look what I mean is there some complaints along the way and you have someone like Senator flake warning of a threat to our democracy\nOr but in the end ... in the polls you're seeing they aren't really going anywhere are and you have to curb the eighty percent because we're talking about him doing things that are really unconventional I still has a that that percentage or so\nOh you only see out now they they they look what I mean is there some complaints along the way and you have someone like Senator flake warning of a threat to our democracy\nBut in the end ... in the polls you're seeing they aren't really going anywhere are and you have to curb the eighty percent because we're talking about him doing things that are really unconventional I still have\nA that that percentage are so part of this is all I mean by coming home is come voting day they're not going to vote for the Democrats and then the rest of it is exactly what you're saying he's just trying to make sure in a turnout battle which is going to happen next week he gets as many people out there as possible\nAnd and we'll see what happens obviously this week changed\nThe story at least in terms of what American the thinking about ... where we were a week ago but right but I don't know what will unfold and the next few\nDays the well what do you think um ... well you know let me think about this question a little a little bit more while we we turn to call and I want to go to Michael who's calling in from Milwaukee, Wisconsin Michael thank you for calling into America on the line\nThank you so the question was what are you pessimistic about and I asked people to call into a four

gave the number the board of blew up lit up\nIt's like a Christmas tree here and so I mean it took a couple of calls before we get to our panel let's go to Susan who's calling in from bath Maine's Susan thank you for calling into America on the line said\nThank you for taking my call\nWhat are you pessimistic about this\n[noise] I Am pessimistic that we are not in gays of national mourning because of what happened at the synagogue yesterday [laughter] ah you know we we are a country that one way\nAmerica on the line\nThank you for taking my call what are you pessimistic about [noise]\nI Am pessimistic that we are not in days of national mourning because of what happened at the synagogue yesterday a\nYou know we we are a country\nThat one way or another we have always felt our human connection to each other and that represents\nA fundamental moral breach in my view it's a fundamental breach of human connection a route or what has happened instead of the national morning and I'd give Sarah Huckabee credit for breaking down\nA today um we continue to intellectual ISIS this this is more fodder\nFor uh the into little intellectual was Asian um the human heart what\nThe human eye sees is a very good moral instructor or in the last segment somebody was talking about how do we get how do we get a grip on global um global warming is a wonderful book based on the human heart called rising by Elizabeth\nRussians which speaks very specifically to how the human heart observes um we we need to be in morning about this and not intellectual argument but letting our hearts feel the pain that\nSays Susan I Want to thank you very much for for calling in to the show um let's come closer to home here from the studios are Jimmy like calling in from Hudson County New Jersey Jimmy

you for calling into America on the line [noise]\nHi thank you for taking my call to find work or what do you ask them to sign up for\nI worried about uh the increasing racially motivated violence that we've been saying and I'm listening a on WNYC and there was just a segment and in previous show about the uh Pittsburgh shooter and they talk about how unremarkable he was as a neighboring how he was a quiet guy and\nThese kinds of stories make me feel uncomfortable because the emphasis is on how normal he was not that we should be bothered by how normal he was but that we should somehow identify with him um\nMajor print publications do the same thing with these far right figures portraying them as you know just your average neighborhood guy\nFailing to push back on their hateful ideology isn't that treating them like their ideology or a legitimate response\nTo something that some actual breathing something that happened in their life or something that they'd observed or something like that and it normalize it stays hateful ideas so it makes me feel unsafe when the media goes out of their way to make these guys seem like just a regular\nYou know mhm regular people they could be your neighbor as opposed to you know the hateful ideologues that are really trying to kill up\nTo me I Want to thank you very much for calling in from Hudson County New Jersey and ...

Christina ...\nCalling from New Jersey is I think speaking for millions\nOf Americans but African Americans in particular\nI mean you know I see this on Twitter quite a bit whenever the New York times does one of their weekly\nA glowing stories about one of the Proud Boys there's someone from some you know right wing far right Nazi affiliated association\nA which they'll call the alt right but it's like wow they we're plaid shirt from Abercrombie and they drink Pepsi Blue ribbon beer and are they cool and they they went to overland you know and these stories that try and quote unquote normalize them where these people are terrors\nEither either domestic terrorists or their terrorizing communities\nWith their ideology and now we see with their actions\nAnd so I I Do agree with Jimmy and where we have to be a lot more um\nForceful and pushing back on some of these media narratives that you know even time had at the framing of an article that said you know like oh why can't the right sort of you know express itself and you know what's wrong with America and the framing of that is totally\nInappropriate it's unacceptable and it feeds into some of unfortunately what we're seeing I'm obviously Sarah ...\nForceful and pushing back on some of these media narratives that you know even time had in the framing of an article that said you know like oh why can't the right sort of you know express itself and you know what's wrong with America and and the framing of that is totally\nInappropriate it's unacceptable and it feeds into some of unfortunately what we're seeing I'm\nObviously Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway or the masters of this really taking these horrible events and\nReally terrible individuals that live in our country and it really normalizing them and turn it back on Americans and saying no it isn't that what you're seeing your the problem actually I'm the president is you know the what about Islam and we've talked about at it for an item um but I think it it really does scare some people because we now\nAre seeing that there are a lot of Americans\nLiving in a really constant state of fear and what really brought it home not just with an African American communities but talking to a lot of my younger students\nUm and seeing how growing up in a culture of guns in school shootings has really changed your outlook on life and I think now we're seeing more and more Americans recognizing that they're not safe in their own country because\nAnti Semitism is rented and it seems as though it's co signed by the upper echelons of our government ... ... ... you name it seemed to be\n... by the upper ... upper echelons of our government into quote Andrew Gillum you know I'm not calling the president right through but it seems like the raises think you're a racist so um that's where we are\nCharlie focused on the question of being pessimistic view is I ... it did occur to me that there was one time we told ourselves when we had a terrible tragedy of brought up the best in us and and do still see that but it's also increasingly brings out the worst in the U.S and and I and what what I'm most\nThere but it seems like the raises think you're a racist so um that's where we are Charlie while I was focused on the question of being pessimistic because yeah I\nIt it it did occur to me that there was one of the time we told ourselves when we had a terrible tragedy of brought out the best in us and and do still see that but it's also\nIncreasingly brings out the worst in the U.S and and I and what what are the most pessimistic about is that we're in this cycle where everything that's happening now is going to get worse\nAnd in part it is because of what the what we're learning about our fellow Americans that we have some of the darkness um that we have played around with ideas we've engaged in a cynical\nOr as you know cynical efforts to divide the American people for electoral again and you know how amazing that you know if you have a president United States that traffics in these dark conspiracy theories and nativism and and\nPlays up the notion that we are all under the attack that we are being invaded by these dangerous people who are heading north and that perhaps third Jewish financiers were bankrolling all of this I mean imagine um that there are unbalanced people who will then act on all of this\nAnd you wonder if we're at the beginning of this rather than at the end we're at the beginning\nOf of a moment when we're going to see you know what comes out when we someone this kind of darkness internally that was pretty dark and I'm Sorry to be that pessimistic ...\nKnow I'm a I Believe it was Susan who called in from from ... Maine who was sort of re moaning the fact that we we haven't even had a chance to mourn um the the murders of those people at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and I was wondering is it because we\nA mistake ... you know I'm a I Believe it was Susan who called in from from ...

Brunn must be doing something right or is he\nWell he's a Republican and a Republican state or which is at this point are pretty easy thing to be um he's he's running as an outsider type candidate he served in the state legislature for a few years and didn't have a huge impact there but\nUm and he served on the local school board but he hasn't really been involved in big time politics before this but says he was inspired to run for the Senate by Donald Trump because he sees them as having similar profiles outsiders not a lot of time in politics Mike Braun has a very successful auto parts business here he's a pretty wealthy guy who has put a lot of his own money into this race\nSo speaking of outsiders me even though senator Donnelly is ... is a Democrat he's a bit of an outsider when it comes to his party he's pro life he's an anti tax Democrat who's not afraid of running campaign ads to emphasize his conservatism like this one\n\nI flew in my own party [noise]\nJust for funding for Trump's border wall a liberal left wants to shops defense spending no way I'm not into a fair fight some about giving our troops E. S. [noise]\nI've voted to extend the Bush tax cuts and Mike Braun sea ships jobs to China\nI mean Brandon Trump's border wall defense spending Bush tax cuts and his uh his opponent ships jobs to China\nYeah if you didn't know Joe Donnelly was a Democrat you'd have ...\nBy some about giving our troops E. S. [noise]\nI've voted to extend the Bush tax cuts and Mike Ross Sea ships jobs to China I mean Brandon Trump's border wall defense spending Bush tax cuts and his uh his opponent ships jobs to China\nYeah if you didn't know Joe Donnelly was a Democrat you'd have trouble sometimes knowing the Joe Donnelly the Democrat [laughter] which is quite frankly which is quite frankly why at a lot of campaign events whether it's my Bronner a member of the Republican Party they they call him Democrat Donnelly\nA as if to just constantly remind people hey don't forget he's actually a Democrat and not a Republican despite what he's trying to tell you what Joe Donnelly will tell you is that he doesn't belong really to either party that he stands for Hoosier but he's they're hired help that's his line\nSo how is he viewed by Democrats in ... in Indiana I\nFavorably by some certainly I mean the reality is that Indiana is a fairly conservative state so I think a lot of Democrats even if they don't necessarily agree with Joe Donnelly on a lot of these issues\nUnderstand that in order to win a statewide election here you have to side with the other side if you will um from time to time at the same time that the ... Donnelly has ads like that though\nUh to the votes that he's most criticized for by Republicans here are two votes that he proudly stands behind which is against the tax reform bill and in favor of the Affordable CARE Act or Obamacare he he talks about him\nHimself being the last line of defense to save Obamacare in Congress and he's been that way since he served in the house or more than a decade\nAgo now see you didn't mentioned the one vote he cast that I that I thought you were going to mention that we're giving him trouble and that is he voted against Jeff now justice Kavanaugh's confirmation\nHe did and he's quick to tell you but he did vote for\nOf being the last line of defense to save Obamacare in Congress and he's been that way since he served in the house or more than a decade\nAgo now see I see you didn't mention the one vote he cast that I that I thought you were going to mention that we're giving him trouble and that is he voted against just now justice Kavanaugh's confirmation\nYes he did and he's quick to tell you but he did vote for\nA President Trump's previous nominee Neil Gorsuch and he uses that to sort of defend why he didn't vote for cabinet which was it wasn't that he had opposition to him sort of on the ideological spectrum he talks about having concerns about his judicial temperament and his impartiality and he points to that\nNow relatively famous hearing of course in the Senate Judiciary committee so he talks about it as listen\nI'm an independent thinker it's not about I'm opposed to President Trump and his nominees because look I voted for Neil Gorsuch I voted for Seventy seven percent of President Trump's judicial nominees I was against Brett Kavanaugh as the person\nSo ... in the CBS battleground tracker poll the libertarian candidate Lucy Brenton she gets three percent is taking votes from Donnelly or Braun is she even a factor in this race\nYes and yes or to all of those questions um I think three percent is low she ran two years ago as well for the U.S Senate against\nHaving by and and now US Senator Todd Young and got five and a half percent of the vote which is usually which is about right for what we libertarians are getting those sorts of races here in Indiana\nI Would say if she can only get three percent that's very low I Would expect it to be more like five or six or even seven percent and yes in a margin of error race like the one we have here she could absolutely have an impact the problem is\nThat from what little polling we've seen that tells us if she's drawing from either candidate she's\nA half percent of the boat which is usually which is about right for what we libertarians are getting in those sorts of races here in Indiana I Would say if she can only get three percent that's very low I Would expect it to be more like five or six or even seven percent and yes in a margin of error race like the one we have he or she could absolutely have an impact the problem is\nThat from what little polling we've seen that tells us if she's drawing from either candidate she's actually drawing from both um obviously you think of a libertarian you think of them pulling votes away from Republicans and there's some of that but she has some messages\nI'm On things like a medical marijuana or cannabis in general or that appeal to more liberal voters so she's probably drawing from both of them so we'll have an impact probably will be toward one candidate or another harder to say\nAll right Brandon before before I let you go I have to ask you about some competitive house races in Indiana as well the ninth congressional district what's going on there\nYeah that's if if Democrats are gonna flip a district in Indiana which is still a bit of a long shot it's going to be in the ninth where Trey Hollingsworth as a freshman Republican who hasn't really endeared himself I feel like\nTo the states uh yet or to his district as much as he might like to part of that is because he only moved to Indiana a few months before he ran for Congress back in twenty sixteen uh like twenty Fifteen\nSo I think that Democrats are still trying to attack him for that and the uh the Democrat here as a woman named Liz Watson from Bloomington\nShe is though appealing to particularly liberal voters which has some scratching their heads because that's not necessarily how you win and the district like that and then to Ghana\nInteresting Brandon Smith from Indiana Public ... public broadcasting in Indianapolis thank you very much for being on America on the line thank you so much
