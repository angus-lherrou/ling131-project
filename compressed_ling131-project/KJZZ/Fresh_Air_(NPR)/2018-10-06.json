adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters\nHer new film private life opens in theaters and start streaming Netflix this Friday\nLet's start with a scene Catherine hon plays Rachel a writer married to Richard a theater director played by Paul Giamatti who makes a living with his gourmet pickle business they live on a limited budget in the East Village in Manhattan\nThe fertility treatments have already taken a lot out of them when the fertility doctor tells Rachel that her best bet is finding an egg donor that is not something she wants to do and\nShe lets Richard no it as they walked down the street after leaving the fertility clinic\nNo way in hell on doing\nWhat we should think about it [noise]\nI'm not saying that we would do it right which are just explore the idea of you know we feel\nLike a list of all the pros and cons [noise]\nWe talked about this we ... we would never do it no use for that you would never do what are your\n[laughter] I kept my mouth shut\nBecause I didn't want to pressure you into something that you were going to have to live with for the rest of your life\n... all the time that I'm assuming that we feel the same way about this have been having secret fantasies about egg donation\nWe talked about this war and we would never do it no use for\nThat you would never do it I\n[laughter] I kept my mouth shut\nBecause I didn't want to pressure you into something that you were going to have to live with for the rest of your life\nWeights so all the time that I'm assuming that we feel the same way about this he's been having secret Santa thing good egg donation it's not a secret fantasy it to me I didn't know about it I thought that we had decided together as a couple that we would definitely draw the line at science fiction\nIt's not science fiction writer it's pretty primitive actually they do it with farm animals all the time\nOkay that example I'm Sorry oh my God you're like so long haul right now it's taking me out I Am not going to hold on just\nA matter of luck if we do another ivy off with your ex we've got what a four percent chance of getting pregnant with a donor egg we'd be going from four to like sixty five percent of the gambler me just wants to put my money on the better off\nMy God you're guy would have\nWatched the husband in Rosemary's Baby John Cassidy that's here yeah ... that's me standing by while you're right by a satanic demons I Am just suggesting that we listen to our doctor and look into all the options were already signed up for adoption what is the big deal I'm well for one I'm not putting someone else's body parts in my uterus\nA ... again it's just\nIt's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having a baby in what that's going to be like it can lead ride that moment but that\nProcess is just so so different\nYeah it it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination who you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in the stir ups [laughter] and the fertility\nClinic from the point of view Catherine ... so you're seeing the doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view of you out of abuse so many women have had so many times [laughter] [noise] um yeah and I'm ... I actually um the\nDon't come off very well on your movie was that your parents\nIf we're ... a clinic from the point of view Catherine ... so you're seeing a doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view yeah it was one of you so many women have had so many times [laughter]\n[noise] um yeah and I'm ... I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents I actually had great doctors it's a very\nBizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there is a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the captain Han character is a writer and she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her\nHer agent calls her and said have you seen the cover and Catherine ... says no no no and so she runs to her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Catherine has a feminist and the character and and in\nThe novel a undercover there's a woman and it's like white flowing dress and a field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards a who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as they're attacking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre still solar trade for what\nIn college [noise] feminist ideologies\nAnd like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards a who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre still solar trade for what\nIn college than than its ideology is alive and I didn't have a career and then well panned out should send them the bills for our eyes and I have yes you can play soccer or if I'm going to some for our ambivalent about having a tip\n[noise]\nNo no you're not because you realize that the voters leaving the dark but\nBefore you jump changing the deadline is remember\nOh how will start as soon as I finish the play or\nRight after I get the story published I finished the book are you blaming me knowing awful you know I I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation a\nLot of women has been hit forty one I thought I could to [noise]\nI just don't think it's Gloria Steinem fault that we can't get pregnant [noise]\nI guess it is mine too busy writing my stupid book [noise]\nI didn't say that all the doctors ever talk about it's my advance\nMaternal age my old eggs in one of the middle of an ivy as an oh what a surprise your sperm it's like on a sabbatical\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose nothing\nSo that was Catherine ... and Paul Giamatti and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie\nSo all the doctors that we're talking about a lie in bed with her legs my old egg and we're in the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise your sperm it was like on a sabbatical\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose not hey\nSo that was Catherine ... and ... and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYou mean blaming myself yeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my ... and ... in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started to understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why\nShe feels betrayed by some notion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your uh\nShe feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like glorious time ever said that exactly you know she is you really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of like a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of women\nWhen you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nAway from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really you know that marriage and having babies didn't look so\nGood from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but back combined with the\nKnow pursuing a career in being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided to go to graduate school and film and trying to make films in it\nThe good from my childhood point of view so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway\nUm but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career in being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin to my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life which opens in theaters and begin streaming on Netflix this Friday after a break we'll talk more about

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but [noise] and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his\nAnd I and and then it was sort of ...

was sort of\nYou know it was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his sued and hadn't had a compulsive gambler like he was really like a character so you make three feature films two of them are about\nBeing a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film a savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing\nUm in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type [noise]\nI'm right and there isn't a strange men need between you know between the director and a father and also between the character and her brother so that is unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what\nYou've been looking at in your movies is um is family and you know the cost\nThe actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has made you so focused on the idea of family [noise]\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and\nThere were multiple said you know there was actually four children and um we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot\n[laughter] what what is your mother arrangements um when I was a teenager or at that point I had like I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living and my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother has ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me\nLive with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother has ten years older than me um had been a living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower ... high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parent\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents and we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother was you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter]\nSchool which was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter]\nThat's cool [noise] which was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place\nThat we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\n... well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like his because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um um and then when we lived with my mother she I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and\nThere was never food in the refrigerator but\nThere were things like cocktail through like olives and things that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples\nSo when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on the ... yeah ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but\nI'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off massive mhm so what was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students [noise] yeah it was really\nFor example so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on the ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off mass of mhm so what was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there were you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at the U.S you're pulling the stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that
