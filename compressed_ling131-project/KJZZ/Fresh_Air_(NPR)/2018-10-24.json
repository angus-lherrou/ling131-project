show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nWhere does your every Monday through Thursday night with the latest news analysis and your calls\nTwo weeks on tonight right now even will be getting the first results from what may be the longest midterm election cycle ever and while we haven't spent much time on this program discussing what the polls are saying we're going to dig into the numbers tonight with one of the most respected pollsters in America\nBut let's start with the news of the day with Washington Post columnist Christine MBA Christine welcome back to America on the line thanks for having me again\nThen we'll be getting the first results from what may be the longest midterm election cycle liver and while we haven't spent much time on this program discussing what the polls are saying we're going to dig into the numbers tonight with one of the most respected pollsters in America\nBut let's start with the news of the day with Washington Post columnist Christine MBA Christine welcome back to America on the line\nThanks for having me again so Christine news of the day and the big news of the day is\nThat the president once again um well actually last night declared that he's a national as much take a listen to that again\nThat wants to do well frankly not caring about our country so much and you know what we can [noise] you know they showed it became a\nNational issue and I really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nAnd today when given an opportunity to clarify what he meant ah Christine the president said it again what's going on here\nWell it's always a little bit difficult to say uh and this is actually a scary thing whether the president or actually just is ignorant um or if he knows what he's doing but in this case I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing when he calls himself a nationalized\nI'm sensibly I think he's using he says that he's using the word um to signify something sort of in the line of being America First which he said in the past um but the word nationalist specifically hasn't fallen out of you because it's old fashioned um\nOr if he knows what he's doing but in this case I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing what he calls himself a nationalist\nI'm sensibly I think he's using he says that he's using the word um to signify something sort of in the line of being America First which he said in the past\nUm but the word nationalist specifically hasn't fallen out of use because it's old fashioned I'm it's all about abuse because we now associate that with white nationalist a white supremacy and racism and I think he's using this as a dog whistle um to those\nParts of his base that yes want a America First policies but are also a little bit more interested in racism than the average voter\nAre are there in in any indicators that it is actually working is do you think that this was one of the reasons why the president's job approval rating as we talked about a lot last night has ticked up in the latest NBC News Wall Street journal poll up to fifty sorry forty seven percent\nYeah you know it's it's a bit hard to say if you know this the use of this specific word um but one of the things that we have seen in the run up to the mid term elections is that President Trump is really sort of leaning into almost the ugliest parts of his previous campaigns um yes the nationalist um\nAmerica First rhetoric a demonization of immigrants and people of color a kind of stoking fears and angers I'm among his base and his probable supporters\nAnd unfortunately as we have seen in the past several elections or anger often does more to stir voters than contentment does\nThe president is all it was also talking a lot about a middle class tax cuts that supposed to happen in a in a matter of weeks how is that possible\nI'm among his base and his probable supporters and unfortunately as we have seen in the past several elections or anger often does more to stir voters than contentment does\nThe president is ... is also talking a lot about a middle class tax cuts that supposed to happen in a in a matter of weeks how is that possible when Congress is an even in session\nIt's not possible okay [laughter] [laughter] it is not possible at all I'm\nPresident Trump has started saying this over the past out week or two um and it is confusing everybody who hears it because yes as you say Congress is not in session\nI'm the response from senators and congressmen who are asked about this as a general sense of confusion they usually try and put the question back\nTo the president and even when the president has been pushed to talk a little bit more about what this tax cut would be or what it would entail as he was a today\nWith reporters in the oval office he can't even explain what he means you know he can define what the middle classes it's not entirely clear what this ten percent would look like or what effect it would have on the deficit or who would pay for it\nBut because you know that headline is reported oh possible ten percent tax cut for the middle class it is attractive at cheers voters a and I think the president knows that that's the message that's going to go forth not the nitty gritty details like Congress being in session\nSpeaking of nitty gritty details or um other things that the president um and people in his administration have been saying or is that um\nYou know this caravan that's making its way from Central America through Mexico trying to make its way to the southern border of the U.S Mexico southern\nUh the nitty gritty details like Congress being in session\nWas speaking of nitty gritty details or um other things that the president um and people in his administration have been saying or is that um\nYou know this caravan that's making its way from Central America through Mexico trying to make its way to the southern border of the U.S Mexico southern border\nThat there are middle middle Easterners and quote\nSomewhere in the middle of this seven thousand person crowd and when push to provide any kind of back up for this ... ... the president doesn't have any ... ... ... what's going on here if you if you can it all explain\nMean honestly I think it's it's more of the same as the midterm elections are nearing and Republicans are realizing that perhaps they weren't as far ahead or as safe as they thought the president has really resorted to obvious false hoods\nI'm so yes we have this idea floated of mysterious middle class tax cuts that will appear from somewhere over the next two weeks um but then also making out this caravan\nUm which in fact happens almost every year there was also wouldn't last year and it's usually um and reporters have said you know this caravan too is of mostly families with children who have sort of banded together to try and cross the border in safety uh that's why there are large numbers\nUh this is being painted by Trump and by his vice president Mike Pence today\nAs sort of an assortment of criminals there going back to that language about you know Mexican being rapists and sending their worst the idea that they're somehow terrorists hit in in this group of people obviously there is no basis for that support\nTry and cross the border in safety uh that's why there are large numbers\nOr this is being painted by Trump and by his vice president Mike Pence today\nAs sort of an assortment of criminals there going back to that language about\nYou know Mexicans being rapists and sending their worst the idea that they're somehow terrorists hit in in this group of people\nObviously there is no basis for that support or no basis to support that but you know it's scary and again when you know we write the headlines unfortunately\nUh the headlines sake caravan it's coming or Trump says that there are terrorists and the caravan and that scares some people and that in flames his base and so it works even if there isn't a scrap of truth to it\nNow uh when I ask you about something that is close to our hearts mine mine and yours as a opinion writers at the Washington Post and that is the the brutal murder of ...\nUm here's what the president had to say in the White House speaking to reporters today about Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's sort of rolling rolling disclosure\nHer bed original concept [noise]\nIt was carried a poorly and the cover up was one of the worst and the history of cover ups for simple bad deal should've never even thought of somebody really messed up and they had the worst cover all ever\nChristine they had a very bad original concept was carried out poorly what on earth is the president of the United states saying here\n[noise] [noise] well honestly he is making it very clear that he does not care\nSomebody really messed up [noise] and they had the worst cobra ever\nChristine they had a very bad original concept was carried out poorly what on earth is the president of the United states saying here\n[noise] [noise] well honestly he is making it very clear that he does not care\nUh about journalists about this particular event um or about you know cooling any of the very close ties that he has to the Saudi Government\nI mean this is something that's actually pretty typical of Donald Trump when you think about how he you know talked about things is not particularly interested in um you know this wasn't an event to happen we see it perhaps as the death of our close colleague\nOr as an event that has really struck fear into the hearts of journalists and dissidents or around the world one of a\nA sort of rolling assortment of new and emerging threats against the free press a end to Donald Trump it's it's just a concept um it's a deal and she is weighing get you know not as the life of a person not as anything you know symbolic or important but\nWell what are the tradeoffs here or are we willing to actually risk saying anything to the Saudis about this probably not um it's an attempt to sound concerned and it's clearly not working\nUm because they keep\nFilling in um sample sizes I mean an exit polls are only the most useful when you're looking at racism cells writes ah when somebody is winning by you know some day outside the margin of error or closer races\nThe less likely the exit poll is going to be very helpful\nWell that is a very good piece of advice Jennifer Duffy from the cook Political Report thank you very much for being on America on the line and sharing your latest findings thank you we have to go to a

O T L I might tell you how I might be feeling about all this but instead we will go to Colin in Columbus ohio colon are you calling from your assignment gonna win\n... thanks for taking my call of course so\nWhere are you and the confidence scale confident and are nervous about your side Miami\nI'm nervous I'm a Democrat and I'm I just think that this whole uh the confidence in the blue wave is seen as kind of a a sluggish confidence by the right out like everyone's just so confident that the blue is going to take over more wind back the house that for failing to see like\nThe circumstances that may Trump a viable option and the first place\nSo you so you think it's sort of um over confidence of of Democrats are as\nOpposed to the president you know pulling out all the stops upped overturning all those rocks from twenty sixteen and in ... up I'm the same kind of want to call it excitement as he didn't twenty six team\nRight well of course it's all that and you know is is based get fired up on anything he does so like he basically you can't go wrong to them and so people that are trying to think here like\nWe got his ... yeah yeah [laughter] that's all right call it I Know in in in in radio it makes me nervous to call and thank you very much for calling into America on the line calling with calling in from Columbus ohio let's go further west in the mid west and go to John\nIn is calling in from Fargo North Dakota Fargo are where my husband is\nRight now full disclosure I'm helping with um center high camp or John are you confident\nYou know it makes me nervous to call and thank you very much for calling into America on the line calling was calling in from Columbus ohio let's go further west in the mid west and go to John in is calling in from Fargo North Dakota Fargo a where my husband is right now full disclosure\nI'm helping with um Central High camp a John are you confident hey how are you nervous\nI Am very confident I Want to go to shut up to ... public radio that I'm listening to the night now of course and uh I I don't believe a single\nPoll numbers or the other than for hiding ... in the past several months I don't think a national pollsters know how to pull out here uh I think a lot of farmland wines are those are the have those anymore are\nThey old conservative people out here and I don't think uh it really takes into college or whether it's a cooked whether at five thirty eight\nOr the retail politics that Heidi has been running in the campaign and ... and the way she has been representing the state in the past\nSix years so if you no matter where you go in the states or you're going to find somebody that feels like they know Heidi because she gets out into the location was she a is it from one corner of the state to the other a nonstop right and I think that hurts your ...\nSo so John I I I seem to remember that is six years ago I'm Around this time of poll came out that said that ah Heidi Heitkamp was down ten points and she came back\nWin by one point so you weren't you are confident that she can pull that out again\nOut for like All right then absolutely may uh you know I think it's going to be even given by the time when she got pulled up\nYeah I I seem to remember that six years ago I'm Around this time of whole came out that said that ah Heidi Heitkamp was down ten points and she came back to win by one point so you are you are confident\nThat she can pull that out again\nShortly alright that out for you know I think it's going to be given by ... up on official found sixteen points uh last certainly like Atlanta on air from great communication which is one of the corporation fat buying up all of the\n... the affiliates and turn them into little many a Fox News outlets I'm so that it's going to be a\nI don't think we're going to know until election night but I definitely don't believe those kinds of polls are out of state\nJohn thank you very much for calling in from Fargo North Dakota now it's time to bring in the ... if you've been paying attention to the campaign news you may have noticed a darker scarier tune in the last week or so we're just a few weeks ago the battles were being fought over who would or would not protect Americans with preexisting conditions\nNow it's about President Trump vowing that he and Republicans will protect Americans from lawless moms in the streets and Middle Eastern terrorists sneaking over the southern border Trump was asked asked again today whether there's any proof this\nThey say happens all the time in the middle east even say what's the real bad ones but there will be interesting to me there's there's no proof of anything\n[noise] there was no proof of anything maybe a sentence that describes a lot of what the president says but is it a winning strategy joining me now to talk about President Trump's increasingly fear based campaign strategy is Philip bump national correspondent at the watts\nBut there is a good very well me there's no anything\nThere's no proof of anything maybe a sentence that describes a lot of what\nThe president says but is it a winning strategy joining me now to talk about President Trump's increasingly pure based campaign strategy is Philip bump national correspondent at the Washington Post in here in Studio with me is Jamie Floyd legal affairs correspondent for WNYC thank you both very much for being on America on the line\nSo Philip can you ... and you've written about this ... ... is it really is\nAs simple as it seems the reason why in the closing weeks of the midterm campaign that the president is turning increasingly to a fear based campaign\nI'm probably I mean it's sort of you know I I'm generally lows describe really nuanced\nPolitical strategy to President Trump for a variety of reasons but I mean I think that not only does that make sense as an explanation particularly given the way that he has spoken about this when he tweeted a just yesterday or day prior to that\nYou know essentially that the caravan was an issue that that you need to vote against the Democrats because of these these people who are of approaching\nThe border I mean he's been explicit in saying that he is doing this for political reasons but as I wrote yesterday I mean this is also the third election cycle and World War we've seen Republicans really braces this\nStrategy directly numbers and twenty four team some race of people on these long state has issue that they want it to the gym people up on them twenty sixteen Trump Braniff entire campaign on this idea that America was under threat that immigrants with terrorists were or for for storming our shores and then all of it is none of it came came to fruition obviously for a variety of reasons but\nThis was this has been playbook pretty consistently\nOr a strategy directly there was a twenty four teams so worrisome people on Islamic state as he wanted the search and people from them for granted and her campaign on this idea that America was\nUnder threat that immigrants with her for for for storing our shores and then all of this none of it came before should obviously for a variety of reasons but this was this has been played pretty consistently\nMostly because they're not storming our shores [laughter] I mean the\nThey go low we go lower that that's the Trump approach to things President Trump approach to things and you know we've been here before I I've been a Jonathan spending much of my year in Nineteen sixty eight why would anyone want to go back to that turbulent year well because it's less\nTurbulent than this you know why I'm there but\nBut interestingly President Nixon president next and this is a page out of the Nixon play ball and and you know eat I cannot I you know much like fill up my I I find it rather hard to believe that\nDonald Trump is spent much time reading uh biographies and and uh papers of of Richard Nixon\nBut if you go back to the the a playbook of Nixon\nDuring a time when we had the voting rights act the civil rights act a rise in liberalism and and and uh a feeling of a of of a ... a concern amongst a a wide sectors of the population\nAh that that we should perhaps\nA protect our white women and protect our our borders and concern ourselves with the other a President Nixon used fear of the bombing is\nCERN amongst a a wide sectors of the

states have made it for some of their citizens to vote\nIn Georgia for example were fifty three thousand bell of applications are in limbo because of a new law and other states like North Dakota Kansas Ohio having an acted laws that make it especially difficult for minority students and the elderly to vote\nFor former attorney general Eric Holder making it easier for people to vote and to have their votes count has become his life's work he heads the national\nDemocratic redistricting committee and we sat down to talk about how it's going\nThe applications are in limbo because of a new law and other states like North Dakota Kansas Ohio having an acted laws that make it especially difficult for minority students and the elderly to vote\nFor former attorney general Eric Holder making it easier for people to vote and to have their votes count has become his life's work he heads the national\nDemocratic redistricting committee and we sat down to talk about how it's going\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder welcome to America on the line it's good to be here thanks for having me so Democrats are focused on winning back the house but you're focused on winning legislative and gubernatorial races\nWhy well uh I first say that I think Democrats for too long hair focused on the top of the ticket the federal level\nUm without understanding where it without remembering that are on a day to day basis people's lives will probably greater more impacted by what happens at the state and local level and so in terms of impacting people's lives that's why I think we should focus there but also as the chair of the national democratic redistricting committee\nUm focus on the state and local level so that we can make sure that we have people at the table when redistricting is done in twenty Twenty one\nUh who are committed to fare redistricting and that is determined by who will be a ... and the governor's races who will win on the governors' races and who will ah when these um state legislative races\nOr ... ... talk about the significance of twenty Twenty one it has to do with the census\nWhile the census has been twenty twenty and we want to make sure we have a fair census but after one year after the census occurs a redistricting occurs in twenty Twenty one\nAnd then as a process controlled by the state legislatures so how many state legislatures right now legislatures and governors mansions are controlled by Democrats [noise]\nUm I don't know the exact number but the over ... they're pretty ...\nWell the census has been twenty twenty and we want to make sure we have a fair census but after one year after the census occurs a redistricting occurs in twenty Twenty one\nAnd that is a process controlled by the state legislatures so how many state legislatures right now legislatures and governors mansions are controlled by Democrats [noise]\nUm I don't know the exact number but the over ... they're pretty substantial number that are controlled by Republicans and our my hope is that in twenty Eighteen will start the reversal of that trend\nContinue it through twenty twenty so that when you get to twenty Twenty one you have Democrats at the table both at the gubernatorial level and at the state legislative level\nNow in in the twenty Eighteen elections you're targeting twelve states I'm I'm not that includes Nineteen legislative chambers three ballot initiatives and six down ballot races those are very specific\nNumbers can you talk about the the the significance of say the six down ballot races\nWhat we're trying to do is do we have done is to look to the fifth estate analysis\nAnd in trying to determine how we can have the greatest impact on the redistricting process we identify twelve states and then um races within those states that are critical\nGovernors always matter um state legislative races matter a great deal um but when it comes to Ohio for instance the state auditor matters a great deal with regard to a fair redistricting the state secretary of state in Ohio I'm In certain states the Supreme Court matters more than a dozen other places and that's why we\nSupport the candidate in was in a special election in Wisconsin with regard to a state Supreme Court seat we're supporting Anita Earls who's running for a state Supreme Court in North Carolina\nSo we're really targeted focused on those races they will have the greatest impact and ensure a fair redistricting process\nState in Ohio I'm In certain states the Supreme Court matters more than a dozen other places and that's why we supported the candidate in was in a special election in Wisconsin with regard to a state Supreme Court seat where I'm supporting Anita Earls who's running for a state Supreme Court in North Carolina\nSo we're really targeted focused on those races they will have the greatest impact and ensure a fair redistricting process come uh twenty Twenty one\nNow you mentioned the position of secretary of state and right now there's one secretary of state and protected or who's in the news and That's Brian Kemp secretary of state in Georgia who is also the Republican gubernatorial nominee\nRight he's the guy who is a player and a game and wants to be the umpire in the game at the same time and this is a fundamental front I think to our sense of a democracy and simple fairness he should resign as secretary of state he should resign he shouldn't simply recuse he should resign I mean uh in other races where\nAh in the past where secretary of state have run for governor more often than not to secretary of state has recused himself or herself\nOr and what recourse is there if he if he doesn't resign and come election day they're irregularities or there are concerns about the vote in Georgia\nWell you know a first I'd say that people have to go get to the polls and um [noise] irrespective of\nWhat the ... they might be saying in the newspapers or the the propaganda that they're trying to put out there people need to get to the polls demand a ballot go with the appropriate them id and a demand the ability to to cast to cast a vote\nThere also lawsuits that are undoubtedly have been filed and I'm sure it will be filed to ensure again that a fair process a curse not only in Georgia but in other states as well um can efforts like\nPropaganda that they are trying to put out there people need to get to the polls demand a ballot go with the appropriate um ID and demand the ability to to cast to cast their votes\nThey're also lawsuits that are undoubtedly have been filed and I'm sure it will be filed to ensure again that a fair process a curse not only in Georgia but in other states are as well\nUm can efforts like at the ... those that are happening in Georgia\nThe voter intimidation aspect of it why isn't there a ... grader outcry in terms of the um the knock on the the fairness of it all\nWell I think that you know there is a growing awareness of the unfairness of it all when you look at what's happened in North Dakota with regard to Native Americans or when you look at what's going on in Georgia with regard to those I guess fifty three thousand or so [noise] um registrations that are simply sitting on I'm Brian Kemp desk\nThere is a growing awareness among the American people that are electoral process is not being conducted in a fair way I'm Kris Kobach who's running for governor [noise] I'm In Kansas has kind of lead the way here using his secretary of state position in that state's\nThe national um attention that he got when he was part of that ill fated\nAmong electoral commission that a President Trump put together that collapsed of two of its own weight [noise]\nUm I think people are really focused on the fact that\nIn too many places um our electric or elections are not being conducted in um in in a fair way with the California model be a better way to go and do you think not nonpartisan election yeah I actually think and I think the ... is the view of the NPR see as well\nThat's the best way to do the redistricting process was to do it as they do it in Arizona and in California\nWhere you take it out of the hands of politicians altogether\nThe fact that in too many places are electric or elections are not being conducted in um in in a fair way with the California model be a better way to go do you think not nonpartisan election yeah I actually think and I think the state is the view of the NPR see as well\nThat the best way to do the redistricting process was to do it as they do it in Arizona and in California\nWhere you take it out of the hands of politicians altogether and you simply have these independent redistricting commission so I'm drawing the lines\nIn too many places now we have a system where politicians are picking their voters instead of voters decided who their representatives are going to be and that's why the national democratic redistricting committee exactly supporting these ballot initiatives that would create a independent commissions in Michigan Missouri Colorado in Utah\nNow we were talking about Georgia before and I want to come back to Georgia because that I Would like for you to talk about the comment heard around the world and that was when you said when they go low we kick 'em and you did say you didn't mean anything inappropriate or or illegal\nBut it took on a life of its own instantly\nIt do your critics have a point or are they desperate\nBut it took on a life of its own because Republicans tried to make something of it more than it was it was a metaphor or and what I was essentially trying to say was that\nUm Democrats specifically the American people more generally need to be tough and fight against those people are those entities that would try to undermine our democracy or Republicans tried to make a great deal of\nThat remark in an attempt to put up a distraction so that people will focus on the fact that of the ways in which they're trying to conduct these elections
