Emily Hi amber thanks for joining America on the line tonight\nI Am or we all know how Trump instead putting denies involvement in the twenties sixteen election as just putting as a credible source and maybe it was a four hundred pound hacker sitting on his couch and since that's been affected for him I guess listen to the similarities\nWith what he said this morning about the evidence that the Saudi Government had killed your colleague ...\nFriendly denied any knowledge of it\nReally know maybe I I don't want to get engaged fine but it sounded to me like maybe they should have been road\nWe're going to try getting to the bottom of it very should have a flat denial\nThat the Saudi Government had killed your college ...\nRegime denied any knowledge of it\nReally know maybe I don't want to get by but it sounded to me like maybe the\nWe're going to get to the bottom of a diversion but it was a flat denial\nFlattened NATO who knows ...\nYeah that you're exactly right it parallels what Trump has been saying for years now at this point on whether Russia meddled in the ... election just Sunday he told CBS is likely style you know Russia they metal ... I think trying to meddle too\nI'm In in much more domestically we've seen the president give\nMen in his orbit accused of behaving badly the benefit of the doubt even when others in his party don't want to stand by that I'm thinking in particular Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race that Republicans lost last year um\n... the question is why the presidency very willing to give anyone he wants to stand by the benefit of the doubt\nTake them at their word the question again is why\n... ... yeah well what do you think\nOh I'm Sorry the question for me not at my college I feel I I was going to transition there but then he gave me such an interesting Marshall to follow up on\nRight yeah I it it ... it depends on the situation it very clear in the examples that followed more closely here at home of men accused of behaving badly in his orbit when people are politically beneficial\nTo him he wants to stick with those people he doesn't want to drop them um diplomatically I see a similar mindset in terms of ...\nIt it depends on the situation is very clear in the examples that followed more closely here at home of men accused of eating badly in his orbit when people are cool ethically beneficial\nTo him he wants to stick with those people he doesn't want to drop them um diplomatically I see a similar mindset in terms of him thinking of\nDiplomacy is relationship\nHe always talks about how much she likes Xi Jinping in China you invite 'em or we can get along in in Mexico the incoming president ... they like each other and it's all about like the kind of surface level relationship and so I'm Wondering if that has something to do here with\nHis inability to say no to strong men which he's also said several times during the campaign he'd Myers\nEmily in fairness to Trump two things one\nThe Saudis can buy weapons from our adversaries China and Russia like Trump says if we cut off of themselves as punishment\nFor this possible murder or some people are calling for maybe that's not the right sanctions and two American presidents for nearly a century less we forget our history our recent history\nHave been looking the other way while the Saudi Government commits all kinds of human rights atrocities mostly for the sake of cheap oil to support or consumer lifestyles\nSo do you think Trump's ... up to the Saudis is different and either kind doing degree in any way\nI think in the green it's different though I think you're absolutely right tried mine does have that history and there's a general reluctance on the part of American leaders chat\nTo call the Saudi doubt on tape and useful to us and so I'm an African leaders tend to have to be forced into taking an adversary opposition parts Saudi Arabia but this is\nDifferent and he looked kind or an degree in any way\n[noise] I think in the green it's different though I think you're absolutely right or on mine does have that history you know there's a general reluctance on the part of American leaders to\nTo call the Saudis doubt on they've been useful to us and so I'm American leaders tend to have to be forced into taking an adversarial position for Saudi Arabia but this is such a frightening and um [noise]\nYou know blatant disregard for human rights that I think Trump has felt at least somewhat on the defensive in the last few days and it's looking of wrote killers which is an explanation that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut says that the Saudis themselves are trying to circulate\nYou know that sort of by the Saudi line we don't have any sense of travel about why he thinks that's a plausible accusation and I think he's very um committed and the past often successful and kind of floating these\nFairly implausible excuses for people doing what looked like to be really terrible things and the uncertainty itself right the kind of who knows at such a tell with him then it becomes\nYou have one more unanswered question that people can make up conspiracy theories about\nThan when he says maybe it was real killers that sounds implausible because it sounds like strangers whooping into the Saudi embassy understandable\nTo go after Mr ... but now we have reports and several news organizations that the Saudi Government itself who's going to ... um this was an ... edition of ... gone bad\nThen they weren't supposed to kill him and ... the Saudis kind of in conjunction with Trump or ... some of their own people up to be for guys wrote killers\nYeah that's exactly right on your situation where Trump is giving this\nNow the government itself is going to say um this was an interrogation of cars so gee gone bad and they weren't supposed to kill him and so amber it sounds like the Saudis kind of in conjunction with Trump setting some of their own people up to be for guys wrote killers\nYeah that's exactly right on your situation where Trump is giving the Saudis and a lot of wiggle room to try to get out of whatever it is turkey is closing in on because the Saudis are preparing their own report which is likely to be ... skepticism and the international community\nTurkey is I I doubt to any minute now according to report to go into the consulate in search they released a video that jet\nA team of Saudi agents I you know of course when it stand bolt and tried to capture could show geek\nSo on the on the other side of the Saudi Arabia trying to say exactly as you said it wasn't our outer edge and Trump is giving them so much room to to make that case\nLet's move to the Elizabeth one story and by way of background she has come under fire from Trump and others for putting down on a professional profile\nThat she has Native American blood she did that once upon a time she grew up in Oklahoma and says that was family lore about some Indian heritage Trump uses to argue she's a phoney and has challenged her to take a DNA test well guess what this morning senator want revealed she did say such a test\nThe test a at Stanford University did not know whose DNA he was examining and there was apparently a Native American ancestor six to ten generations ago so here's part of the video that senator one released with the tester Stanford University professor of biomedical data\nWell guess what this morning senator one revealed she did say such a tough\nThe tester at Stanford University did not know whose DNA he was examining and there was apparently a Native American ancestor six to ten generations ago so here's part of a video\nThat Senator Warren released with the toaster Stanford University professor of biomedical science and genetics Carlos ... center\nAnd the hunger genome did far far from a\nTree with very high confidence we believe the euro raiders love someone from now the president wants to call my mom a liar what are the facts I sure would we are committed murder interest or your\nCue the sentimental music I don't know if it's indigenous music or not but Emily what do you make of the scientific legitimacy of a test if you can make anything of it and what about the political implications for this potential twenty twenty presidential candidate\nSaying that their parties should have been tough on Bill Clinton and essentially disagreeing with Hillary Clinton and so I sent you were really litigating this all over again even with the Clintons that the political culture um but in a way that dividing the Democratic party so I think that does matter it's not something they're going to let go\nAmber Phillips politics goes London for the Washington Post thank you so much for joining us

Bush won reelection and the very close two thousand four presidential election because Republicans put an anti gay marriage question on the ballot in the ultimate swing states that year of Ohio\nThat drove Republican turnout and Bush won by a hair so ballot questions matter times to not only does one from the New York times magazine wrote last month about the Florida ex felons question and she is still with us Emily ... background\nHow does that even become a thing in the United states of all the punishments for felonies large or small why did some states include losing your right to vote for the rest of your life\nThat's a great question the law that I'm permanently disenfranchised former felons started in the early Nineteen century in states like Connecticut and they seem to have been you know a kind of punishment maybe as sort of puritan idea of on continuing punishment\nBut they really take off on during reconstruction in the south\nAnd what we see there and it's really clear from the history is that as southern states were forced to give 'em black people to vote in order to re entered a union because that was the terms for re entering the union\nThey also tried to reduce the political power of the same people who are getting the vote and one of their tools\nTake off on during reconstruction in the south\nAnd what we see there and it's really clear from the history is that as southern states were forced to give 'em black people to vote in order to re entered a union because that was the terms for re entering the union they also tried to reduce the political power of the same people who are getting the vote\nAnd one of their tools was to permanently disenfranchise you if you had a felony conviction\nUm the states in the south including Florida they pass those permanent disenfranchised bands and then they included crimes like petty larceny\nIn the meantime there are actually also rounding up a lot of African American former slaves for crimes like larceny I'm often without really any proof and they were putting these people in prison and then leasing them as laborers to plantations\nSo you see this sort of double blow here where you're both imprisoning lots of people who were formerly enslaved and then using that as an excuse to take away the vote for them forever\nSo listeners will open up the phones on this one\nWho among you thinks that a felony conviction should cost some on the road to vote\nFor the rest of their laws rather than until they've served their time\nAnd who thinks otherwise give us a call from Florida or wherever a aid for for seven four or five talk aid for for seven four or five to five five anyone want to tell your own story along these lines with out of a loved one or just your opinion\nIf you've ever thought about it maybe if you've never thought about it and you're hearing this\nAre you thinking a ban on him for the rest of their lives or what people can vote for the rest of the lawyer ... even after they've served their time\nFor some and four or five to four or five\nAnyone want to tell your own story along these lines with out of a loved one\nOr just your opinion if you've ever thought about it maybe if you've never thought about it and you're hearing this are you thinking a ban on him for the rest of their lives or what people can vote for the rest of the lawyer ... even after they've served their time\nFor for seven four or five talk the four four southern four or five the too far for\nYour article says Florida alone has a quarter of all the disenfranchised felons in the U.S how did that come to be\n[noise] you know there are just a lot of people who get prison sentences in Florida and it's now the third biggest state\nAnd so what you wind up with our number showing up more than one point five million people are permanently disenfranchised in Florida um that's one in ten of 'em all voters and one in five African American voters\nSo we're still seeing a kind of racial imbalance in the impact that this law has\nObviously this was part isn't too or those ex felons disproportionately and demographics that would tend to vote for Democrats\n[noise] yeah probably I mean if there's some debate over death but it does seem like because I'm about thirty percent of them are African Americans and African Americans in Florida\nVote for Democrats at a rate of about Ninety percent\nThat there could be some partisan advantage to Democrats if this and then the passes but I should say that it's not totally clear because it's also possible that the people who've been out for a longer maybe more likely to register and vote and those people tend to be white and tend to register\nAt reasonably high rates as Republicans and independents\nSo it's possible that this is not going to be

Arizona talk to you\nIs not going to be some you know huge a turn Florida blue tool and that you know the argument that people are passing the amendment want to make is that this is just a tool of citizenship it's like you know a debt pay that status paid people should be able to have a second chance and that\nVoting is tied to people feeling like full citizens and there is an interesting research suggesting that be getting the vote back may um correlate with people being less likely to re offend so we could also take that benefit into account and evaluating this amendment\nIn fact I've read that the rationale for only allowing white men who own property to vote at the founding of this country the property part\nWas about the idea that you have to have a stake in the economic well being of the nation to vote responsibly it's so the opposite of how we tend to think today right that the wealthy use their influence to shape the law law to hoard the wealth for themselves\nAnd so arguably nobody has more of a stake in the economic future of their communities today than than many men who were convicted of felonies in the era of mass incarceration which might be ending ... is that to historically abstract for politics or anything like that getting set in Florida\nI think you're right people are making these abstract arguments about citizenship and second chances and\nBelonging and I think one reason is you know tactical this amendment has to pass by sixty percent to become law in Florida because it involves demanding the state constitution and they have their super majority requirement for\nTo historically abstract for politics or anything like that getting shut in Florida\nI think you're right people are making these abstract arguments about citizenship and second chances and\nBelonging and I think one reason is you know tactical this and then that has to pass by sixty percent to become law in Florida because it involves demanding the state constitution and they have this super majority requirement for doing that\nI think there's also a kind of deeper commitment on the part of the\nYou know most of the people who are leading the effort here are former felons themselves and I think they feel like there is something deep at stake here about\nWho they are about you know recognizing that they've done their time and that they want to lead to a different kind of life and that they deserve to be part of picking on the elected representation for their communities\nLet's take a phone call Jason in St Louis you're on America on the line or Jason\nHi how you doing tonight good what do you think uh\nI'm thinking that I'm actually in favor of ex cons and so and not being allowed to vote because when they enter the workforce critical themselves as the previous a con they lose the right to own and have a fire or um\n[noise]\nThis is ...

they've been kind of a pioneer and a number of ... plus I'm writes\nUm it's one thing to fight over adding new rights it's another thing to consider taking rights away who wasn't happy with the application of transgender rights in Massachusetts\nSo ah in twenty six teen the actual Republican governor Charlie Baker signed legislation that extended protections to transgender individuals in

birth\nSo transgender roads my goal was this ballot measure succeeds in Massachusetts and Oregon might repeal it sanctuary state status\n[noise] yes so uh Oregon has the oldest a so called sanctuary state law that was implemented in Nineteen eighty seven\nAnd obviously sanctuary laws have been a contentious topic and\nThe Trump Administration has actually taken legal action against states and cities that have implemented these policies so it'll be really interesting to see whether voters ah uphold these policies are if they'll repeal their\n... and do you happen to know I mean that's the

Medicaid expansion questions and for red states Montana Nebraska Idaho and Utah all going to vote on basically expanding Medicaid as laid out an Obamacare\nYeah so our health care reporter Maddy ... has been following this more closely but just to give you an overview as you said these four states will be voting on whether to expand Medicaid\nA which has been a central part of Iraq Obama's Affordable Care act\nBetter known as Obamacare um this is going to be really the first test for Medicaid expansion since congressional Republicans tried and failed to repeal it only one state so far

just go ahead what's on the ballot in the white\nWell there was a a a measure that is a little conflicting for me it's two out of surcharge on investment property is a it was originally geared for people who live out of state or out of the country and buy properties here um\n\nFor investment purposes and then they pay rent them out or something like that and then he was helping to drive up the price of housing and it's supposed to be to fund education to the phones are supposed to your markets earmarked for education\nThere are two problems with the bill though or at least\nOne is that there is nothing that says the legislature can't reduce their general funds for education by whatever they take it on the transient or or on the investment tax and then the other is that it was originally written should be on property has worked over a million dollars\nUm that was removed in the final draft of the bill\nSo for all the people on the mainland\nOne is that there's nothing that says the legislature care reduce their general firms are for education by whatever they take it off the transient or or the ... that's ... ... and then the other is that it was originally written should be on property has worked over a million dollars\nUm that was removed the final draft of the bill\nSo so for all the people are on the mainland whose eyes are blazing over in head just spinning going what or who gets hurt by this that makes you leaning it sounds like you're against a ... you you want to do some measure\nEvery once in a row house\nStefan thank you very much coil it down to super ... that the end there and let's go to Elaine in St Louis highly your automatic on the line\nElaine you there\nOh I'm Sorry Karen in Columbus ohio carrying around America on the line we have
