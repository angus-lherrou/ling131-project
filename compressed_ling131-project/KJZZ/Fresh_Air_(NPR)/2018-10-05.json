Phoenix the candidates are Democrat Kathy Hoffman and Republican Frank rigs\nThe format for the debate is as follows the candidates will get up to two minutes each to give an opening and closing statement we ask questions that we prepared and questions from the audience the aim of the event was to have a conversation we told the candidates their answers would not be limited after the opening statements and then we we do our very best to be sure they each got roughly the same amount of time to talk\nWe asked him to stick the policy and avoid discussion as much as possible about the campaign itself or personal attacks [noise] all\nRight so we uh drew numbers are at a time for the order of the opening statement ah mysteries we'll go first for the opening statement we'll swap that order or for the closing statement so ... do you have two minutes who had\nThe job of super attended a public construction is two fold it requires the high level executive leadership of the Arizona department of education it's seven hundred plus and dedicated employees in the core mission\nOf the department which is to implement and administer all state and federal policies and programs for K. twelve education in our state\nIt also entails the management of almost ten billion dollars in local state and federal funding that we spent on K. twelve education ... in our state and the other part of the job is what I Would call the bully pulpit\nIt's the soft power the office the power of persuasion the ability to influence\nLegislation and policy in our state and served as the chief advocate for parents students educators the business community of course and last but certainly not least taxpayers in general I have a proven record over Thirty years of\nExecutive educational and legislative leadership\nIt's legislation and policy in our state and service the chief advocate for parents students educators the business community of course and last but certainly not least taxpayers in general\nI have a proven record over Thirty years of executive educational and legislative leadership [noise]\nI also believe I'm ideally prepared for the responsibilities of superintendent of public instruction at a time when we're at a critical juncture in Arizona K. twelve education and frankly where we've been lacking strong leadership\nFor the last four years I have high level executive leadership experience and skills I have a deep knowledge of education policies and practices at the local state and federal level as a former United States congressman and chairman of the house of representatives subcommittee on early childhood\nElementary and secondary education and I got the proven ability to get things done in the legislative and political arena all of those skills\nI think are necessary there should there my strong suits but I think they're necessary to being a credible effective and successful superintendent of public instruction and I very much look forward to our discussion tonight\nThey give me his health and your two minutes\nAnd when I say thank you everyone for being here thank you to our hosts\nStephen K days easy my privilege to be here again my name is Cathy Hoffman and for those who don't know me my journey into politics began over a year and a half ago when I was watching the confirmation hearing about it a boss\nAnd that's when I realized that we

know me my journey into politics began over a year and a half ago when I was watching the confirmation hearing about it a boss\nAnd that's when I realized that we must\nHave more educators running for office if we want to see any kind of benefit for our public schools for me that was the tipping point and I'm proud to be one of many strong democratic women running for office here in Arizona and one of many teacher ... a third plus a record number of teachers\nWho have stepped up to fight for public education in Arizona\nI worked in my entire professional career in Arizona Public schools first in the veil school district in Tucson and more recently in the Peoria school district and as a speech therapist I've worked with students\nAcross all grade levels and all ability levels\nMany of the students I've worked with have a developmental disability such as autism or Down syndrome some of the students I worked with just have trouble staying there ours are they're S's are the speech sounds some of my students have had reading literacy difficulties are learning challenges\nAnd I've even worked with students who are gifted so truly worked with students across the entire spectrum and through this role I've had countless conversations with parents and teachers and as a team we work together to find solutions\nTo meet the needs of all of our students across all all grade levels and no matter\nWhat the circumstances are no matter the background of our children and I know as an educator that Arizona future starts in our schools and the real experts of education are educators I look forward to hearing more of my ideas that the here tonight thank you\nWith one of the biggest issues in education in the state which is education funding and there was a lot there we want to talk about about that particular topic but what's her was\nI've our children and I know as an educator that Arizona future starts in our schools and the real experts of education\nAre educators I look forward to hearing more of my idea is that the here tonight thank you\nAll right so let's start with one of the biggest issues in education in the state which is education funding and there's a lot that we want to talk about about that particular topic but what's art was sort of a basic question we want to hear from each of you\nWhether you think there is enough money in the state government in the public education system right now does the state\nHave enough money for education as often we don't\nKnow it is not Arizona has cut more from public schools than any other state in that country and I have seen firsthand that devastating effects of it and\nThe truth is I Know what our students are capable of when we gave them the resources to be successful\nI've had tunes that need and I had to communicate I seen classrooms that have high technology\nOr a ... a career and technical education programs where they're teaching our students how to do welding skills are graphic design and so I've seen what our students are capable of when they have all the learning opportunities that they need\nAnd we absolutely must solve this funding crisis it's also related directly to our teacher shortage crisis\nWe absolutely must find a sustainable revenue source to fully fund public education in Arizona\nMysteries do you think there's enough money and say government to adequately one let's let's stipulate first of all that education funding was flat in our state for almost a decade due to the great recession\nAnd over that ten year period we're adding over a ... seven hundred thousand new residents in the state which resulted in a Seventy thousand shooting enrollment increasing our K ... schools the net effect of that\nWas of course more people funded or per pupil funding I should say in ...\nOf all that education funding was flat in our state for almost a decade due to the great recession and over that ten year period we're adding over seven hundred thousand new residents in the state which resulted in a Seventy thousand shooting enrollment increase in our K ... schools the net effect of that\nWas of course lower people funding or per pupil funding I should say and larger class sizes but\nI think we have been making strides under governor do seas leadership and frankly through legislative action as well that it's been almost ... along straight party lines with virtually no democratic support\nIn the state legislature it's important to point out what is in the current state fiscal year budget\nIt invested over seven hundred million and new funding for K. twelve education it added resources to increase average teacher pay by twenty percent by twenty twenty that's the governor's twenty by twenty twenty proposal\nThis quite stone average arrays of Ninety seven hundred dollars and represents a one billion dollar investment over the next three years it restored a hundred million in additional assistance for school supplies and capital which was reduced during the great recession\nAnd it included a hundred and Ninety million and inflation and growth money that can be used for additional supplies increasing pay for any staff teacher\nAnd non teacher alight recognizing that our school support personnel perform a very valuable role in making every school a good learning community and last but certainly not least it allocated a hundred and thirty nine million for new school construction and building repairs\nThat all said we have devout never never again to allow per pupil funding our our base level of K. twelve education funding which is the single biggest item in the state general fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween district in charter schools between large metropolitan districts and rural districts between high wealth\nDistricts that has to say districts will high property values within the boundaries and the converse low wealth a districts\nAnd I want to approach that with the idea of putting everything on the table in terms of how we can better fund our schools\nCritical though is for the business community to step up and have more skin in the gay I've traveled the state for the last year and a half forty thousand miles\nAnd everywhere I've gone employer's business owners have told me as a former CEO who can walk the talk have told me they're concerned about the lack of qualified job applicants\nI'm convinced hopefully through taking the carrot approach and using incentives that we can get the private sector to play a larger role\nThe last year and a half forty thousand miles\nAnd everywhere I've gone employer's business owners have told me as a former CEO who can walk the talk have told me they're concerned about the lack of qualified job applicants\nI'm convinced hopefully through taking the dirt approached and using incentives that we can get the private sector to play a larger role in funding arcade twelve schools we can do that through an incentive a tax credit perhaps for apprenticeships\nMentor ships in Torrance internships on the job training collaboration with our secondary in post secondary institutions to better align crude technical education with the real needs them opportunities with the workforce\nSo I think there's a lot of work to be done I intend to lead that I think the governor will be happy for me to lead that initiative and the other initiative on I'm going to lead is on school safety because obviously because of my law enforcement background I think that um ideally prepared to assume the leadership of that initiative and I have to think\nThat school security and the safety of our students in our educators is the top priority for the superintendent of public instruction\nBack to that question of caffeine in the classroom sizes file that would be an ideal situation to Catholic high can find this\nWe are faced with a reality that we have over Fifteen hundred vacant teaching positions and that doesn't even take into account the number of long term substitutes that are in our classroom teaching as well and as much as they are very valued entering class\nAnd out there I'm not hearing very valuable and they're they're kind of meeting that needed ... when we do have vacancies\nBut that the issue here is um when we have so many vacancies we need to get to the root of the problem is the issue is not a shortage of teachers with their certificates that issue and we have not made teaching an attractive place to work and we're not doing everything we can to lessen their workload makes\nClass I Know there's been a very valuable and their their ... meeting that in the universities and we do have vacancies\nBut that that issue here is um let me have so many vacancies we need to get to the root of the problem the issue is not a shortage of teachers with their certificates\nThe issue is we have not made teaching an attractive place to work and we're not doing everything we can\nTo lessen their workload making sure they have the benefits as I mentioned before\nTalking about work low and making sure that there's instructional age to support our teachers\nMaking sure that if a teacher does how does need to take a sick day that than there is a substitute there to teach their class we have just a multitude of issues that make it very challenging for our teachers to stay in the classroom and I'm just amazed at the teachers who had stayed and who are so dedicated all of our veteran teachers I'm very grateful for their work and dedication\n[noise] her let's move on to another issue one which we've alluded to but I wanted to get a little deeper in\nThe superintendent of public construction position is in many ways sort of get ministry of um you don't get to set a lot of polls you're not a lawmaker of you know it is an elected position obviously but\nWe want to get deer from each of you how you view this position what sort of the role of it is and what would be the most important things in the job that you were doing was homeless or with you on a\nYeah so I Want to um highlight again that as an educator anyone who's been in a classroom knows that a large part of being an educator and being a teacher is largely administrative we're constantly doing paper are constantly scheduling meetings meeting with people from all backgrounds and\nAnd further since I have worked in special education and I have been working in multiple different school settings I Know from the ground up the complexities of our public education system and the ... and the complexities within each individual school and as I've traveled a state I've ... I've seen this even more such as the differences\nPaperwork for constantly scheduling meetings meeting with people from all backgrounds and\nAnd further and since I have worked in special education and I have been working in multiple different school settings I Know from the ground up the complexities of our public education system and the ... and the complexities within each individual school and as I've traveled to stay I mean I've seen this even more\nSuch as the differences between a a rural school perhaps out and show low compared to an urban school right here like the furious school district or I worked and so what I intend to do is bring that educator voice to our department of education\nAnd continue to collaborate with people make sure that everybody all the stakeholders people um educators from around the state feel that they have a voice and the department of education and also one thing that has been greatly missing from our department of education over the past few years\nI don't know for how long is we don't hear enough positive we all we hear all these negative or schools are broken and and it's a piece of directing ... situations which is true we need to talk about that as well but when we don't talk about the positives all the amazing programs we have in our schools bilingual programs\nI Hogan forever teaching our kids coating when we don't talk about the amazing programs and amazing achievements of our teachers\nThen I Wonder why would anyone want to invest in our schools\nAnd why would anyone want to work in our schools and so when my priorities as superintendent of public instruction will be to make sure that I Am a strong advocate of public education both with the public with the legislature with the governor and make sure that I'm always fighting for the future of our children and our school\nEggs how do how do you view the office had to do the job well I think are spoke to that my opening comments are but to respond to the to the question was is as I mentioned elected school board member two years was board president was the end\nAnd well me to make sure that I Am a strong advocate of public education both with the public with the legislature with the governor and make sure that I'm always fighting for the check out our children and our school\nMr eggs how do how do you view the office how you view the job well I think I spoke to that in my opening comments are but to respond to the to the question I was as as I mentioned elected school board member two years this is for president I was the individual ultimately responsible\nFor all operations in personnel the growing school district and and by the way that was in California where teachers have tenure after one year so we had some very very contentious administrative hearings\nWith respect to each teacher disciplinary procedures and and actually disciplinary action against classified employees because the employees had the right to appeal to the board and the board then acted as a cause I judicial body [noise]\nI also built a national education nonprofit from a start up to a hundred and twenty five million an assets\nAre working with non profit charter schools in the inner cities of America that sort of predominantly low income student populations and communities where the traditional schools district schools had failed generations of urban schoolchildren\nBuilt that from a start up to a hundred and twenty five million in assets\nI also have deep legislative and political experience and I and I you know I'll just say one example I mentioned earlier I DEA the individual disability Education Act of Nineteen Ninety seven\nThat was a law on the books that badly needed reform and updating Congress has a unique ability to keep programs alive even after the authorization of those programs has expired they do that by continuing to fund the programs to enable appropriations\nThat's one reason why we have ... trillion dollar national debt today which is the biggest threat to our children and grandchildren's future\nNineteen Ninety seven that was a law on the books that badly needed reform and updating Congress has a unique ability to keep programs alive even after the authorization of those programs has expired they do that by continuing to fund the programs to Angela procreation\nThat's one reason why we have ... trillion dollar national debt today which is the biggest threat to our children are grandchildren's future by far that said when I became chairman of the subcommittee my first priority was to negotiate the revision in reauthorization of that legislation\nThat did that on a bike camera and bipartisan basis I sat down with the late Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts the youngest of the legendary\nKennedy brothers who was the chief Senate negotiator on that legislation and in a week's time only backup for just seconds say Centre county taught me a very valuable lesson 'cause I didn't know what to expect being in a small room with them and just a few staff members\nHe was very very cordial collegial and transactional he said first words he said we're going to get this done he was respectful of the staff\nEmpowered them sorry what is and how to do with their own ... and public infection\nBecause the superintendent has that bully I don't think I'd be interrupted you how does have\nI'm getting a resume last and I just want to get back on track to the crash and then get tax policy questions\nI'm asking questions and I finished my answer thank you\nSo I I cite that as an example of a bipartisan bill that we produce which by the way was signed into law by then President Bill Clinton\nSo I've got both the executive ability as I said earlier high level managerial experience and I also have the political legislative experience and I don't want to downplay that because it's important for the superintendent that to perform that advocacy role and to do that\nSo I I ... as an example of a bipartisan bill that we produce which by the way we are still under the law by then President Bill Clinton\nSo I've got both the executive ability as I said earlier high level managerial experience and I also have the political legislative experience and I don't want to downplay that because it's important for the superintendent that to perform that advocacy role and to do that I think you have to have real life experience and credibility not rhetoric\nMissiles were going to charter schools you know the rest of your series in the Arizona Republic what you're seeing certain members of a member of the legislature water particular has benefited financially from his what sort of charter schools for do you like to see and the terms of standards would you like to see charter school standards of traditional public schools have the same\nOne so first that top issue in terms of our charter schools as we need to eliminate the corruption that we're saying we need to absolutely and implement\nConflict of interest laws so we need because as we've seen we have legislators who own charter schools who are passing the lives\nThat have that they then can go on to profit millions of dollars and when I hear millions of dollars being prompted by our ... by our legislators I'm not just seeing dollars I'm think calculators I've had\nI'm seeing 'em that the roof that can be fixed the new playground that can be belt so we need to make sure that our tax dollars are going into our classrooms or ... are being put back into the hands of our teachers\nAnd so that's the absolute first thing that we need to be\nImplemented and that I I Do believe that would be a legislative issue that I Would be down there working with them working with the governor to move that law for it to make it illegal for what they are currently doing\nOn the other part of the question back to the standards as we we do need to find some way of making the system more fair there needs to be more accountability more transparency for a charter school\nThat what we need to be implemented and not I I Do believe that would be a legislative issue that I Would be down there working with them working with the governor to move that law for it to make it illegal for what they are currently doing\nOn the other part of that question back to the standards as we we do need to find some way of making a system warfare there needs to be more accountability more transparency for our charter schools\nAnd just to give an example of like this could look like I was just thinking about one of my former students can I refer to as sand and when he first came to me free speech therapy\nUm I learned that he had just been placed in a group home and said he was a foster child and when he came in the first day he showed me bruises on his arm and told me that his mom does not love him and you know in our school did not have\nA counselor and social worker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWere addicted to opioids that we don't know how we will deal with that\nWithout true help in addressing the needs of these students so we have a huge crisis on her around in Arizona and if I have my metric one if I could influence the policy decision making in state government\nI Will make funding to close the achievement gap some better funding for rural schools the talks on the priorities that in that sort of kept me for that and better compensation for teachers and educators based on the benchmarks are\nI have also seen the severity of the inequity of our funding formula and how our rural schools have been hit the hardest we honestly don't realize it until we go out and see at ourselves and we talk to the teachers they talk and we hear about that the struggle to find teachers and to fill those vacancies\nUm one thing that makes this situation even worse\nIt's our current school grading system the eighth throughout grading system which is heavily weighted on the easy merit test scores\nSo ours and it's also we also know that are easy merit test scores are correlated strongly with socioeconomic status\nAnd so we are seeing across the state very just just proportionate amount of funding going out depending on um the test scores and so that's another thing that we need to completely reform um that is it's not affecting not just schools out in rural Arizona but also our some of our urban schools that that are in areas more\nUm lower socioeconomic status areas\nAre but what I Will say in my travels on the bright side as I said I Want to make sure we keep talking about all the amazing things happening in our schools and one on one of my travel as I was meeting with a principle of a school in ... county\nAnd he told me that in order to help decrease the number of school suspensions\nAt that are in areas more um lower socioeconomic status areas\nAre but what I Will say in my travels on the side as I said I Want to make sure we keep talking about all the amazing things happening in our schools and one on one of my travels I was meeting with a principle of a school in ... county and he told me that in order to help decrease the number of school suspensions\nThat he implemented a common language and the school that he called the cowboy code of conduct\nAnd with is the teachers and students all learned little sayings like I'm nowhere to know where to draw the line or always finish what you start so these different types of little grits types of things to encourage kids to help them keep going and\nAnd wish that they they are the students could earn a cowboy belt buckle as a reward and with this program they did see a significant decrease in the number of in school suspensions which is like they were targeting to decrease\nBut what I Would also say is that when I learned about the cowboy code of conduct\nI couldn't help but think to myself if I had tried to implement that at my school in the Peoria school district my students that have last me out of the classroom there's no way that they would have responded well to any cowboy code of conduct so one thing that I've seen first hand and learned through my travels around the entire state is that the policies\nThat are ... that we create and the department of education in our state government drastically affects rural Arizona in a different way and that's why it's critically important to have those educators at the table so we can hear about how are these policy is going to affect your community\nI think that's a good point by the way in ... to those cowboy ... [laughter] but I I think rural areas and was probably under represented on the state board of education the state board for charter schools with living care if he just made a very good point in that regard\nWay and that's why it's critically important to have those educators at the table so we can hear about how are the policy is going to affect your community\nI think that's a good point by the way and and I only have ... to that as a cowboy up [laughter] but I I think the rural areas and was probably underrepresented\nOn the state board of education the state board for a charter school so I think Kathy just made a very good point in that regard I also think I see a little potential for bipartisan compromise\nAnd that's over the A. F. school report card the grading system I think I mentioned earlier it doesn't tell us anything that we don't already know I don't necessarily believe that demography is destiny but I Do realize the impact social economic circumstances have on schools\nUm show I think maybe there is a middle ground to be forged there I don't like high stakes testing I think I said that earlier so I think we're in agreement on that and I certainly don't like high stakes testing coupled with rewards based funding\nBecause the rich get richer and we created two tier school system and the net effect of that by the way is we almost mandate teaching to the test [noise] number one and number two again we're penalize those schools and many of them are in rural Arizona the surge serve large number of disadvantaged and vulnerable students\nOr let's move on to another audience question and we'll get both of your opinions on this most often we'll start with you on this uh what are your views on bilingual education\nGot very strongly about bilingual education for those you know I mean um I had the privilege of attending a Japanese immersion program growing up I had half the day and Japanese and half the day an English all the way through eighth grade and then I realized caffeinated does not that you're still here [laughter] and\nSo when I was in college I went on to learn Spanish and then when I did my masters degree I did research and the area of the speech and language development a bilingual\nVery strongly about bilingual education for those who know me um I had the privilege of attending a Japanese immersion program growing up I had half the day and Japanese and half the day an English all the way through eighth grade and then I realize Japanese is not that useful here [laughter]\nAnd so when I was in college I went on to learn Spanish and then when I did my masters degree I did research and the area of the speech and language development a bilingual kids\nAnd specifically my research was published in peer reviewed journal and that was on um speech assessments to make sure that we're not miss diagnosing bilingual kids with a speech disorder because we want to make sure that we're not miss placing bilingual kids in special education and so that's been a gray area focus for me\nUm as one of my plans for the future of Arizona and our schools\nAnd one thing that shouldn't cost hardly any money is that something that I think has a lot of bipartisan support is to um to make the for our English only block more flexible to up to make 'em that as flexible as possible because what we're seeing is that Arizona\nHas the lowest high school graduation rate for English learning students in the country at Eighteen percent\nAnd so it has a lot of bipartisan support because we can just make it more flexible for the schools um a lot of ... educators ... there's a lot of strong support for this from both Democrats and Republicans\nAnd I'm as a result we will see a great improvement in our overall high school graduation rate and that will also directly have a positive impact\nOn our economy when those students are able to graduate high school and start careers and we know that many professions such as even think of America they have a an offensive that you make more money if you're bilingual so we need to stop treating it as a deficit and treat it as a professional asset and make sure that kids have\nWell high school graduation rate and that will also directed they have a positive impact\nOn our economy when those students are able to graduate high school and start careers and we know that many professions such as\nEven think of America they have a an incentive that you make more money if you're bilingual so we need to stop treating it as a death is set and treat it as a professional athlete and make sure that kids have bilingual learning opportunities\nMr eggs your views on bilingual education well first of all let me just say every time I hear Kathy describe her extraordinary bilingual skills I get very jealous because my parents made me take four years of high school Latin [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "05"}
