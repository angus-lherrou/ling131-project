don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten billion dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable today\nSo it sounds like we're we're hearing that Congress is is stepping up in trying to be a check\nOn the executive in this regard is anyone talking about the fact that the leader of the free world is not taking a stand on freedom of the press which the United states\nHas always been a beacon of light um when it comes to that in standing up for democracy\nYou know not especially but we should not be surprised considering a track record our president has had when it comes to respecting the press um [noise]\nHe has not been ... who has consistently uh advocated for journalists being able to hold their governments accountable or even you know we're dealing with American citizens and as as you saw as you heard in that\nCell by his first priority west whether or not Jamal was it American or not and that seemed to determine how interesting he was in his uh safety and his ability to write what he should be able to write as a

whether or not a Jamal was it American or not and that seems to determine how interesting he was in his uh safety and his ability to write what he should be able to write as a member of the press\nBut something that's very important for people to pay attention to and we have an article in the Washington Post's about this is that Donald Trump is that long standing business ties with Saudis Saudi government's boost his hotels\nSince he came into office he certainly benefits from a positive relationship\nWith the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and some of his critics and or and even some of his supporters certainly believe that is shaping how seriously he is or is not taking 'em efforts to find out what has happened to Jamal\nI'm CNN is reporting that President Trump's legal team is preparing answers to written questions provided by special counsel Robert Mueller and this is according to sources familiar with the matter\nSo this notion that Bob Mueller would lay low between Labor Day and election day\nI'm is not proving is not proving out is it\nIt is and and no one really should have expected him to you I mean he is so focused on this has been dividing\nProviding so much attention to this issue or since he's been put in this position I was talking to someone working on his team earlier about this and uh they're moving forward at their pace are getting to the bottom of what they believe the biggest issues are and or anyone talking\nAbout knowing for sure when this war wrap up its its just speculating at best\nOkay I Want to turn to\nTo this issue a since he's been put in this position\nI was talking to someone working on his team earlier about this and uh they're moving forward at their pace are getting to the bottom of what they believe the biggest issues are and or anyone talking about knowing for sure when this will wrap up its its just speculating about\nOkay huh I Want to turn to a Kanye West and the at the White House Eugene and and I just want to give the listeners who might not have heard the ten minutes to look we just a a a couple of sample here's one on ... and the alternative universe\nIs infinite amounts of universe and there's alternate

about Superman\nMy dad and my mom's separated and have a lot of mail energy in\nMy home and also a marriage will apparently that I'm\nNot a lot of mail energy doing all that beautiful\nBut there was a time where you know something about you know I Love I Love everyone writes but the campaign I was just made me feel that the\nGuy that he didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy that could play catch it was something about when I put his hat off it made me feel like super mass\nHe also used a number of choice words not safe for work or family listening I I I Want to bring in to this part of the discussion Christina Greer political science professor at Fordham University but Christina Eugene what was that I I\nThink unfortunately it's the slave a man who is suffering\nIt was something about like put his hat off and make you feel like Superman\nHe also used a number of choice words not safe for work or family listening I I I Want to bring in to this part of the discussion Christina Greer political science professor at Fordham University but Christina Eugene what was that I [noise] I think\nUnfortunately it's a display of a man who's suffering from some sort of break down or if you go back and listen to his first album he has become the antithesis of what he said that he ever wanted to be um I think it was really really troubling also\nYou know in that Superman description he's describing perfectly toxic masculinity he's the right leaning why so many men couldn't bring themselves to vote for someone like Hillary Clinton\nAnd you have in the oval office one of\nThe most sacred places I Would argue\nFor our American democracy\nWith two men who don't understand are respective roles the presidency as evidenced is Trump and his past behavior is in the past two years\nBut also tiny West I'm sitting in the office driving profanity and you know I Know a lot of people are trying to dismiss him oh he's just a rap we know that many rappers or some of the most intelligent word Smith of our generation that's\nNot on that's not debatable here but it clearly isn't on display we have a man who unfortunately has cast his lot\nAnd sold his soul to be with Donald Trump unfortunately is going to be the Bronx of history and I think it does hearken back to a bronco comical him him the J word so many years ago and both of them being from Chicago and him never being able to get over\n... Eugene can you talk about the political significance of what happened in the oval office today\nAbsolutely I wrote about it for the six or Donald Trump or it's genuinely convinced that are aligning himself with Kanye West will improve its ally with black voters\nShe's a bronco comical in in the J word so many years ago and both of them being from Chicago and him never being able to get over ... Eugene\nCan you talk about the political significance of what happened in the oval office today\nAbsolutely I wrote about it for the fix a Donald Trump is genuinely convinced that are aligning himself with Kanye West will improve his ally with black voters or Fox News earlier today he said that his approval rating with black voters\nWent up twenty five percent since ... has been vocal and support for Trump\nThe truth is a black support for Trump is never even been twenty five percent much less gone up twenty five percent of the reality here is that uh we have a president who has admitted to having a soft spot for entertainers and celebrities and people who are famous because he views them as a culture sabers\nWhich they are however most black people do not take their political views from entertainers period much less hip hop artist much less ... and so it would be the best interest of the president to know that ... does not speak for black Americans\nCoyote wet speaks for ... a west but it may be difficult for the president to know this because he doesn't have any senior black people and his team who could inform him of the issues that matter most to black Americans and how they go about choosing which politicians feedback\nEugene Scott from the Washington Post thanks for coming on America on the line thanks for having me\nMichael Waldman thank you very much for joining us tonight Christina you'll be back later in the show time for a break when we return young people voting for their lives and you're listening to America on the line\n[noise]\nAnd good evening you are listening to Ninety One point five and ... dot org and this is America on the line on ... a new show that airs Monday through friday until election day fresh air is on friday and we'll return all week after the election\nDueling signs dot Scottsdale roadways on the future of McDowell Sonoran preserve tomorrow morning\nAnd good evening you are listening to Ninety One point five and ... dot org this is America on the line on ... a new show that airs Monday through friday until election day fresh air is on friday and we'll return all week after the election\n[noise] dueling signs dot Scottsdale roadways on the future of McDonalds sooner and preserve tomorrow morning at nine on the show the pros and cons of proposition for ... and we'll analyze the week's top stories on the friday news cat that had more on the show tomorrow morning at nine on ...

country\nAnd same with our focus on voter registration we want to welcome to people who've been part of a nationwide effort to register young people it's activism that was born of tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school joining us from Parkland, Florida are ... cofounder of march for our lives\nAnd Ryan beach content creator for much for our lives delayed it Ryan thank you very much for being on America on the line\nI think if I say give 'em ... before I even start this this conversation I Want to thank you for 'em your heart and your activism in ...\nCo founder of march for our lives and Ryan beach content creator for march for our lives the lady Ryan thank you very much for being on America on the line\nI think if I say give\n'em ... before I even start this this conversation I Want to thank you for 'em your heart and your activism\nIn everything that you've done since February fourteenth of this year you've done a great thing at such a young age and I was in Washington for march for our lives and had not seen anything like that\nIn my eleven years in the nation's capital and as everyone knows it was born\nA out of gun violence prevention or was the was the the cars but it's become an even bigger than that what are you working on now what's been the focus\nRyan up a well ... the focus so far has has definitely shifted towards as as you know the midterm election is coming on November sex\nAnd we are preparing the young people America as well as everybody else just vote in this upcoming election really just trying to educate as many people as possible uh we've been registering people since the time but the march\nAnd it's really just about expanding the electorate you that you know twenty fourteen about one in five\nYoung people are up to twenty nine actually came to the polls add a sacred only has a poll that came out about four hours ago that said it's a one in three Americans are planning to vote if that's true we've expanded the electorate\nAre way more than we protected\nDilemma do you want to jump in there\nFourteen about one in five young people on the up to twenty dollars in actually came to the polls are right now you could only has a cold at keynote about four hours to go to a one in three American Brooklyn and devote if that's true we've expanded the electorate\nAre way more than we predict\nThis dilemma do you want to jump in there\nI just wanted to say that it's interesting because oftentimes when we talk about how our focus has shifted to I'm voting and voter registration people don't realize that\nThe way that we can get these policy points that were really advocating for the way that we can prevent gun violence if I voting for leaders who will let those policy points who will represent their constituents it's all done through voting which is why the focus has taken place to begin with\nBecause that is the number one way for us to get involved\nSo you've been traveling around the country talking to prospective voters registering people not everyone agrees on gun control measures gun control measures would have you heard in and how was your interactions play out\nIt's often times people seem to think that it's so hard to reach the counterprotesters and people who don't agree with us but it's turned out to be largely in our perceptions\nMatter if the way that people perceive us and what our organizations does versus reality often times we would have these events and there would be a hundred protesters there who\nWould come into the conversation thing like you guys want to take away all of our guns and when we find that we don't we ... our policy ... things like safe storage and ... universal background checks a good amount of time their understanding oftentimes even agree with us and it'll be like wow I had no idea that I actually support some of her policy points but\nEven the people who don't necessarily agree with us it's just it's not based in their truthfully if it's oftentimes based on their perception but if they're not having that conversation it's about creating a dialogue and naturally what we want to focus on is the fact that when you talk\nThe stories are not universal background checks a good amount of the time they're understanding oftentimes even agreement that's going to be like wow I had no idea that actually support at some of her policy points but\nEven the people who don't necessarily agree with that it's just it's not based in their truthfully it's oftentimes based in their perception but if they're having a conversation it's about creating a dialogue and naturally what we want to focus on the fact that when you talk to someone no matter their views you can be so much more productive so\nIt it it's one thing to talk to talk to someone But Ryan how did you convince people to listen to hear you out\nOf well really could just how people let them in years out a lot of the time it's just\nReally it's a common to what it is hard it is about me lose about are coming into their comfort zones almost like a ... I tell the story a lot where after\nThe shooting at our school we did get a loser I'm a Twain way up the Miami Heat found on ... on our website increase the amount of people that are registering to vote ...\nAnd it's really just a matter of years we were on a be covered by land because we were on the covers of all the sports pages and it was showing\nThat we have to hit people with they are no hard to just have those\nConversations and do it under that fat voting\nGet out the vote screw with Michelle Obama hold on to them a lot of people go because of course the former first lady she she was a very public figure that people like to I mean if you aren't already in the world if you are an already connected to see that you won't show up on the message\nI'm Glad you you you mentioned\nIs an honor that that\nVoting get out the boats Michelle Obama hold on to them a lot of people go because of course it's the former first lady she was a very secure that people like to see if you are already in that world if you are and already do you like to see that you won't show up on them too much\nI'm Glad you you you mentioned Dwayne wade because the celebrity does play a factor we saw that\nUm was that this week the time has it's now just melt together I don't remember ever Taylor Swift was this week or if that was last week but when she put on Instagram that you know telling people that they should vote for I'm reticent in Tennessee\nThere was a huge spike at at ... dot org of a a hundred and sixty six thousand people\nA signed up with forty two percent of registering falling between the ages of Eighteen and twenty four um did you see 'em a march for our lives any kind of Taylor Swift effect for you I Know that happened when Ariana a ground day\nOr was with you guys have march for our lives\nAre are already on the ground they shut down our website\nWrapping up [laughter]\nSo so like celebrity not endorsements but celebrities support is crucial\nWell it's interesting because if it's not necessarily the perception of celebrities that we we used the term influence there because when you're trying to engage young people in a way that they'll actually\nFind to be interested in finding the stain of all he has to do it in a way that young people understand and oftentimes we're not going to really be enraged by a lot of the different methods that have been used before but when you're using these people that we often times look\nTo in social media in our actual immediate all throughout our daily lives\nThat's when you can maybe get them interested me are showing somebody that they've ever\nThere because when you're trying to engage young people in a way that they'll actually find to be interesting and find to me the stain of all he has\nTo do it in a way that young people understand and oftentimes we're not going to really be enraged by a lot of the different methods that have been used before but when you're using these people that we oftentimes let's too in social media in our actual immediate all throughout our daily lives\nThat's when you can really get them interested when you're showing somebody that they relate to and that they connect you on a level like this that they are oftentimes following because they are a celebrity but because they are an influence or they're\nGoing to be more engaged in it it's just about speaking the language of the people that you're trying to raise and I think that's I mean we're missing for a long time\nSo I'm a ... we have a ... and Ryan some young people who we reached out to the talk to them a across the country about whether they're registered to vote and if so what are they going to do one of those is DJ Lacey calling\nIn from Massachusetts but is from West Virginia DJ thank you for calling into America on the line\nI thank you so much for having me tonight I'm Glad to be here\nSo am I right you're an independent who votes Republican\nI Am I'm a registered independent um I actually voted off for the first time in the primary in may in West Virginia and I voted in the Republican primary\nAnd I'm In the ... the Senate race that's happening that's happening right now Marcy versus ... mentioned um where are you following or you are you going to go for the Republican candidate\nCertainly been a very interesting race you know if you look in West

don't vote so let's get into the question of turnout\nJoining me now from Washington is Derrick Johnson president of the N. double ACP they've launched a new initiative\nTo get black voters to vote and to stay politically engaged particularly African American women and back with me is Fordham political ... political science professor Christina Greer welcome to you both to America on the line\nThank you thank you for having me so President Johnson let me start with you and and quote back to you something you wrote in a an opinion piece you wrote in essence magazine that came out yesterday you wrote it is clear that this nation's voting system wasn't built for us\nFor our listeners who who may not know what what this looks like for for black folks can you please explain what you mean what you mean by this\nSystem of voting in this country was built for aristocratic white males I was not created for for participation of African American and that fact for white women African American men have the right to vote for white women have the right to vote although there\nWere aggressive efforts to suppress to write\nA to exercise a vote by after America's particularly in the south so the system was not built for us to participate but you know just like Langston Hughes wrote a poem in Nineteen thirty six ah America will be America that we dream of because we're going to participate to ensure that\nOh although there were aggressive efforts to suppress to write\nA to exercise of well by after America's particularly in the south so the system was not built for us to participate\nBut you know just like Langston Hughes wrote a poem in Nineteen thirty six uh America will be the America that we dream of because we're going to participate to ensure that all citizens are treated with protection under the law\nNow you also saying that that essence piece that African Americans or can can make it meaning the voting system work for us what are some of the way to end up see if he is hoping to make the system I work as it should for black people who have you\nUnderstand the history of voting of this country particularly for African Americans are up until Nineteen sixty five we were denied a large part the right to exercise or\nThe vote even though we we had it on paper there were so many laws to suppress the vote or in the American south you know for then double ACP and many of our partner organizations at the time oh there was an aggressive effort that led to the signing of the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act\nAnd in that act it requires certain jurisdictions to get pre clear to change the rules of engagement\nAre because we knew you can have the right on paper but if you put both suppress of measures in place it would deny a by and large large a\nOf people the right to vote for then double ACP our goal is one to fight against in a vote suppression methods to to make sure individuals know when the vote is to take place how they can exercise that right\nAnd I understand that the choices that in front of them without us telling African Americans how to vote\n[noise] so I'm President Johnson I Want to go to Kayla\nA number of people the right to vote for then double ACP our goal is one to fight against in a vote suppression a message to to make sure individuals you know when the vote is to take place how they can exercise their right\nTo understand the choices that in front of them without us telling after America how to vote and\nSo I'm running Johnson I Want to go to Kayla who is calling in from East Tennessee Kaylan thank you very much for calling into America on the line have you ever voted\nI have not no I'm very excited and also scared to\nDo what you are very excited and you're scared to do so I\nI yeah I Am not so much scared as just intimidated there's so much um that I don't know that I Want to know I Want to make 'em an educated vote I Want to do um\nI Want to do what's right by what I Believe um but there's a lot of pressure I live in an area that's um predominantly Republican and it's it's pretty apparent in our area that if you don't agree or slaves\nThat uh the way they've always been your show ... are judged I'm In it you know I found myself complaining about the way that things are\nYet I felt guilty because I've never been to that so it's almost like the lottery you know if you don't play you can't win and um\nI felt a an overwhelming sense of\nUh [noise] I guess responsibility and went and I feel like I this is something I have to\nDo well Kayla was there a particular issue or in incidents that push you to go from never voting to thinking oh my God I have to do\nIt but like everybody else is saying it was a a conglomeration of things that actually started in our local politics um we've got some folks that have been nominated year after year after year and that's the definition of insanity you know you you get the same people in office and want different results and of course they're not rendered um and we're just\nThat push you to go from never voting to thinking oh my God I have to vote [noise]\nAh it but like everybody else is saying it was a a conglomeration of

[laughter] I didn't hear about taxes before I actually do now\nI have a daughter in elementary school at um you know the board of education and and all those things are just being triggered and um I use triggered on the way that you know it's you're going to my mind and I just I Want to do that to my local civic duty and then you know I start watching the debate and I have to\nI have to get involved and the things that I agree with him don't agree with and our states\nKayla I Want to thank you very much for calling into America on the line killer was calling in from East Tennessee you should never voted before but she's going to\nIn twenty six days I'm a I'm a ... before it comes to Christina I'm going to go to Scott in in Washington Heights here in New York City Scott welcome to America on the line\nOh thanks around around ... have you voted before\nI have voted for most recently uh twenty six day\nOh okay well that that counts that counts so what are you going to vote in the midterm\nUh [noise] but the thing I'm having an internal debate with myself about whether or not\nI Will uh use explain I feel\nThat in this may be cynical me to say this [laughter]\nUm but I feel that\nWe really have the illusion of choice when it comes to choice to be\nA ...\nThing I'm having an internal debate with myself about whether or not I will\nUh he was explaining I I feel\nThat in this may be cynical me to say this [noise] um\nBut I feel that we really have the illusion of choice when it comes to ... choice in terms of choices that matter\nUh you know we can have Fifteen flavors of bagels but we are only have two parties and our political system that I feel that a large percentage of Americans really don't have their interests represented\nAre all in my mind I feel like there is an illusion of choice when it comes to significant political positions in this country\nScott and then when I think you want to thank you very much for for calling and I want to bring in Christina Greer here boredom political science professor\nI uh\nUh where do you guys got just blew my blew my mind there because given the two years that we've been through this idea that like there's there's no difference is this is astounding to me but you talk about what the calls we've just heard but also the the effort that the N. double ACP is trying is undertaking\nTo ensure that African Americans not only registered to vote\nBut stay active and voted right and I think that that registration pieces key right because we know that participation is a two step process it's registering and then turning out to them but before I answer to delve into that\nI I think with Caitlin scatter saying you're actually a little similar right both of them are not full participants in the electoral process keep mine Scott Rudin twenty sixteen we had municipal elections all throughout twenty Seventeen that's right [laughter] right right mayor and city council in public advocate and comptroller\nTwo step process it's registering and then turning out to vote but before I answer delve into that\nI I think what Kayla and got her saying are actually a little similar\nRight both of them are are not full participants in\nThe electoral process keep mine Scott Rudin twenty sixteen we had municipal elections all throughout twenty Seventy bucks right [laughter] right through our mayor and city council public advocate and comptroller I mean people who control our lives in a very visceral and local level and the control right away and very direct way\nI think unfortunately um you know it's got to we have two parties we actually way more than two parties we have two dominant parties", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "12"}
