representative Devin Nunes and against the his Democratic opponent the attorney Andrew Janz what's this what's the focal point of this race will so it's\nInteresting because that race is obviously become one of national importance because diving ... who is the head of the house intelligence committee which is the committee that\nIs supposed to be investigating whether or not president Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to kind of took the election and his favor\nDoesn't mean as is in charge of that committee and as the head of that he has done a lot of things to block investigations he is I've been accused of colluding with the White House to block that investigation\nUm but back home in Central Valley California voters either don't really know much about what he's up to with the Russia investigation or they don't believe\nWhat they've read in mainstream media reports and Andrew Janz a prosecutor who's running against him he knows that's the case so he's not really campaigning on that he was raised a ton of money off of the outside of the state but within the state campaigning on water issues ... a Central Valley is a very agricultural they're very dependent on water\nAnd Andrew Janz of kind of trying to make the case that diving in as a so busy cooperating with the White House on Russia and other issues that he has not time to bring water to fight for infrastructure bills that would bring water box of central California farmers\nAnd it real quickly as Andrew Janz even competitive this is a close race it's\nI it's Phil Latzman and thank

usually than face significant competition that the ... behind by about ten points right now\nAll right Brian and Brian in Minnesota Bloomberg News is reporting that Minnesota is looking more and more like a bellwether for the country particularly in the house races at talk about that\nYeah there are eight congressional districts in Minnesota and four of them are considered true battlegrounds there's a couple that are in open seats were democratic incumbents are leaving those are areas that Donald Trump won two years ago\nAnd one of them is leaving to run for governor the other one to step decide to run for lieutenant governor a different ticket didn't make it through Republicans have a really strong shot at capturing this seat in northern Minnesota where\nDonald Trump has been you know his his working class message has really resonated in southern Minnesota the trade tariffs are causing some uh\nTrouble for his party because the ... it's very farm heavy so the Democrats are trying to hold on to that and they might have a shot at that and then there are two suburban seats where Donald Trump is is a focal point a lot of suburban women are cool to Donald Trump Donald Trump actually endorsed one of the Republican incumbents this week in that race\nThat incumbent hadn't been trying to keep a distance from the president's so there's some question as to whether that will really help him or if it will be more of an anchor around his neck\nOr the Democrats who are running in these races are they making Donald Trump a focal point are they trying to do with Andrew Janz is doing in California\nWait a lot of suburban women are cool to Donald Trump Donald Trump actually endorsed one of the Republican incumbents this week in that race that incumbent had been trying to keep a distance from the president's so there's some question as to whether that will really help him or if it will be more of an anchor around his neck\nOr the Democrats who are running in these races are they making Donald Trump a focal point are they trying to do with Andrew Janz is doing in California and talk about a issues\nThe two Republicans running in these open seats in in kind of more rural areas they're given a big bear hug did the president they both appeared within the president came to town and both of their district\nThe president's ah ... the political action committee that's associated with the president is spending a lot of money that is but a million dollars in for the last two weeks in one of the congressional races\nAnd in the suburbs there there there's one candidate who's who's appeared on stage with Trump in and said that I I fully support all the actions that the president's taken and then the other one Erik Paulsen who is kind of more of a moderate Republican has like I said tried to keep his distance from the president and he he's running behind right now\n... that's going to end Helen Peterson in Montana welcome back to this to the show and\nPresident Trump or I mean he's been to Minnesota a lot in North Dakota are a lot but he's been to Montana a lot\nAh he's throwing his full weight behind Republican state auditor Matt Rosendale who's running against the incumbent Senator Jon tester why as Montana such a huge priority for the Republican Party\n[noise] well yeah you know like you said he's been here three times since the first time he came was July ... and I think you know I honestly think that a lot of it has to do with the fact that tester and his role and with the\nWith veterans services that Veterans Affairs committee and was one of the ...\nFor the Republican Party [noise] well yeah you know like you said he's been here three times since the first time he came was July fest and I think you know I honestly think that a lot of it has to do with the facts that tester and his role um with the\nWith veterans services the Veterans' Affairs committee and was one of the ... the list of complaints against\nAh the president's doctor who had nominated to a service head of the VA um those complaints were not investigated or or confirmed necessarily but\nI'm the doctor did you send his his application the next day and Trump just sees that as an enormous affront to said afterwards that he thought that test or should resign\nAnd I think he also just doesn't understand\nHow he could win big in Montana you know he won by\nNearly twenty percent and yet the state ... Democrats like tester and our governor who won the same year that Trump won is also a Democrat you know he said when he was here one of the time she was like I just don't get it like how could you will like this guy tester\nAnd when he doesn't get is that Montana is a pretty famously and historically purple state that prides itself on voting crushed ticket you know today there was a\nA quote in a profile of tests are and the Atlantic were tester said you know like I'm a democratic senator and I've never voted straight ticket and not to a lot of people I think feels anathema to what a Democrat or Republican would be like how could you vote\n... down in your party [laughter] it's totally old school but there that eat those the person over party really remains here it's it's dwindling but it still remains and that's what they test your thinking on\nWell early on in in the show's life we do to you know ... ...\nAnd that and to a lot of people I think feels an accent that to what a Democrat or Republican would be like how could you vote ... going on in your party it's totally old school but there that eat those have person over party really remains here it's it's dwindling but it still remains enough at ... at ... thinking on\nWhy early on in in this shows life we did a ... you know a big focus on Montana and the color the folks who called in they made that very clear up Montanans are very independent has nothing to do with the party that has to do with the person I just let me come back to you in California the other race\nUm that is of interest is the one involving the incumbent congressman Duncan Hunter are up against a new a newcomer Democrat twenty nine years old um our company ...\nHunter is under indictment for misusing campaign funds and camping dodge are as I said is twenty nine years old but he's also a Mexican Palestinian American or in this race in hunter\nHasn't been shy about using his challengers ancestry against him take a listen to this ad\nA markup of jars working to infiltrate Congress three different leaves the high despite ... his grandfather masterminded the Olympic massacre whose father served as I\nMexican millennials immigrant named mark ... doesn't get support from the San Diego\nThe messaging and Texas and in Florida has been like you're going to turn the stay into another Venezuela and the ... and for the message in Idaho you know another Venezuela [laughter] yeah well\nAnd held Peterson Jessica silver Brian backed thank you very much for being on America on the line we have to take a break and when we return a conversation about the state of our nation with one of our country's most thoughtful journalists\nWho happens to be pretty optimistic we'll take your calls here's the question what are you personally optimistic about eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five you're listening to America on the line [noise]\n\nThis is America on the line on kj ...

term elections from WNYC radio in public radio stations across the country\nThis has been one of the most turbulent election cycles we've experienced in a long time but we've been here before some of you listening lived through the tunnel of Nineteen sixty eight the assassinations of Martin Luther king and Robert Robert F Kennedy and the massive anti war protests and then there was the political turn of Watergate\nThe question is what lessons did we learn and can we get back on less divided ground here now to talk about where we've been and where where we are and where we're going is James Fallows national correspondent for the Atlantic and co author with his wife dead Paulos of our town a one hundred thousand mile journey into the heart of\nAnti war protests and then there was the political turn of Watergate\nAnd the question is what lessons did we learn and can we get back\nOn less divided ground here now to talk about where we've banned and where where we are and where we're going is James Fallows national correspondent for the Atlantic and co author with his wife debt Fallows of our town a one hundred thousand mile journey into the heart of America\nWelcome James I just want to remind everyone that the question for tonight is what are you personally optimistic the optimistic about\nCall us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nSo Jains have you ever\nIn all your years of political reporting seen a political climate like this\nUh this you very technically [laughter] without spin a lot of years of seeing politics in college back in the late Nineteen sixties and so\nI've seen things I haven't seen anything just like this because there's never been anybody just like Donald Trump\nBut there are times in my lifetime when American politics have been I think objectively worse than out in Nineteen sixty sixty eight we had Martin Luther king and Bobby kennedy be assassinated within the course of a couple of months we had hundreds and hundreds of Americans per week\nDying in Vietnam and you know thousands of Vietnamese and we had dozens of cities will outright\nUh you know riots and then people being shot or you're mainly African American people being shot so\nThis is a bad time in national politics is not the only bad time to you as his hat\nNow James discovering that live bombs were center prominent critics of President Trump including two former presidents would seem like an inflection point that we're we're in not only in this election cycle but in the country but is it it can it be when the president of the United states\nThis is a bad time and national politics is not the only bad time the U.S his hat\nNow James discovering that live bombs were center prominent critics of President Trump including two former presidents would seem like an inflection point that we're we're in not only in this election cycle but in the country but is it and can it be\nWhen the president of the United states blames the press for this moment that were in\n... so let me try to be careful and distinctions here on the one hand\nI yield to nobody and thinking that Donald Trump\nIs an aberration in his job is uniquely irresponsible in the way he's summing up the worst impulses in American culture in spirit so I I Will not make any defense whatsoever\nFor what he says about the press what he says about ... relations among the diverse parts of the American fabric or an eighth I think also that sort of an oddball thing I Will say on this this terrible terrible bomb threat\nIs that um I once worked one go for president I worked for Jimmy Carter when he's in the White House there was a speechwriter anybody in public office\nIs used to dozens of daily threats one kind or another you know this is not minimizing this at all this is horrible Trump in my view is sort of fanning the flames I I Would be weary of thinking that\nAll of America is some in some kind of um [noise] uh you know new civil war because some guy did this you know there have been people doing extreme things before some person did this\nWell let me ask you did uh the question in a different way does the press bear any responsibility for the tone and temper we're living in [noise]\nAh yes just because the press by definition is part of the the temper of any time and I think that that I think the cable news\nKnow there have been people doing extreme things before some person did this\nWell let me ask you did uh the question in a different way does the press bear any responsibility for the tone and temper we're living in\nA way yes just because the press by definition is part of the the temper of any time and I think that that I think the cable news cable TV news in particular has been caught in a\nIn a cycle that is really a ... that they recognize from a distance is a problem but it's hard for them to get out of the one go back when most of your listeners where children back in the mid nineties I wrote a book called breaking breaking the news and that subtitle was held a media undermine American democracy and its argument was\nThat if the news gotten the business of being head to head competition with entertainment that was going to be a sort of destructive cycle because\nEntertainment by definition is always you know more interesting were entertaining and the news is designed to have some kind of bored to say we're going to show you what's important\nAnd make it as interesting as we can but not just the ... and I think that there's been a combination of tea of cable news in general sort of feeding the spectacle and over the last twenty plus years there's there has been just objectively a right wing um\nMedia empire has has made it easier for people to believe things that aren't true so I think that the media has been part of a divided ecosystem on national politics are but I'm not echoing\nIt'll what Donald Trump says in in making that\nPoint mhm well is is any of this a fixable either in the near term or ever\nYes and I think as another former president said it depends what the meaning of this year [laughter] so so if we're talking about\nDivided ecosystem on national politics are but I'm not echoing it'll what Donald Trump says in making that\nPoint mhm well is is any of this a fixable either in the near term or ever\nUm yes and I think as another former president said it depends what the meaning of this year [laughter]\nSo so if we're talking about um the fabric of the United states the argument that that my wife Devon I've been making over the last four or five years and the Atlantic and in our book is essentially that debt and just the moment\nWhen national politics really is bitter and really is dysfunctional and really is polarizing you do have the other parts of American Life almost in reaction\nFinding ways to reconstitute their civic fabric and the last five or six months we've been sort of an open ended book tour in\nRed state America mainly where people say yes run the show you Little Rock Arkansas let us show you Bellingham, Washington Leno show you Pensacola, Florida let a show you Muncie, Indiana these places where\nPeople can find a way to stop arguing about the sort of fratricide national politics and experiment with their schools and experiment with um with\nUh with all sorts of things can I tell you a story about dodge city we have time for\nUs so it goes I I I was going to get to dodge city um after asking you about asking you about your book which is called our towns a hundred thousand mile journey into the heart of America in which\nYou you did this hundred thousand mile journey and despite the ... the seeming freak out that it's happening around the country particularly if you're looking at at cable news you came away from that trip and even in your comments in this interview right now optimistic\nAbout about the country and I do ... explain\nIt's an mile journey into the heart of America in which\nYou you did this hundred thousand mile journey and despite the ... the seeming freak out that it's happening around the country particularly if you're looking at at cable news you came away from that trip and even in your comments in this interview right now optimistic\nAbout about the country and I do explain why and and incorporate dodge city into your hands yes\nSo first of all have a definition of optimism that I came across recently met probably many people know but it was new to me a ... one poll rumor won the Nobel Prize in economics a week or two ago somebody I've known them like he he just didn't Bush\nWhat he called complacent optimism which was the belief that things\nWill get better from what he called conditional optimism which was the belief that they could get better\nAnd then they could get better if you try and if you get engaged in if you're involved et cetera you know for me complacent optimism is that next week I'll be a good shape ... is that six months from now I could be a good shape if I\nYou know sorts and so I think it has conditional optimism in the face of genuine uh not not\nJust spare a genuine darkness of the national level where where do we need to express and\nI'll give you the dodge city except I think most of your listeners saw the story last day or two of the polling place in dodge city famous from the gun smoke westerns now a majority which you know town the polling place being moved away out of town\nTo a you know apparently just to depressed turn out by the ... Latino electorate there in darts dodge city um when we were in dodge city uh two two years ago at some great lengths we were impressed that the mainly Anglo\nNow the polling place being moved away out of town to up you know ... to depressed turn out by the ...

Connecticut and you know I'm Eighteen and I'm Still in high school and so my\nCivic involvement I guess you'd only started praying recently but you know so then it makes me really optimistic is even though politics are really chaotic I guess even on a local level but especially in a national level\nUm I've noticed so much involved in it from people in my generation and people my age being motivated to\nOrganize for things they believe in and like I had the opportunity to work to organize my school's march for our lives last year and you know I just when I have looked at the primaries I saw so many people who are my age and there'd been a lot of voter registration drives and I'm really optimistic about the way that\nMy generation is sort of like you know making sure that we're educated involved about the issues that are going to affect us and the generations that come after us and that gives me hope she'll ever at\nMali let me ask you a question since you are of that generation that we old folks are always talking about the young people young people are not they're not motivated in young people don't vote and the young people don't care how do you feel about that\nWell I feel like sometimes when people say things like that to me I say well did you vote in the primaries are you\nThat gives me hope fell over at my let me ask you a question since you are of that generation that we old folks are always talking about the young people young people are not they're not motivated in young people don't vote and the young people don't care how do you feel about that\nOh I feel like sometimes when people say things like that to me I say well did you vote in the primaries are you register or you\nCan have you research the candidates and a lot of the time these\nYou know sometimes middle aged people who say things like that to me and my friends they can't say yes to those questions and a lot of us can and so I think that you know I think that people should give us a chance is a demographic and give us a chance and realize that\nA lot of us are willing to educate ourselves regardless of you know what side we fall on\nMolly you are part of that that Parkland generation that makes me optimistic about the future of our country thank you so much for calling in to America on the line\nThank you so much for having me let's go to Matt in white cough New Jersey not thank you for calling into America on the line\nHey how you doing thanks for taking my call\nSure why are you optimistic\nI'm optimistic I'm a therapist by trade and and I I I can tell that America's scene seasons like this before where there's intense optimism and there's a tense disagreement on both sides and like I think that I'm optimistic about both sides getting serious\nAbout each other's pain and I'm not saying the pain is you know shared in certain points on both sides but I think we have to get back to being furious and I think that season is going to come around where something something's gonna happen you know whether it be another recession or you know the student loan debt or\nSomething is going to cause this where everyone's going to stop and started to kind of get curious and say why why are we even doing that so what's your pain what's my pain led sharing that\nAs you know shared in certain points on both sides but I think we have to get back to being serious and I think that season is going to come around where something something's gonna happen you know whether it be another recession or you know the student loan debt or\nSomething is going to cause this where everyone's going to stop and\nStart to kind of get curious and say why why are we even doing that so what's your pain what's my pain\nLed sharing that and let's try to get some understanding and I think my generation I'm I'm twenty nine and you know even a caller before me at Eighteen I think our generation is a little bit more emotionally intelligent um if I may say so ourselves that for a little bit more emotionally inclined to kind of go deeper\nAnd I I'm I'm really hopeful that we're going to start to get curious about paying against\nMatt I ... I ... I like that I liked that description of your of your generation I'm going to steal it [laughter]\nMatt thank you [laughter] thank you very much for calling into America on the line I bring the panel

caller yes maybe he's the one who bring everybody together with Mali as vice president that's right and and Helen Peterson I was reading an article about\nThe Democrat Bullock out in Montana and you know you wrote about people who voted for Trump for president and Democrat bullet for governor and just thought Hillary Clinton didn't listen to them or care about them so\nIt's one of the sixty four

you know you wrote about people who voted for Trump for president and Democrat Bullock for governor and just thought Hillary Clinton didn't listen to them or care about them so\nIt's one of the sixty four million dollar questions can Democrats appeal to white swing voters instill legitimately represent the base of people of color and progressive white women in the party um and you know maybe we just heard from that caller from New Jersey that at least ... ten show\nIs out there there's some hunger out there but then they still have to legitimately represent 'em now as far as the devices for me as a journalist I don't want to get ahead of the facts and I think again a lot of the sensationalizing media are getting ahead of the fact we don't know who did it\nWe don't know the motive\nActual right wing terrorists fake right wing terrorists on meet the press Chuck Todd wondered if maybe someone working for Russia\nRussia trying again just show divisions in American society he wasn't positive thing that he was just hung up his hands and saying we don't know maybe this is just a mentally ill persons expression of their disease\nAnd soon there will be answers but we don't have them yet now listening to New York city officials set their news conference today\nThey wouldn't even confirm if the devices were actual explosives that could actually explode or look alike devices just intended to cause fear that would still be terrorism right intend to cause terror for political reasons but we don't know if these were actually attempted assassination or big grotesque\nPublicity

that's where we are\nIn ... to take a a a hard turn here because I Want to have you talk about that the voter suppression efforts that are affecting Native Americans in Montana and there are a lot of people are focused on those efforts in North Dakota but what's going on in Montana [noise] well\nKnow in Montana I think a lot of the issues that they're saying that are present on rural reservations across the United states and that\nIt's hard to get your um absentee ballot because you know many people share post off post office boxes because there's not enough you know you can have up to like ten twenty people sharing a post office box and but then also just driving distance and that sort of thing\nAnd one thing that I've seen him and I have a big story coming out on this and this weekend is on the reservation and the Navajo reservation town in Utah\nYou know it's not just the distance that you have to drive it's not just the fact that the vast majority of citizens are currently miss
