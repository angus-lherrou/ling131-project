D. it's seven o'clock\n[noise]\nWNYC radio I'm Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line a news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations around the country\nWhere here every Monday through Thursday was the latest developments analysis and your calls our question tonight is especially intriguing and we'll get to that in just a few minutes with election day exactly one week away there's a lot of campaign news to cover let's start with the United States Constitution\nThe fourteenth amendment to be specific last night in an interview with Jonathan Swan from Axios\nStations around the country where here every Monday through Thursday was the latest developments analysis and your calls our question tonight is especially intriguing and we'll get to that in just a few minutes with election day exactly one week away there's a lot of campaign news to cover let's start with the United States Constitution\nThe fourteenth amendment to be specific last night in an interview with Jonathan Swan from actually does President Trump said he would sign an executive order to end what's known as birthright citizenship which gives every person born in the United states automatic citizenship\nSome legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the ... border exactly like\nAh have you thought about that is totally off it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member kissing women but you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number to nothing to do well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nJoining me to talk about the legal aspect of this is WNYC legal affairs correspondent Jamie Floyd Jamie welcome to welcome back to America on the line okay Jamie you're a legal expert is what the president proposes\nEven legal or constitutional\nUh I have my pocket constitutions you're waving writers mainly I certainly wish the president would open has\nSo let's just simply read the constitution and we only need to read the fourteenth amendment section one and Jonathan don't worry it'll take\nJust one second to read the relevant portion it's very explicit it's the citizenship clause and the very first words of the fourteenth amendment ratified right after the civil war or\nOpen has so let's just simply read the constitution and we only need to read the fourteenth amendment section one and Jonathan don't worry it'll take\nJust one second to read the relevant portion it's very explicit it's the citizenship clause of the very first words of the fourteenth amendment\nRatified right after the civil war all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state where they reside so what does that mean Jonathan eat is simple\nChildren born in the U.S automatically become citizens of the U.S and so any executive order to change this\nWould lead to an immediate constitutional debate over the fourteenth amendment and I've been thinking about this all day Jonathan I and my view and and the view it seems a of a broad swath of analyst in scholars today is that the fourteenth amendment citizenship guarantee is clear\nAnd that the president cannot erase it or really any other part of the constitution with an executive order that's the very foundation of our constitutional form of\nGovernment Jimmy can just provide some context why was the fourteenth amendment even necessary why was that cause you read even necessary that\nIs critically important to understand the main purpose of this clause was to overrule the now infamous Dred Scott decision of the U.S Supreme Court which was handed down in Eighteen fifty seven and that said Jonathan\n... as you and I know perhaps Donald Trump does not know this part of our history but it said that black slaves were property and that we were specifically Jonathan not\nOf this clause was to overrule the now infamous Dred Scott decision of the U.S Supreme Court which was handed down in Eighteen fifty seven and that said Jonathan\n... as you and I know perhaps Donald Trump does not know this part of our history but it said that black slaves were property and that we were specifically Jonathan not\nCitizens and and plus the decision also said that Congress and the states could not grant citizenship\nTo the descendants of slaves including the children of freed slaves they were not us citizens either and so this is why what has happened today is so painful\nIt is rooted in the ugly history of this country\nAnd the Dred Scott ruling was specifically nullified in sixteen fifty eight when the U.S ratified the fourteenth amendment which is essentially gave blacks the right to US citizenship and all persons born on this soil\nSo I won't even ask you a question about just let's say he was the president was able to actually do this the logistical nightmare of of enforcing that ... ... what he's proposing in the M is just kabuki theater Disney this is going nowhere\nThe politics of citizenship goes back a century or more citizenship has been a contested political issue\nSince reconstruction uh and and the president understands that you're asking me the legal part of this I can dive into the political if you want to do that now I you know coming today a days before the election it sounds more like a political stunt than any sort of reasoned argument\nBut given the ugly history um\nPolitical issue since reconstruction uh and and the president understands that you're asking me the legal part of this I can dive into the political if you want to do that now I you know coming\nToday a days before the election it sounds more like a political stunt than any sort of reasoned argument\nBut given the ugly history I'm ... I I think we have to think both about\nThe legal kabuki theater as you\nA college and the political implications of what he's trying to do and you as you recall Jonathan\nUh he he brought this up once before in ... in the two thousand six election it was all this talk about the executive order a ... around the citizenship question and then nothing came of it until when today brings it up again\nA and there's an expectation that after the midterm elections it will it will disappear that while it right well I have you here real quickly and um forgive me if I neglected to even bring this up as as a topic but I'm the president also an announced yesterday that he wants to send\nFifty two hundred troops to the border to help block migrants making slowly making their way up from Central America and that last\nUm read out they were over a thousand miles away from the U.S border with Mexico just legal migrants right the migrants legally speaking\nWhat can troops do the military do in terms of enforcing the law on the border\nRight well ... there he this has come up before with President Trump a and watch authority he has to give orders a visa v the U.S border uh and the military and which are aspects of our ah\nDo the military do in terms of enforcing the law on the border\nRight well ... there he this has come up before with President Trump a and watch authority he has to give orders\nA visa the the us border uh and the military and which are aspects of our ah for the U.S military forces border patrol et cetera should be monitoring the border by the way before the migrants have even approached the border\nUh so eats it's terribly complicated and again days before the election so let's have this conversation shall we after the election and see whether he's still talking about sending anyone to the border beyond the folks who are they are monitoring the border and part of their daily job all ready\nOkay so Jayme attacks near adopt herself on the show eight days from now [laughter] well I just made you an idea [laughter] that is\nGreat well Jamie a thank you very much Jamie Floyd WNYC legal affairs correspondent thank you ought to bring in our panel for tonight joining us is Washington Post columnist Council on Foreign Relations fellow\nConservative and author of the new book the corrosion of conservatism Max Boot and with me also here in the studio is Brian Lehrer host of WNYC use the Brian Lehrer show max Brian welcome to the show he Jonathan\nAre to be on okay I I Want to since I was talking with Jamie about um this executive order on the fourteenth amendment ... let's just have the ... have this discussion before it would turn to Pittsburgh Brian since er here um your your reactions to this\n[noise] well there's a lot to say and Jamie shed a lot of what needs to be said one other thing is that this\nI was talking with Jamie about I'm a I'm this executive order on the fourteenth amendment like let's just have to have had this discussion before we we turn to Pittsburgh Brian sincere here um your your reactions to this\nWell there's a lot to say and Jamie shed a lot of what needs to be said\nOne other thing is that there is a clause of the constitution as it relates to immigrants was actually tested\nIn the U.S Supreme Court a few decades later when\nChinese immigrants exclusion was all the rage in the United states like Latino in Muslim exclusion is now in certain circles and there was a Chinese American born in this country named long cam arc\nWho left the country and to test\nWhether this applied to immigrants um he was detained outside of San Francisco and he tried to come back and this went to the Supreme Court and they said yes this was not just applicable to former slaves but also to\nImmigrants and case closed now there are still people who say that that was one kind of immigrant case it could be tested again but I think it's very interesting for our listeners to know that with respect to immigrants that was tested none of the spring court Macs do you have any\n... any reaction to this talk about um an executive order rescinding the fourteenth amendment\nAbsolutely they need to do that or a ton of scandals this is the least ethical administrator and in us history and there's a lot of things I Need to be investigated that the Republican Congress has been eager to sweep under the carpet and a Democratic House has an obligation to use their subpoena power to get to the bottom of some of these scandals\nAlright max thank you very much Brian and max will be back later in the show when we

public radio\nStations around the country here's a question for you do Americans value democracy less than we used to what a lot of us be okay with a leader who wasn't required to work with Congress\nThe answer is yes according to the world values survey which measures attitudes about democracy and with that in mind that's our question for you tonight how do you feel about democracy\nIs our system of government working for you or could you imagine living under a different system and authoritarian system military leadership\nCall us at ... for for seven four or five eight to five five that heat for for seven four or five talk our colleagues at radiolab\nMine that's our question for you tonight how do you feel about democracy is our system of government working for you or could you imagine living under a different system and authoritarian system military leadership\nCall us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five that's eight four four seven four or five\nTalk our colleagues at radiolab are doing a special episode on democracy time to election day\nReporter a lot of Nasser joins us from Los Angeles to tell us more about how liberal democracy is regarded by its citizens welcome to Paris to underline letter thank you very much\nAll right so this this is fascinating and so you're you're ... episode starts off with something called as I mentioned before the world values survey and ... um\nThe Lucy where is that first question the first question and the survey is this how do you feel about having a strong ruler who doesn't have to bother with Congress or election what did people say in response to that\nWell so so the the the person researcher who who sort of find as far as a as a political scientist Josh a monk at Harvard and and he was comparing weight that people were answering these questions Americans were answering these questions are back in the nineties and then in the latest version of the survey\nAnd so the question or would you say that having a strong leader who does not have to bother with Congress in elections is a good way of governing the country I'm\nUh in Nineteen Ninety five about twenty four percent of Americans endorsed this idea of the strongman leader or in the latest survey thirty two percent it ...\nThat would that's incredible go ahead go ahead yeah which is really ... which is really surprising like a a I think for yeah for for for someone like me like coming from an immigrant family like the the the thing that you know the value in democracy\nFive about twenty four percent of Americans endorsed ... idea of the strongman leader or in the latest survey thirty two percent it ... that would that's incredible go ahead go ahead yeah which is really ... which is really surprising like a a I think for yeah for for\nFor someone like me like coming from an immigrant family like the the the thing that you know the value in democracy so much to hear that there is this this widespread discontent in this country that it's a that even you know a strongman leader that doesn't have to bother with Congress that's a very anti democratic\nIdeal that that you know might be appealing to to that many people\nSo the second question was how\nImportant is it for you to live in a democracy on a scale of one to ten right and so uh and so in that question about two thirds of older Americans which is to say those Americans born in the thirties or forties would give the highest response of very very important to live in a democracy you know the top the numbers [noise]\nUm but less than one third of millennials dead so it's really generational you see that ah yeah for younger people it's not quite as important to live in a democracy OK so before I get to the third question let's dive into this a little bit deeper ... ...\n... is the millennial response is fascinating\nAnd is that because of a a lack of trust in institutions and ... and if so what is driving that do you think\nWell there's a few there's a few reasons that especially that this researcher Yasser monk opposes one is just a economically standards of living have sort of stagnated so younger people see you know the success that their parents had that they don't see that themselves having not seemed success and nurse feeling\nA a a little unhappy about it another possibility is that you know you have older generations who remember\nFew reasons that especially that this researcher you after a monk opposes one is just a economically standards of living have sort of stagnated so younger people see you know the success that their parents had that they don't see that themselves having not seemed success nurse feeling\nA little unhappy about it another possibility is that you know you have older generations who remember a World War two I remember the Cold War\nOr they feel like they have something to compare it to they they knew that uh you know what uh Germany or the you know what fascism was like they know what I'm what Soviet communism was like an and they can say oh at least our democracy is not is not as bad as that\nWhereas now for millennials who you know have come of age a post Cold War uh there's really nothing else to compare it to and so you look at the system and it's just sort of dysfunctional and you think oh this this sucks\n[laughter] and the third the third question is do you think army rule is a good system of government how did people respond to that\nYeah so this it's it's it's a very surprising thing so their share of us citizens who thinks that it would be a good or a very good thing for the army to rule so in Nineteen Ninety five just one in sixteen respondents agree with that and then the last time this survey was done a one in six agreed\nWhat's ... what's behind that yeah no and it\nWell and and just to make it even more of like saying ... among among young affluent Americans one in three agreed that army rule would be good or very good\nWhile I'm I asked I asked that last question to get the army um military rule question out of the way because Allen is called in from Brooklyn or to answer a question about how do you feel about it\nWell and and just to make it even more like a among among young affluent Americans one in three agreed that army rule would be good or very good\nWow I'm\nI asked I asked that last question to get the army I'm military rule question out of the way because Allen\nIs called in from Brooklyn odd to answer our questions about how do you feel about ... is our system of government working for you um could you imagine living under a different system Alan what the you\nKnow the day I realized that we're not a democracy would be the day\nIf not the night before that I wouldn't leave um other than fighting for the democracy um I'm a son of a Jewish immigrants from polling who left in I'm In the light of a Nazi a Nazi taking power in Germany I'm ... years\nLater after the war and you know uh well during the Cold War when I went to visit his town in Poland and just returning from going from\nEast Germany to West Germany I was put in prison because of my papers warrant in order a they had forgotten to give me what they called the transit visa and just being in a place\nWhere you know you realize you have no records um there there is no opportunity to exercise freedom of speech a issue too it's either repressed or meaningless and then years later\nI worked as a journalist in ah in Chechnya where these people who are you opposed Russia were just literally obliterated a civilian city ...\nCity which were they called the worst onslaught of the worst bombing since uh the bombing of Dresden was a ...\nIssue too it's either repressed or meaningless and then years later I worked as a journalist in ah in Chechnya where these people who are you opposed Russia were just literally obliterated a civilian city ...\nBillion city which were they called the worst onslaught of the worst bombing since uh the bombing of Dresden was annihilated by ... and\nSo what are you there you go you know salad that's what you get when you don't have choice while I was about to ask you you have a band\nTo places where democracy is in short supply if you know not exist in if you ... as a lot of just pointed out your millennials are\nAre are down on democracy or in a down on the system of government we have now in one sentence what would you say to millennials um that would be sort of a rhetorical shaking them by their lapels\nWell you know I I asked a Chechen journalists what would you tell Russians to change their idea and she gave me this wonderful idea which I Would mold a little differently and she said I Would do a soap opera about the Russian man and a Chechen woman\nIn love well I Would do something on the net that would\nCapture what it is to live under a society because people have to appreciate it and understand it in their gut they don't understand the only way that you could possibly come up

Democrats feeling pretty good about their chances in general this is the topic of the political environment um uh it's almost more of a structural issue for the governorships hum of those twenty competitive\nA governorships um fourteen are held by the geo pay a whole bunch of those are actually open seats um and those are the sorts of seats which can can can flip\n'em so uh if you will take take the big picture for the governors' seats um I Would expect\nA of a a net change in the Democrats' direction of between three and tenth seats um if it gets to be tendencies and if a ... sort of on the outer edge of what's possible um that would actually be enough to flip a control quote unquote of the\nUh of of the governors' seats I'm from the G O P which currently has um [noise] uh thirty a a thirty three seats\nAmateur chef is thirty two Democratic at you I'm a just in the course of one one cycle\nI Am I'm Glad you brought that up because I was going to ask you do is thirty six governors' you how many\nA control quote unquote of the uh of of the governors' seats I'm from the G O P which currently has um [noise] uh thirty a a thirty three seats\nAmateur chef is thirty two Democratic at you I'm\nA just in the course of one one cycle\nWhere I Am I'm Glad you brought that up because I was going to ask you do is thirty six governorship how many are controlled by Republicans in how many are controlled by a by Democrats and in terms of state legislatures do you have ... ... at your fingertips how many state ...\nState legislatures both houses leaving out Nebraska sitting around in the unit camera system but um\nHow many feet lead legislatures are completely in the hands of the Republican Party are completely in the hands of the Democratic party\nThat's a great question actually come back to me because I I Do know ...\nThat that the GOP has a lot more they are called ... effective right I'm a than the Democrats do and I should say that um that ah there's a pattern it's a long term historical pattern\nThat um that if a party holds the White House they're bound to lose seats actually in Congress as well but as far as what we're talking about um they are bound to lose government governorships and also state legislature control is just a natural sort of known thing kind of\nA act by the voters I'm a a ... typically especially in these big mid term elections when so many governors' seats are up I'm a mid mid term elections are really bad historically for the party in power in the White House\nAnd there is a sort of a bleed down effect where a voters take out there that are aggressions on the party controlling the White House in some of the state races and so it's very common like you know any amount of years\nEspecially in these big mid term elections when so many governors' seats are up I'm a mid mid term elections are really bad historically for the party in power and the White House\nAnd there is a sort of a bleed down effect where a voter is take out there are aggressions\nOn the party controlling the White House in some of the state races and so it's very common\nLike you know any a balmy years the Democrats terribly in terms of governor's race in state legislatures and um now what we're seeing this is the first midterm under Trump [noise] um and ah if things go as as a seems seems seems to be expected\nThat the Democrats should gain the question is uh\nIs the degree of that game will be just a small number of seats or will it be a larger number\nIn and I was asking the question about state legislatures and pushing on the number of governorship governorships because we had former attorney general Eric Holder on the show or a little while back in right now he's big effort he's the chairman of the national democratic redistricting committee\nAnd they've been very focused on state legislatures and governors ships because um well the election is\nEighteen they're focused on the redistricting effort and that happens after the after the twenty twenty cents is and how that plays a part in redrawing congressional districts and the party in power in the governor's mansion in in the state legislatures are the ones who control\nHow those districts are drawn to that's why\nThese state races are also very embarrassing very very important not fully yeah I'm\nA uh the the cycle that we're in right now which are the the uh the uh twenty Eighteen cycle go back ... I'm a a total of eight years and then even before that sixteen years\nTo control how do districts are drawn to that's why you see it raises are also very very very very important not slowly yeah I'm\nA uh the the cycle that we're in right now which are the uh the uh the uh twenty Eighteen cycle go back ... I'm a a total of eight years and then even before that sixteen years ago a lot of the the sort of ground level\nUm structural issues for for the Republicans actually stem back\nReally as far as two thousand two it's sort of weird so in two thousand two came in the recession and voters in a really large number of states throughout the incumbents because there were states fiscal crises and they were very dissatisfied with their state government\nUm and uh it was a strange pattern blue states went red and red states went blue\nThose governors who were elected in two thousand two for the most part served eight years two terms they were out in twenty ten and twenty ten huge GOP wave here so you had a lot of states I'm ah in twenty ten that are sort of purple states maybe even bluer states\nUm ah they actually chose GOP governors that year a lot of them and that was sort of the basis for why there are so many GOP governor is\nNow because they are they actually won in twenty times strong GOP are now those guys for the most part of being turned out a after two terms and so they're a ton of open seats for the for the governorships this year I'm giving the Democrats a lot of opportunity to complete to compete in places like say Iowa\nAnd Ohio and Michigan and Maine states which are sort of ... um and they lost ground and twenty ten and now they have a fresh chance in a much better democratic environment um to actually win a lot of those seats back\nFor the for the governorships this year I'm giving the Democrats a lot of opportunity to complete to compete\nIn places like say Iowa and Ohio and Michigan and Maine states which are sort of ... um and they lost ground in twenty ten and now they they have a fresh chance in a much better democratic environment um to actually win a lot of those seats back\nAll right we'll lose my last question for you and I'm not making a yes or no ah this blue wave that everyone's been talking about that certainly Democrats are hoping will happen from from", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "31"}
