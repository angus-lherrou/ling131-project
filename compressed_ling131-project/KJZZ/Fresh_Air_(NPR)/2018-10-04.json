Senate tomorrow\nAnd according to Senate Democratic wick whip Dick Durbin only one copy of the report is being delivered and each party will have to take turns viewing it\nIn one hour increment alternating between the parties this means it could take days if all one hundred senators want to see it\nListeners here's our question for you tonight how do you feel about this whole process are you satisfied that the FBI investigation will answer your remaining questions about judge Kavanaugh\nOr do you not have any questions at this point or are you just sick and tired of the whole thing call

for seven four five eight to\nFive five and joining us now from Washington is New York times congressional reporter Sheryl ...\nCheryl I Can't think of any body better to speak with tonight and then you let's start by reading a tweet tonight from Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy a Democrat and get your reaction and Cheryl let me first say thank you so much for being with us some\nHappy to be here\nAll right so here's what Chris Murphy tweeted out less than an hour ago quote one copy of the FBI report no more than an hour or two of us know ability for any follow up\nDinner rush to vote for two years McConnell has been carefully and purposefully breaking the Senate this is the final blow no comedy or tradition last each jumps to bounce power politics end quote and sweet so Cheryl what do we know about this\nStrange planned to view the FBI report in the hour long increments says\nWell I think we know that Mitch McConnell is really um determined to get this vote done this week on Brett Kavanaugh thought Democrats are really angry as you heard no choice for senator Murphy they remember well\nAlong the way the interminable delay that McConnell imposed on the Senate\nWhen Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama and they remain furious about that um but Senator McConnell has said repeatedly that\nThis week on Brett Kavanaugh are Democrats are really angry as you heard from a tweet from Senator Murphy they remember well along the way the interminable delay that McConnell imposed on the Senate\nWhen Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama and they remain furious about that um but Senator McConnell has said repeatedly that the Senate will vote this week we know that the um report the it's actually going to be a\nCollection of reports it will be a stack of what's known as three oh two so those are documents reflecting interview notes from various witnesses those documents will be delivered to the Senate\nProbably later tonight but nobody is going to get to view them until tomorrow morning\nRight in two of those witnesses do not include as far as our reporting reveals a the principals here but they did testify in front of the Senate under oath ah\nBrett Kavanaugh and uh and and Dr lousy Ford\nOr do you think this is going to be enough to satisfy key senators like Jeff Flake and the other two Republican Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the ones who insisted on this report before a full Senate vote\nWell we'll have to say what the what the results are I think that the FBI\nAnd the Republicans can probably make a pretty decent case that Dr block the Ford and Brett Kavanaugh gave testimony over a long a day in in the Senate and so it was more important to hear from these other witnesses potentially cooperating witnesses\nSaw than it was from them since their views were\nWell known nonetheless Democrats are ready laying the groundwork to make an argument\nNew case that Dr block the Ford and Brett Kavanaugh gave testimony over long a day in in the Senate and so it was more important to hear from these other witnesses potentially cooperating witnesses by then it was from them since their views were\nWell known nonetheless Democrats are ready laying the groundwork to make an argument that this is a sham\nInvestigation that the two of them the two principal should've been interviewed\nUm whether that will sway the three Republicans I'm I don't know as we know Jeff Flake said\nAh last friday that he was inclined to vote he was going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nThan he had this encounter with female protestors in an elevator he heard their cries he felt\nThe country was being ripped apart and so he kind of did an about face and asked for this FBI investigation but I think barring anything really surprising I Would think at least Jeff Flake will be voting for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd as you say he encountered those two women in the elevator in addition to that there has been considerable negative reaction to President Trump's mocking of Dr ... Ford Brett Kavanaugh's accuser last night at a political rally in Mississippi\nI had one right I Am wondering\nWell you'd think it was always wonder how did you get home I don't remember how did you guess are don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was\n[noise] I don't know [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know\nI Wonder well you know there was wonder how did you get home I don't remember how did you just don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want to I don't\nKnow [noise] I don't know [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where's upstairs downstairs where was I don't know but I Wonder you\nKnow we can hear Trump supporters in the crowd cheering him on bought those critical Republican senators on Capitol Hill did not seem please today here's Maine's Susan Collins\nAre you comfortable the president's attacks on Christians Bobby board or your brother the budget advisors and be president comment word just plain wrong\nAnd Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski\nAnd I think that the president's comments yesterday ... doctor toward were totally inappropriate and in my view unacceptable\nAnd here is notably Arizona's Jeff Flake on the today\nShow where I live there's there's no time and no place for a large part to discuss something [noise] [noise]\nRight right I Wish we had to do that [noise]\n[noise] [noise] so we were speaking a Cheryl gay soul work of the New York times about a critically Jeff Flake who are clearly is very conflicted was even before\nA the weekend and now is it seems being pushed a further and further on this issue and then of course the two female Republican senators I Mitch McConnell are clearly as you say wants to close this vote\nAbout a critically Jeff Flake who are clearly is very conflicted was even before a the weekend and now is it seems being pushed a further and further\nOn this issue and then of course the two female Republican senators I Mitch McConnell a it was clearly as you say wants to close this vote\n'em maybe he takes a risk bringing the vote to the floor if if he's not certain to have the numbers he needs\nWell one way or the other he's got a breaking the vote to on the floor I Would note that Jeff Flake told me today that he would not allow President Trump's comments to\nInfluence his vote one way or the other he said you can't you know he was he wasn't happy about those comments but it's not going to sway his vote and I think at this point it's some I don't want to say put up\nOr shut up time I mean they've got to have this vote\nAnd either Brett Kavanaugh's confirmed or he's not and so I'm McConnell is prepared to move forward with it I think McConnell is probably pretty confident that\nEven a narrowly divided Senate that he can get Kavanaugh through it's possible that we could see a fifty fifty split and vice president Mike Pence would have to come in\nAnd break a tie a that would be unprecedented certainly I'm In modern Senate history I I Can't speak for the all the way back to the founding of the republic but that's never happened before\nAnd any sense finally Cheryl on the timing will it be tomorrow will be friday will be over the weekend I Can't imagine it will drag on until Monday\n[noise] no probably not so if the report is delivered tonight then\nAnd modern Senate history I Can't speak for the all the way back to the founding of the republic but that never happened before\nAnd any sense finally Cheryl on the timing will it be tomorrow will be friday will be over the weekend I Can't imagine it will drag on until Monday\n[noise] no probably not so if the report is delivered tonight then Senator McConnell has said he will file cloture that is basically Senate jargon for um initiating debate so he has said that once the report\nLands in the Senate he is going to do that that will start us thirty our clock ticking they're thirty hours of debate I'm so presumably a vote or to cut off debate could happen on\nScreening the argument on the other side is that he was if you feel when he was justified and Clarence Thomas made similar expressions\nScrewed the argument on the other side is that uh he was hit us and he was justified and Clarence Thomas mood similar expressions that shit and another child but the truth is that even people like flight and what isn't there were there are conservatives who were concerned expressions of both of partisanship\nJeffrey Rosen I Do hope you'll come back as his constitutional conversation continues that's Jeffrey Rosen CEO of the non partisan constitution

skies a higher eighty five for your weekend eighty six on Saturday Seventy eight on Sunday\n[noise]\nMine Jimi Floyd and you're listening to America on the line alive at news and Colin children's\nWNYC and public radio stations across the nation we turn now to a story that on any other day would be leading this broadcast\nThe New York times that dropped a bombshell report late yesterday on line and on its front page today that concludes based on one hundred thousand to documents and some interviews to that President Trump's father gave his son Donald Trump hundreds of millions of dollars over the years\nNow Trump is portrayed himself as a self made billionaire with a knack for the real estate market who received only a small loan of one million dollars from his father to start off the times story attacks that notion\nAnd almost as newsworthy the White House response makes very little attempt to challenge it joining us now to discuss this unfolding story is WNYC is Andrea Bernstein and she is\nSenior editor for politics and policy here at WNYC and she's the co host of the podcast Trump ink which is produced in partnership with ProPublica\nAndrea hey hey Jamie\nSo I Know you have now had a day or so to pour over this vast I guess Fifteen thousand were coal ah it's a pretty detailed and it impart alleges that President Trump avoided paying taxes on properties acquired from his father that's just part of it right\nIs just part of it and by the New York times estimate his family paid a about a tenth of the ...\nDay or so to pour over this vast I guess Fifteen thousand were coal ah it's pretty detailed and eat impart alleges that President Trump avoided paying taxes on properties acquired from his father that's just part of it right\nThat is just part of it and by the New York times estimate his family paid a about a tenth of the taxes that they should have paid or if they had declared the true value of their properties\n... what was your reaction when you saw this I mean so many documents tax returns receipts it was pretty wild\nYeah I mean it's obviously a formidable effort by the New York times journalist who read through all these documents and it and it fills in a lot of the sort of holes in the history I mean there were a lot of terrific biographers of Donald Trump who have documented over the years how\nA Donald Trump has got money from his father I mean there is a story that I is a repeated in his New York times story that's widely known about when Donald Trump's casinos in Atlantic City were failing his father sent an ... an\nEmissary to buy three million dollars over three million dollars in casino chips which were then never used which was\nIn essence of three million dollar loan so there's been a a stories about this but the ... and the debt than I think most striking for me was the\nDetail in which the sort of having it both ways of the uh Trump family airs both claiming their properties will work very little and then for example when they were going to be taxed on them\nBut then claiming they were worth a great deal when they wanted people to buy it\nAnd this is really quite a stunning a confident uh and and\nThe detail in which the sort of having it both ways of the uh Trump family airs both claiming their properties will work very little and then for example when they were going to be taxed on them but then claiming they were worth a great deal when they want people to buy it\nAnd this is really quite a ... a stunning a confident uh and and rather massive a conclusion by the New York times I mean the first sentence just comes right out and accuses the president\nI quote outright fraud is the is the sentence by that starts off this massive report I we can't go through all of it but what really stood out to you Andrew\nWell I mean I think what is interesting about all of this ... the volume of obviously the\nThe two hundred and Ninety five revenue streams uh the way that there were just all kinds of ways of creating money flows to Donald Trump and his siblings in many ways that they could evade or as a New York times says defraud tax authorities so\nThat really stood out but in in\nCovering Trump's businesses as we have done for the past couple of years on the Trump in podcast we have heard claims over and over again a consistent pattern of outright lies defrauding buyer there've been\nHundreds if not actually thousands of civil suits against a Donald Trump and in some cases has children in some cases his business\nFor lying to buyers for example in condo projects so the the it does it is striking to me the similarity between what the New York times documents here and what the Trump family has been accused of and the businesses have been accused of over the years right it dovetails a entirely\nAgainst a Donald Trump and in some cases has children in some cases his business for lying to buyers for example in condo projects\nSo to the it does\nIt is striking to me the similarity between what the New York times documents here and what the Trump family has been accused of and the businesses have been accused of over the years\nRight it dovetails a entirely with all the report Hodge including\nYours that Trump and came right back to the amazing claim that baby Trump Baby Donald Trump was getting two hundred thousand dollars per year as an infant let let's bring in more and leader she's the co founder and CEO of all in together it's a nonpartisan woman's organization\nA dedicated to civic engagement\nAmongst women Lauren uh I Know you've worked on a ...\nAh with with ah Letitia James on issues related to tax the ending engagement for the New York state tax department which has reportedly looking into the New York times investigation I think\nA statute of limitations will have run\nA with regard to most of the claims in the times the so I'm going to acknowledge to both of you that I Am still winding my way to win thing I guess it's the proper grammatical words or through the Fifteen thousand words are in the times these\nI and many of the documents but um do you think ah Lauren that\nThis matters in the end I mean we have people on the left\nOut with their heels dug in and people on the right or looking at the New York times with the I won't use the phrase Trump President Trump uses but they have a their land their political lens or we own our separate chambers Yellen ... yelling at each other out with the facts we believe to be true\nA Lauren that this matters in the end I mean we have people on the left\nOut with their heels again and people on the right or looking at the New York times with the I won't use the phrase Trump President Trump uses but they have a their land their political lens or we own our separate chambers Yellen ... yelling at each other out with the facts we believe to be true\nWell thanks for having me first I just have to correct one thing I have not ... I'm Sorry I I don't want to confuse anyone she's speaking at a woman in financial services event that on together is hosting and New York in a couple of weeks and so I'll be really interested to hear what\nShe has to say about it so just to correct that out of the gate but I Will say this I think that part of what is so complicated about this drip drip drip and then in this case is sort of avalanche of reporting on\nFraud and implications of wrongdoing and add that on top of the constantly growing daily barrage of a controversial issues that surround this White House\nIt's an incredibly difficult uh amount of information for average voters to sort through and I think what I worry about is that in\nDespite the surge of civic engagement certainly that we're seeing among women on the left which I think is a unquestionable there's record numbers of women running record numbers of women protesting calling their members of Congress are reaching out volunteering getting involved in the mid term elections\nI I Do worry about the sort of average voters ability to process this much stuff\nAnd to make decisions about it and I do think that the in the local and state elections that we're going to see in November I Do think for the next number of weeks we're going to the candidates across the board using this New York times story and then of course using and leveraging the cabinet controversy to really\nI I Do worry about the sort of average voters ability to process this much stuff\nAnd to make decisions about it and I do think that the in the local and state elections that we are going to see in November I Do think for the next number of weeks we're gonna see candidates across the board using this New York times story and then of course\nUsing and leveraging the cabinet controversy to really make every election in the country an election about Donald Trump or in hundreds of places where he's not running\nAndrea your thoughts as our ... our uh editor on politics and policy as as well as our trumping cohost what are your thoughts on the impact of a story like this on politics at the polls\nWell I think if we've learned anything in the past couple of years uh we should be cautious about trying to understand how things are going to affect voting patterns I mean I think that\nI'm One of the important ways to do this is that this is an administration that is hostile to transparency the president to partying with all of their presidents in modern history has not released his tax returns\n\nAnd this is Jay Jay's easy Ninety One point five good

Senator Ted Cruz and the contest for cruises Senate seats this is the first poll that has all roar ahead\nJoining us now from my mother's home town of San Antonio Texas is it okay to learn us where he

that if you are voting in Texas in the midterms please call us up we'd love to hear from you rotate myself aid for for seven four or five eight to five five we have heard for years that Texas\nIs on the verge of turning from deep red to blue or at least perhaps located to purple thanks to changing demographics in your state might this be the year let's start with the Senate race between Ted Cruz and challenger Beto O'Rourke and we're here\nTo support the second amendment [noise]\nIn what way in one respect and named one judge you never supported who would actually uh orange or might not\nAround the house and Senate work but it's your job in the Senate to decide if you're going to support or not support but given your daughter sorry Clinton not not not in my door so that has nothing to drain the promised land I Want to learn how to ask her mind gentlemen\nLet's move on here [noise] All right let's [laughter]\nLet's we'll fly you're certainly have an a heck of a race race out there in Texas that was a clip from the congressional debate in Dallas a few weeks ago senatorial debate we should say\nAnd it really has been heated we said that that show has finally a been a headache and at least one poll but generally how the race has been going how's he been polling is is it really a chance he's gonna win it\nWill always sort of all over the place I mean you have that one poll that showing 'em up or what is it two or three points then you also have the\n... with the Quinnipiac poll putting cruise up nine points um and I think look to the bottom line here uh you know polling I think can lead to a lot of sort of fall\nWell the polling sort of all over the place I mean you have that one poll that showing 'em up or what is it two or three points then you also have the\nI always botch the pronunciation of the Quinnipiac poll putting cruise up nine points um and I think look to the bottom line here uh you know\nPolling I think can lead to a lot of sort of faulty prediction ... definitely right but it's definitely true that it's a lot closer than anyone had any reason to expect are certainly a year ago\nOr even a few months ago I mean I think one of the things that bloom Rourke has really done if the drive so much energy behind progressive in Texas and really mobilized that base for the Democrats in a way that kind of is giving a party a little bit more confidence in a way that they haven't show\nI mean I think it's really telling if you look at that race in how competitive he's made it but then if you look elsewhere you know you don't really see a lot of the more prominent democratic members of the establishment throwing their\nHats into the statewide races this time around the rugs actually kind of unique for really trying to take that chance and move the needle so I think whether or not a ... wins this race\nThink she's doing a lot for the Democratic party in Texas and for the party's future you know I mean there for him to win would be a pretty massive achievement given how badly the party is done here in recent elections but for him to lose well\nUh I think is also really closing the gap I mean we have to remember that Wendy Davis left the governor's race and twenty fourteen but like twenty points spread\nRight tried and as you suggest he's he's polling well but he's big challenge a ease voter turnout you've reported quote white non Hispanics make up just forty two percent\nElections but for him to lose well uh I think is also really closing the gap I mean we have to remember that Wendy Davis lost the governor's race and twenty fourteen but like twenty points spread\nRight tried and as you suggest he's he's polling well but he's big challenge\nA ease voter turnout you've reported quote white non Hispanics make up just forty two percent of the taxes population mirroring the demographics of solidly blue California\nBut Latinos have historically low voter turnout rate so so why is that are okay and how much of an impact is it going to have on the race in the event\nWas huge I mean if if but or once the when he was going to have to win by driving up Hispanic turnout and by winning a larger share of those Hispanics who do turn out if if the demographics look the way they did last a midterm election\nUh she's not going to win like it's a the math and very obvious but the issue here right is that Texas has some issues with the Latino vote that I think are are very important for the public outside the state to understand uh you know people have a sort of tendency\nTo look at the low levels of Latino voter turnout\nAcross the nation either and to sort of scratch their heads and say you know why why are these folks not\nExercising their civic duty when there's someone like Trump and office who's making very aggressive comments against immigrants or Mexicans broadly that many people in the Latino community do feel are offensive\nOr threatening but you know it takes a certain sense of entitlement and I say this in the in the best possible signs of that word right to say that if something uh\nKnow if if political leaders are being aggressive against you that your guest\nWhen there's someone like Trump and office who's making very aggressive comments against immigrants or Mexicans broadly that many people in the Latino community do feel are offensive or threatening but you know it takes a certain sense of entitlement and I say this in the in the best possible sense of that word right to say that if something\nUh you know if if the political leaders are being aggressive against you that your response is going to be to go out and participate in public life and get yourself in the city council and start changing these things right I think for people that are alienated from civic process\nFor people that may come from recent immigrant backgrounds are have mixed status families if you are not involved in civics process\nUh having someone a speak so negatively or with such hostility toward your community might simply real from your in your your it's sort of decision to kind of stay kind of keep your head down you know you hear this over and over again\nWhen you're talking particularly to a young folks right that they get that message a lock on their parents\nAre right and ... get ahead go ahead and one of ... I\nGerrymandering and and and and voter suppression\nAnd voter id requirements the things we do hear about here in other states these heavy taxes\nAre certainly an issue you have gerrymandering you've also had historically in some uh uh parts of taxes you know a a at large motor districts the diluted this panic mode that had to be challenging the courts\nOr the state voter id requirement which I'm certainly a conclude that span of ... and\nThen also other aspects of the system that are a little bit last a sort of highly politicized like for example in South Texas where you have\nA very large Hispanic\nAt large voter district the diluted this panic mode that had to be challenging the courts or the state voter id requirement of which ah I'd certainly a can deliver Hispanic vote and then also other aspects of the system that are a little bit less a sort of\nHighly politicized like for example in South Texas where\nA very large Hispanic population getting toward the border towns that are you know Ninety plus percent\nHispanic notion solidly democratic that they're racist aren't competitive and so you don't see the you know that fundamental dynamic driving people or to the polls so again I think what O'Rourke is trying to do and not be successful at will\nGive a quite a benefit to the Democratic party moving forward is to give people a reason\nOr to get to the ... to get to the polls he's you know he's putting a race that no one had any reason to suspect would be in play and play\nNow now immigration of course there's a huge issue in the upcoming midterms but I Would guess in taxes and it's more important or at least arguably more important than any other state and you know President Trump continues to play up the year's around the issue like Ted Cruz is running on an anti immigration pro law enforcement\nPlatform but back to doing just the opposite to laying out on a sort of progressive message about immigration and immigrants how how is that issue playing out with voters in Texas", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "04"}
