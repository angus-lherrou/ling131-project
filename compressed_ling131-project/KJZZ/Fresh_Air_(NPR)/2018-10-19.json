ah\nFrom all that I've looked at Democrats are\nLikely to hold their noses and vote for him because they are concerned about Donald Trump and um you know the the biggest problem the Democrats face with Bob Menendez\nBesides the fact that they didn't offer up a candidate to primary in ... when they should have is\nThat the Democratic seats in the house that are up for reelection aren't competitive races so your ... your democratic strongholds in the state aren't going to see the kind of turnout that we're going to see in the five Republican held districts where the turnout is you know they're expecting a democratic surge\nAnd so that's gonna hurt Menendez but uh I think when all is said and done I think he's going to get out\nOkay well I Want to come back for more details because this was really turned into a a nasty race even even buying New Jersey's stance let's go to Missouri now an Allison height of the Kansas City star or thanks for joining us Allison appreciate it thanks for having me\nWell let's talk about what's going on in in in Missouri right now I'm Claire McCaskill always seems to be in sort of apparel is you know the perils of Pauline always seems to be waging uphill fight 'em how she faring as of right now\n[noise] right well Missouri is a state that voted for president Donald Trump by something like Nineteen points so um it's a difficult state for a Democrat to win is as one of the most important Senate races in the country when it the closest Senate races in the country I'm In right now it looks like an absolute toss up the cook Political Report has it as a toss up the last poll I saw\nHad Holly ... polling at forty five and McCaskill at forty four\nFaring as of right now right well Missouri is a state that voted for president Donald Trump by something like Nineteen points so um it's a difficult state for a Democrat to win is as one of the most important Senate races in the country when it the closest Senate races in the country\nI'm In right now it looks like an absolute toss up the cook Political Report has it as a toss up the last poll I saw\nHad Holly ... polling at forty five and McCaskill at forty four\nInterestingly in that poll they asked undecided voters are voters that didn't answer where they were leaning and got the exact same answer Holly forty five McCaskill forty four\nSo it's a very very tight race um and pretty much every poll that we've seen is within the margin of error um it's also one of the most expensive Senate races this cycle of the center for Responsive Politics\nHad as a second overall most expensive race and the most expensive race in terms of outside spending\nAnd the closer we get to election day I'm the nasty or it gets you know we've got\nJust an onslaught of political ads the ads against Holly or calling him you know a lot of climbing politician and the ... golden boy they've been going after him over health care and the ads against one call a McCaskill are accusing her being out of touch with Missouri\nI'm Holly campaign of trying to pin McCaskill two Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority leader Nancy Pelosi um he's been on a stop Schumer fire Claire to wear and his campaign bus has um himself on obviously and then McCaskill Schumer and Pelosi\nAnd of course now we have an undercover video which apparently we can't have a campaign without one of those who are eligible to come back to the ... and just lose the moment and finally I Want to go out to a Las Vegas in the ... of the Nevada\nIndependent um look I mean there are a lot of states that have crazy politics but uh I mean you're right up there [laughter] that is one of that one of the crazier\nStates to cover that's for sure but yeah we have one of that one of the craziest Senate races this cycle I'm\nAndrew governor's race was pretty nuts to it at our governor's race\nJust just a moment in front me I Want to go to a Los Vegas into making measurably of the Nevada independent um look I mean there are a lot of states that have crazy politics but uh I mean you're right up there [laughter] about it is one of that\nOne of the crazier states to cover that's for sure but yeah we have one of the one of the craziest Senate races this cycle I'm\nIn the governor's race was pretty nuts [laughter]\nAnd our governor's races crazy too yeah we have quite quite a lot going on out here in in the west\nWas talking about their lives so but the Senate race because a lot a lot of Democrats voted the incoming Republican Dean Heller was dead men walking that this was\nThe number one and number two biggest pick up the prospect for them um the last poll I saw would suggest that ... is head or even but what are you looking at\nSo a lot of the whole so far the cycle of really had the two candidates you know Heller out by a few rows and up by a few but within the margin of error so not really you know statistically significant\nThere was one poll recently where how there was a little bit ahead but everyone on the ground here really think it's still a toss up you know this could go either direction but like you mentioned\nYou know Heller was considered the most vulnerable or we'll ... we'll never will Republican and the Senate and and he still is but he's actually been able to get around some of the issues that were really big Sorenson inside\nAt the beginning of the campaign one of the big issues that Jackie rather than who is a political newcomer she the first time Congress woman she was recruited by Harry Reid to run for the house and twenty sixteen so she doesn't have a lot of experience but she's been going after Heller really hard on health care um Heller with one of those\nSenators who came out initially when Senate Republicans were debating repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act and said you know no I have some concerns about this but then he eventually voted for that motion to proceed voted for the skinny repeal of the Affordable CARE Act to get rid of the individual mandate so Jacky Rosen thing going after him\nIf you read to run for the house and twenty sixteen so she doesn't have a lot of experience but she's been going after Heller really hard on health care um Heller was one of those senators\nWho came out initially when Senate Republicans were debating repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act and said you know no I have some concerns about this but then he eventually voted for that motion to proceed voted for the skinny repeal of the Affordable CARE Act to get rid of the individual mandate\nSo Jacky Rosen thing going after him saying you know you flip flopped on the Affordable CARE Act she's been running these really memorable ad featuring this orange inflatable to man the kind of thing you see outside the car repair shop as sort of come here a type deal she's been running ads accusing him of being senator spineless sort of saying he's been blowing with the winds of Washington and\nThat sort of been her biggest attack against him is that he's caved to Senate Republican leadership and he came to president Donald Trump going against the ... best interests of did that and and what's interesting about that it's ... actually said that he was Ninety nine percent opposed to Donald Trump during the\n... election he's been slowly warming to the president over the last two years on you know it was really happy about tax reform and campaigning on that issue\nSo Jackie Rosen's in sort of trying to keep her her head above water\nAnd and sort of just run a a straightforward campaign and the biggest attack ... thing against her as the fact that she's a political newcomer again running ads against her things she's accomplished zero\nAnd the bureaucracy I'm getting stronger so I'm I'm a very pragmatic in the Senate I'm voting for I\nThink maybe for the call and then that's that's what you were describing a little bit before Nancy that that does the go to the real politics that you're seeing from a lot a lot of voters or\nWas it a you know thanks to all three of you for being here in America on long we have to go to a break and when we come back how

it does doesn't it more [laughter] I think so um so where where should we begin and we we we have so much you know town you know what I Want to start with something that I'm slowly obsessed about\nI'm a little bit obsessed about a story that I don't think he's getting um is getting as much attention as it ought to Steve King Republican congressman from Iowa for reasons best known to him so\nJust decided to endorse a candidate for mayor in Toronto who is I was on a show a little bit earlier this today which is described as a white nationalist which does not really captured\nUm faith goldie is really somebody that works with neo Nazis she was fired from her very right wing website job because she insisted on going on the Daily Stormer I mean this is somebody who ... the infamous fourteen words\nAnd yet for some reason this doesn't seem to be generating the kind of reaction that you would have I think in other news cycles given Steve kings prominence in in in Republican politics and in in in Congress\nAnd I'm certainly not seeing and I I maybe I missed it but I don't see\nComments from other Republicans around the country saying I'm this is beyond the pale so\n... we'll start with you on all of this um you Steve King is and and we could go through all the things that that faith goldie stands for but I mean here you have a senior Republican member of Congress who is essentially endorsing a neo Nazi\nAnd it's consistent with some of the other things that we've known about Steve King over the years she's made other comments that were really a disgraceful\nHey also Mona we'll start with you on all of this um you Steve King is and if we could go through all the things that that faith goldie stands for but I mean here you have a senior Republican member of Congress who is essentially endorsing a neo Nazi\nAnd it's consistent with some of the other things that we've known about Steve King over the years he's made other comments that were really a disgraceful [noise]\nUm but you know he's he has an opponent and his opponent jade de ... not very much political experience perhaps but he's gotten a ton of money from people who find um\nKing offensive and I'm I'm waiting I looked on line that I haven't seen the ads highlighting this latest outrage from a\nFrom the Steve King from his opponent I Would expect that would be the first place to start let voters of Iowa know what's going on but\nAlso I Would expect that there would be people calling up other Republicans say what do you think about this so what do what he wants to capitalize what are your your your take on I ... I have a theory this kind of depressing but\nOkay after any explanation of this will be depressing look Trump ... has been flirting with neo Nazis or for the last couple of years starting at least with when he initially did not just on the endorsement from David Duke\nUh so the idea that this would be like beyond the over to the window at this point I I think is is sadly a little ridiculous right like we have become accustomed to the\nThat's exactly that's exactly what my theory was going to be that that having seen all the things that were considered quote unquote acceptable to two years ago that we have in fact move the window of acceptability that was something that would have been a massive controversy just a couple of years ago is is not and apparently\nIt and it doesn't appear to shock the conscience of of Republicans who apparently been ignored to this\n... fatty that's exactly that's exactly what my theory was going to be that that having seen all the things that were considered quote unquote acceptable to two years ago that we have in fact move the window of acceptability that was something that would have been a massive controversy just a couple of years ago is is not and apparently\nIt and it doesn't appear to shock the conscience of of Republicans who apparently have been ignored to this kind of you know hyper racial\nLines and and I also agree with that and it's sort of on brand in some sense yes Steve King in particular\nMaria it's the normal life you know the normalizing of it right it's it's absolutely the number of it the normalizing of it um regarding Steve King I'm I was recently in his district about a year ago that somewhat recent in political terms um he's his district is majority Latino in Iowa\nMajority Latino residents I Know your eyes are pirate yeah not not voters and but in terms of you know the fastest growing demographic in Iowa hello Latinos and ...\nJust in terms of context by the way I also met a Latino there who was pro Trump so just a little bit of context but in terms of\nWhat I'm ... this notion of a it's it's normalizing white supremacy\nNow on the other side you know before you could not say the word white supremacy without just just this kind of horror of people like I have to we have to talk about white supremacy we have to talk about what it looks like structurally and what this raises is\nPrecisely the question that you're asking Charlie why is it that people are not speaking out about you let me\nRespond to that I don't disagree with you but I think that it that often in terms of racism and white rooms are thrown around so much that people have a nominee effect so that when the real thing I mean we're talking about an actual neo Nazi\nWe have to talk about what it looks like structurally and what this raises is precisely the question that you're asking Charlie why is it that people are not speaking out about you let me\nRespond to that I don't disagree with you but I think that\nIt that often in terms of what the racism and white rooms are thrown around so much that people have a ... when the real thing I mean you're talking about an actual neo Nazi white nationalist comes along\nThat we don't we don't calibrate our responses in the in the same way because this is I mean this is this is something that that ought not to be you know not to be controversial does not close call here\nWhere I don't think the problem is that we're too quick to call the now I I really don't and and and frankly that like people don't walk around throwing the term white supremacy it\nI'm a journalist I have an analysis I'm looking at things structurally I'm hearing what people are saying most people are not out there saying that so I I Want to caution about well everybody's kind of I don't I don't agree\nI Do I disagree with my esteemed colleagues on this I actually think that there has been a a permit skew his use of terms like white supremacy\nAnd racism over the years and I think even some you know conscientious liberals have acknowledged it and the era of Trump and said you know we called\nMitt Romney racist and we called John McCain or racist and that was unjust and you know we regret it now because now we really need the term to have the same moral force a and it doesn't because there there's the boy who cried wolf problem and now there's a real wolf\nOkay I Want to move on and we'll live so many things I'm I'm Sorry but I sort of took us off on a ... I'm Kevin I Want to talk to you about ... about money and read about it\nThe Saudi money issue this obsession that Donald Trump has with how much economic value the Saudi Arabian connection has for us in in ... tell me about that and and how\nAnd now there's a real wolf\nWill go on a ... life so many things I'm I'm Sorry but I sort of took us off on an on on on that direction I'm Kevin I Want to talk to you about ... about money and what about the Saudi money issue this obsession that Donald Trump has with how much economic value\nThe Saudi Arabian connection has four hours in in ... to tell me about that and and how\nDeeply it appears to be influencing the administration's response to the brutal murder of ...\nI Would say that the United states has always had to some extent a naked like transactional relationship with the Saudis but\nShould Trump that's like a virtue right meat and he he sort of believes that the fact that he doesn't prioritize American values that instead he prioritizes American economic interests are financial interest\nThat's a good thing and you know a lot of his supporters believe that as well I mean they they said he's not even a logical that's a great thing he can make great deals for us well he's focusing on the great deal he's not focusing on our values\nAnd that's a problem clearly a\nAnd we as a country should be promoting our values around the world and holding our trading partners and anybody we had any sort of relationship with Sheila count when they fall short\nBut Trump has openly said I mean there is some sort of the tape bring over at like well let's come up with some other excuse about why do you want to maintain his relationship he just comes out and says now we're getting money from them that's a good thing\nSo motives that is is is that just honesty or is he just being more honest about something that's been the reality for four years is is it is is that not a departure that we should be concerned about\nIs that just honesty I is he just being more honest about something that's been the reality for four years is is it is is that not a departure that we should be concerned about\nWould have to take a break here and we're gonna be back with us panel and we ... we promise we'll take more of your calls in just a moment you're listening to America on the line [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is ...

I'm back a brilliant panel\nLatino USA host Maria host of the Washington Post Catherine Rampell in Washington columnist and author of ... and I promise we'll be taking your calls in the segment to and here's a question I mentioned this poll commissioned by Republicans that concluded that\nThis election is really not about the economy stupid it's not about other things it is about how people feel about President Trump's so do you agree\nOr they're in a positive or negative way would you vote are you voting for or against Donald Trump or is there another reasons you can call it an aid for for seven four or five talk that aid for for seven four or five eighty two fifty five okay just the question with his family in his me to hear\nHow do you think it is that the Republicans work the Kavanaugh's confirmation or how they they flip the script on this how did it become a story about mob rule smear tactics and and the and the smearing of of an innocent man well Christine Blasey Ford who everybody said was credible and compelling when she was testify has really just disappeared as a factor I mean it is\nBeing a couple of weeks and that almost seems to be invisible so I mean is this is this how Republicans win the battle is no more I I Know you may have a different perspective on all of this\n[noise] yes I um I actually think this was bundling on the part of the Democrats um they piled on too much they embraced um implausible and even outlandish accusations along with a serious accusation that is Ford's and by so doing they diluted the strength\nThis is how Republicans win the battle is no more I I Know you may have a different perspective on all\nOf this [noise] yes I um I actually think this was ... on the part of the Democrats um they piled on too much\nThey embraced um implausible and even outlandish accusations along with a serious accusation that his forwards\nAnd by so doing they diluted the strength of her accusation and they allowed I'm both a Kavanaugh and other Republicans to say well the Democrats are just flinging all of this mud and they and Michael ... was a gift to them\nUp so that they could then just say throw in the Ford accusation with the less credible ones and um and deny that any of them had credibility Jasmine\nI it's true if you had asked me a couple of months ago if I thought it would be good for Republicans to have their Supreme Court pick a credibly accused of sexual assault I would've said absolutely not no there's no conceivable universe in which this could be a political positive and clearly it has been it has become such a thing\nUm I think it's it may be partly that Democrats and you know did give too much weight to the to like the ... claim which had to be walked back\nBut I think it's also that Republicans are just willing to play dirty or to some extent and Trump himself you know he was warned don't attack a lousy Ford's credibility don't attack her personally and initially he didn't\nBut it to some extent maybe it was the turning point that he went after her directly that he that he doesn't have any qualms about attacking a credible victim of sexual assault and\nAnd that's affecting somehow\nI'm I think a lot of women I'm not sure what this is going to mean in terms of the midterms but I think there are a lot of women who are still still kind of trying to catch up with what happened um in terms of the nomination and confirmation\nMaybe it was the turning point that he went after her directly that he that he doesn't have any qualms about attacking a credible chicken or sexual assault in and that's if that somehow\nYou know um I I think a lot of women I'm not sure what this is going to need I mean in terms of the midterms but I think there are a lot of women who are still\nStill kind of trying to catch up with what happened um in terms of the nomination and confirmation of capital on um I mean it's still as I travel across the country since um since he's been confirmed I'm continuing to hear the same thing that women are still coming to terms with things that happened to them um and the kind of shock of it all and again the normalization of\nOf now justice Kavanaugh um but I think that how did this happen that that narrative shifted\nSo I'm I again he brings me no joy to say these things but I think that um if you think about who is actually running America's newsrooms who has a kind of maybe an understanding of let's let's be concerned about the young men in the world America's newsrooms have become\nLess diverse since September eleventh ... they're not more diverse so we have to think about how certain narratives are picked up and and that they become the central narrative which is now now that we have to be concerned about young men as opposed to what women are experiencing so I just I think in terms of a structural perspective\nUm who who's in our newsrooms\nSo there's this this may not relate directly to this but the did you hear the story about Ella magazine online tweeted out this a click bait tweet that the that that the mouse and you know Kanye West and came crashing or breaking up and if and if you clicked on it if you got sucked into that you were sent a voter registration website so\nI guess I'm I'm not clear about is this smart way to get young women to register to vote or is it is it more insulting and condescending\nBut did you hear the story but Ellen magazine online tweeted out this a quick re tweet that the that that than an ounce and you know Kanye West and came crashing or breaking up and if and if you clicked on it if you got sucked into that you were sent a voter registration website so\nI guess I I'm not clear about is this smart way to get young women to register to vote or is it is it more insulting in condescending\nAnd instill [laughter] I don't think in the Senate or the second one is going to be convinced by this who's going to be ... if anything is going to be\nTicked off that they didn't get there click bait and they're going to say well I'm closing that window you know if you actually want people to register to vote and make the case\nFor them to ... manipulate is the last thing that we need the media right now is to be kind of clearly being manipulative that just is not helpful\nI just can't see what the upside is um re I mentioned before that I wanted to talk about the you know race is like for example in in Nevada where um the real big question is is will be Hispanic vote turnout insufficient numbers and there'd been all kinds of stories and surveys\nSuggesting that the Democrats are rushing real anxiety um over a ... on motivated his Hispanic\nOh my God well we'll wait let me stop the oh my goodness wait a second\nDemocrat Democrat the Democratic institutions are concerned\nAbout what's happening with the Latino vote right now how many days we have left to let me get a little late thank you so what's happening is the thing is is that you have to understand that this is ... and again we were just speaking off off Mike about\nYou can't make these huge generalizations about Latino Latino voters across the country I mean this is like a huge group\nFifty million plus people um you know there are Latinos from Utah there are Latinos from Florida and there are a lot of emails from Chicago and we are all very different not monolithic not at all monolithic so but what what is monolithic sadly Charlie\nAnd again we were just speaking off off Mike about you can't make these huge generalizations about Latino Latino voters across the country I mean this is like a huge group\nFifty million plus people um you know there are Latinos from Utah there are Latinos from Florida and there are a lot of emails from Chicago and we are all very different model if not at all monolithic so but what what is monolithic sadly Charlie um is that\nLatinos and letting us across the board understand that we are being targeted\nIt's not like maybe maybe we're being targeted no we understand that Latinos and letting us were born in the United states along the U.S Mexico border\nTheir passports are not being renewed those ... they have coming into renewed their American why are we not seeing this explosion that because of it because you know wait a minute there is also a sense of feeling very much attacked but not\nSpoken to so what
