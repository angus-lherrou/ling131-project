developments there's the progress of the FBI investigation of claims against judge Kavanaugh there's an update on Rod Rosenstein job status\nOh in the New York times is reporting that President Trump appears to have committed tax fraud\nAcclaim denied by Trump's lawyer and also by the White House or a statement that just hit seconds before we went on air from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders oh and now New York state is investigating so another typical slow news day\nLet's turn now to Washington Post reporter amber Phillips amber welcome back to America on the line\nAnd happy to be I'm okay so let's take the the er the last thing first and that is the the latest response from the White House from Sarah Huckabee Sanders about this bombshell New York times story about the ... they're flat out calling a tax fraud\nLet's turn now to Washington Post reporter amber Phillips amber welcome back to America on the line and they're happy to be I'm\nOkay so let's take the the er the last thing first and that is the the latest response from the White House from Sarah Huckabee Sanders about this bombshell New York times story about the ... they're flat out calling a tax fraud\nOr not just a now President Trump but the entire Trump family\nYeah I'm I'm as you said it's coming out of Fort were on the arts them reading it right now it does not look like she Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaking out specifically denies the allegations are the key line here is\nMany decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on those trends accents and then she goes on to attack\nThe New York times uh what's that to just to me is that there's not a clear denial of the things that the New York times accuses\nPresident Trump of doing that being said the New York times that quote Trump lawyer saying a or denying any allegations of actual fraud and tax evasion\nA new one of the ... one of the instant um analysis of this is that\nIt sort of blows a hole into the president's image or that he has perpetuated of himself as\nA self made a self made man who went from queens to Manhattan and made it big and made it bigger than even his own father do you think that that is actually going to have any kind of impact at all on the president's standing\nI have stopped guessing a long time ago well stick with voters with this president um you know I I my own personal theory is if you're on the left and\nMade man who went from queens to Manhattan and made it big and made it bigger than even his own father do you think that that is actually going to have any kind of impact at all on the president's standing\nI have stopped guessing a long time ago stick with the owners with this president um you know I I did my own personal theory is if you're on the left and you don't like president jumped you got any number of things to be mad about to get you to the voting booth the the million dollar question of course is what\nThe Trump base\nFeel about him with all the negative news coverage and if there is something that could sort of pull apart the glue between Trump and his base\nThis is certainly a possibility that you point out this is the complete opposite story that the president's successfully soul to voters in two thousand sixteen then he'll run the country and like he has his Trump empire right yeah and I think go ahead what it was just I wanted to add that like a ... last\nSummer there was also a New York state but the kitchen that charity was run as a fraud and so if you look at these together in the picture of a remarkable lack of integrity of the president's like\nRight now I should also point out that New York state um put out a statement today saying that they're going to be taking a look at some of the the the allegations that are in the New York times report let's move now to do what's going on with the FBI ... of\nThe allegations against judge Kavanaugh Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said today that this whole thing could be wrapped up later today if not tomorrow and Dr Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys have been out have said\nThat they haven't heard from the FBI from a process perspective amber how can how can Senate Republicans actually wrap this up in it\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell said today that this whole thing could be wrapped up later today if not tomorrow and Dr Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys have and now have said\nThat they haven't heard from the FBI from a process prospective amber how can\nHow can Senate Republicans actually wrap this up in it by Wednesday and have anyone believed that this was the process that senators flake Collins Murkowski and and and Coons and others are wanting to have happen\nDoesn't critical political question here and that's the question of also determined judge Kaplan I stay is\nWhenever the FBI investigation wraps up\nOr however salt or not involve the White House was in ... who ever they talk to it to a handful a Republican and Democratic senators and decided they thought it was there and that and they've made very clear he mentioned over the past couple of days\nThey want to their destination\nOr they're pulling out of the deal that to consider voting for cat than I as soon as this week\nSo amber I have a I'm a bit of a not a conspiracy theory but a theory because it involves um again majority leader Mitch McConnell for whom the Senate\nIs um must be protected at all costs\nSo if if it if it's a flawed process one that does not earned the vote of ... and ... particularly Collins Collins and Murkowski and flake in order to confirm judge Kavanaugh his nomination goes down the Republican Party base is enraged\nAnd that gets them to come out and potentially help save\nOr or at least preserve the Republican majority in the Senate and my ...\nWhy would process one that does not earned a vote of ... particularly Collins Collins and Murkowski and flake in order to confirm judge Kavanaugh his nomination goes down the Republican Party base is enraged and that gets them to come out and potentially help save\nOr or at least preserve the Republican majority in the Senate am I going too far in my thinking here\nWell when I'm I'm On the opposite side of what would happen okay in the right we're all trying to guess right here\nIs cabinet doesn't get confirmed because how do Republicans go back home to voters and say we controlled all of Washington and there was a slam dunk Supreme Court seat that would have sealed the conservative majority and totally ... and we don't have that anymore\n[noise] okay I can I can I can see that ... will will push them to decide [laughter] or knows we will be talking about half an hour in the days ahead Rosenstein what is happening with with the deputy attorney general now\nYeah he seems to have gotten out of the crosshairs of President Trump for the moment I'm President Trump saying wait until after the midterm which is what seems to have done with a lot of controversial decisions over at the Justice Department including whether he lets the top guy attorney general Jeff Sessions go\nA house Republicans as sort of picking up that mantle for the president though they want to interview Rosenstein and talk to them about whether he tried to wiretap\nThe president or get cabinet officials to impeach the president um and that the real danger for Rosenstein because House Republicans a group of them have already filed impeachments articles against him\nOr is it possible that the president could and maybe he has cooled down and ...\nThey want to interview Rosenstein and talk to them about whether he tried to wiretap the president or get cabinet official to impeach the president um and the real danger for Rosenstein because House Republicans a group of than it already filed impeachment articles against them\nOr is it possible that the president could and maybe he has cooled down and could convince House Republicans to cool their jets when it comes to Rod Rosenstein\nYou know that's a great question I watched the token poll closely between President Trump and his allies in the house and in the end his allies and our team to win out\nA there was a battle recently over whether the Justice Department should give over information about an hour and they had and Trump was sort of no I don't know I don't I don't know if we should release that\nAnd House Republicans pushed him and and Trump\nEssentially made them turn it over\nOur it did I miss that I leave anything out amber [laughter] so much has happened has happened today and I'm\nLike oh my goodness well you're going to get into the old gender debate later in the show which I'm looking for the area and in\nFact we are going to do that right now ... with the Washington Post thanks very much for being on America on the line thank you for joining me now to focus on the gender politics at the cabinet investigation has brought back into the spotlight are WNYC is tied right\nAnd idle low

Washington Republican strategist Sam Donaldson\nAnd we're taking your calls at ... for for seven four or five eight to five five\nTo ... and that's why thanks for calling in\nThanks for having me\nWhen I saw the Kavanaugh performance was really offended but not at all surprised I'm used to say that kind of behavior from people like him and uh I thought that the press with us\nThe ... in debt die thanks for calling in\nThanks for having me\nWhen I saw the Kavanaugh performance I was really offended\nBut not at all surprised or nice to see that kind of behavior from people like him and uh I thought that the president if he's giving you a recommendation when you have allegations of sexual assault you're in trouble\nBecause of the man told us does not stand for president of the United states it stands for ... of the United states\nOkay now I ... like a world where the ... let me ask you a question do you do you think that um if judge Kavanaugh were not a white male that he would be able to\nGive that forty five minute statements that in in the way that he gave it a last there's\nWhere I'm based on how complex Clarence just jumping around its dominance right\nYep yep yep yep yeah I think so because there is a pecking\nOrder and men are higher in the pecking order than women are period\nRight ... thank you very much for for calling in from vets die a Brett ... in Rogers, Arkansas thank you for calling in to America on the line\nBut thanks forever but it's been ... or ... or did you go ahead or at least for myself\nSo I have three boys and one in front of your age group and that there can ruin a criminal can root route to it but this is on the costs\n... thank you for calling in to America on the line\nI think forever but the truth or conversation we'll see what I did your nuclear or at least for myself I have three boys or is it twenty five year each group [noise] this is something that\nProbably they're communicating ... routinely that this is on the top of their mind about to fall asleep or there's a lot of drama in that age group that Eighteen and twenty five is you someone was built up could agree with him who knows who's feelings and get hurt\nWho knows what the fact that I was always ... they are constantly having to respond to accusations nothing like this but as far as sexual issues like that but just slight allies of back stabbing ... it's it's it's just to find was that age group and\nA lot of places it yes my son's feel targeted they feel like they could be justifiably accused of a lighter but\nWhoever the Iceman is it to send them um if you're a civil to others you know this is a problem that has nothing to do to build the slow longer here in Studio city courtesy of civility others longer to get that\nCan do with the ... they have ... can I ask you a question when you say you're having your position with your with your three sons they age Eighteen twenty five and they're saying that they are ... are they specifically saying that they are afraid of being accused of sexual assault or\nDo they feel targeted just for\nYou know micro aggressions or thing things like that that don't rise nearly two that kind of level\nI I'd say a little bit of both hey they feel targeted bind\nThree sons they age Eighteen twenty five and they're saying that they are ... are they specifically saying that they are afraid of being accused of sexual assault for do they feel targeted just for you know micro aggressions or things things like that that don't rise nearly two that kind of level\nI I'd say a little bit of both hey that feel targeted by do I know lots of listeners out there as it but they are all white men yes they feel targeted at the very least they feel that they're being pushed out of work that will propped up\nYou know others will choose our generation that we'll us white men were pushed up and we had a opportunities that others have though they're being pushed down and targeted articles\nAnd it's on the front of their minds out socially about how to behave but they've had offered to you know she was able to Paris where I Am not saying that they are just because of rumors start tapping into social media runs wrap it was something that can't even defend\nThe also it's Carmen more common that we want to believe that that age because people are up bread I become legislators rent I Want to\nThank you very much for calling into America on the line brand was calling in from Rogers, Arkansas Brent gave us a lot to [laughter] to think about there and that gets to the bigger question that I wanted to ... or bigger topic I wanted us to discuss in that is\nAs Brad was talking about there's a there is a swath of the American electorate that feels like Brett and Brett's sons and they're going to be going to the polls in thirty something days and the president given what he said and given Brett Kavanaugh's a performance last Thursday\nIs that really is this really a thing\nAnd I wanted us to discuss in that is\nAs bread was talking about there's there is a swath of the American electorate that feels like Brett and Brett's sons and they're going to be going to the polls and thirtysomething days and the president given what he said and given Brett Kavanaugh's a\nPerformance last Thursday is that really is\nThis really ah thing have we hit a cultural moment where where straight white aggrieved men are going to view this moment as they're rallying cry to show up at the polls\nWhether or not they show up at the polls is as one question but I mean I don't I think we shouldn't rush too quickly passed the the meat is a thing that Brett is talking about because I have heard versions of that repeatedly and reporting on the United states side he wouldn't have been talking to to Trump supporters and to\nSort of alienated white people in general and um and the problem is that there are two there there are more than one things have one thing happening at the same time one you know there are not\nAh these questions about accusations whether they'd be false or not a\nExist outside of a world we we don't have a world in which we have actually created systems for dealing with sexual harassment and so everybody all of us\nHad anxiety about it that Israel because we have done a terrible job of creating systems for dealing with sexual harassment period and if we actually had systems in place nobody would have to feel anxiety about false accusations are true accusations 'cause there'd be a system set up for dealing with it\nAnd so that's one set of conversation that we\nShouldn't be having as a society but we can't have it as a society because we have the president in the United states and one of the major parties or one of the two major parties using a megaphone to to to rile up ... this this white male ... identity politics a white male agreements that makes it\nBecause there'd be a system set up for dealing with it and so that's one set of conversation that we\nShould be having as a society but we can't have it as a society because we have the president in the United states and one of the major parties or when the two major parties using a megaphone to to to rile up ... this this white male\nGrievance this identity politics a white male agreements that makes it impossible to have a an intelligent and useful conversation about what what do Brett funds and he\nYou know and and how can ... sons thrive in and actually pro plural society\nAlex is I I I I Want you to also to get in on this but I have to go to do to Sam to get your perspective um one as a Republican but also as the white male on this panel\nWell I think this is going to be the year the wall of frankly at the ballot box and whether or not word of civil society if we feel for we wake up the day after the election ... tell us a lot\nMhm what about okay go ahead Sam\nSo but I mean I you see white suburban women as the example of left this guy drove you\nWe always see these posters all the time talking about generic ballots which for your listeners is you know would you vote for a Democrat or Republican for Congress for getting anything else just straight partisanship\nAnd you know you see these numbers now bad around with his public polls of aid per se at high levels ... single digits low level it is\nBut when you look at women of

Russia and the ... in the ... version of American democracy and I spoke with him earlier today\nGreg Miller welcome to America on the line thanks very much so the title of your book is a play on the reality television show that citizen Trump made famous but how are you using to monitor The Apprentice your new book well\nYou're right so it's it's the name of the show that propelled him to such great fame I think that it works on a couple of other levels you know obviously he came into the White House pretty unprepared for the job never held public office before I'm needed a lot of kind of um\nStaff and expertise around him to function in the job and even then it looked pretty clunky at times\nAnd then of course there's this other aspect to it ah this this ... that are characterized as his relationship to ... or seems to uh and so you know he's he's an apprentice president in some ways\nSometimes he seems to behave as if he's an apprentice to boot and that seems to be his model that is who he often actually admires and sometimes it's we emulates how does\nThat ... that admiration for the Russian President how does that go over with the national security community that you cover and have been covering for years\nThat's a really great question and I think that the reality is that a that\nThis this is a schizophrenia could minister ration you have a head of state and the president who believes one thing about Russia or who rejects most of what his advisors tell him about Russia let alone what all of U.S intelligence agencies have concluded about Russia [noise]\nUh but you have this whole separate um entity I mean he would call it the deep state but it's not that deep\nThis this is a schizophrenia could minister ration you have a head of state the president who

whole separate um entity I mean he would call it the deep state but it's not that deep I mean I think these are his many of them are his advisors who work closely with him in the White House\nThey see a completely differently and they do their best to try to minimize the harm or to try to keep the Russia policy uh on makeup resemble what it has been a through our recent history\nCannot withstand a president who is bucking um decades' worth of practice can't can that ah other part of American government with Stan I'm President Trump\nThat's you know that is the big test a lot of the institutions of government are undergoing a an enormous stress test right now I'm In the White House with this president and I think it's an unanswered question so far I think that um\nWe don't really it's hard to know what the what the damage to these institutions might be beyond Trump's term however long that ends up being\nI think that the Justice Department and the FBI or under particular stress and you could point to a areas where they are holding it together and doing well right the Mueller investigation has racked up all of these indictments said had made a has made it an incredibly compelling

look like it is politically motivated um any surface some real stuff right there have been problems that he has that have been exposed to all of this drama\nUm such as well the the the ... the a tax between these FBI agents and so forth\nThey kind of I'm In ... the the the drama around McCabe a former FBI deputy director I'm Around the uh Rosenstein and his you know impulse is to\nTo put a wear a wire and meetings with the president you know this is weird stuff\nYou'd go it goes hand in hand with the Trump president do\nYou do you believe that um deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in the story that um that's been out there the pushback has banned Rosenstein was joking but the reporting is he wasn't joking where do you where do you land on that\nMy sense and I write about this in the book I don't write about um his proposal to wear a wire but what I Do write about in the book is how um\nHow disturbed she seemed about I'm sort of emotionally\nAfter what happened in the ... in his hand in it how he was used to write the White House makes this decision Trump makes this decision to fire James Comey\nBut then pins that decision on Rod Rosenstein is deputy attorney general he writes this memo that the White House points too that says this is why we're taking the step Rod Rosenstein says he's a terrible FBI Director roast\nI'm sort of emotionally after what happened in the

just a gas he sees his reputation he built up\nOver decades in the department just going up in flames and his reaction or in this in this moment um he'd behaving a bitter radically at times he's sending messages to colleagues that make them concerned about\nHis emotional uh wellbeing\nAnd so I I kinda think that he I I tend to believe that this did happen that he does propose it in a serious way he sees this as a crisis right um uh and he uh he um\nHe was deeply troubled about where they were this is all heading and that's why in the book and I was right about\nThis sets in motion his decision to secretly hiding from the White House hiding it from the attorney general sessions his decision to bring Bob Mueller and and give him the job of special counsel the crisis\nI'm that Rod Rosenstein finds himself in the nation finds itself in now you start off the book and your prologue um he goes back to August twenty sixteen and it involves then CIA director John Brennan\nAnd a a place within the CIA called Russia house what is Russia house and what did he discovered there that was so significant that he called up then chief of staff Denis McDonough and said I Need to get in
