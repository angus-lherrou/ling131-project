rates\nThat does not blamed me to the fact that this congressional district has ... per capita incomes in the country that does not blind me to the fact that our veterans do not receive adequate health care of the border\nIs riddled with drugs and human trafficking nor does it by me to the fact that in the sixteen years the incumbent has no solutions to improve these conditions and raise the quality of life of its constituents\nUnlike my opponent I have no obligations to special interest groups\nI Would never call for a boycott of the state I'm committed to work towards measurable change

includes a majority of our states border with Mexico so this first round we'll focus on issues related to border security and immigration the first question goes to Mr ... from a VPN Nancy monthly\nMr getting ... there are many people across this country who feels that undocumented immigrants uh especially from Mexico and Central America are real drain on our community resources what's your take on that and can you give me some examples but I\nThink what has to put that question in in in the context of what what has occurred for the last Eighteen months it even prior to that we have heard a a a very divisive or\nAttack on anything immigrants in this country by the president and others we've had an enforcement only policy or by the president and others and the department of homeland security what we have the border\nIs very much an issue of economic\nUh economic failure on the part of other parts of ... of Latin America but more importantly what we have at the border is an opportunity and what we're concentrating right now is an enforcement and division it's no secret that everybody running for office goes and takes a picture in November lives in front\nOf of the wall and says this is what I Want to do\nThe issue is much more complex it ... it requires comprehensive approaches of solutions time we talked about solutions and not just getting ready to batter or dead\nIs an opportunity and what we're concentrating right now is on enforcement and division it's no secret that everybody running for office goes and takes a picture and all that lives in front of of the wall and says this is what I Want to do\nThe issue is much more complex it ... it requires comprehensive approaches of solutions time we talked about solutions and not just continuing to batter a dead horse about an issue that\nIs political rhetoric and really know solutions and be offered by the majority in Congress\nMr piercing you have thirty seconds for a response\nWell obviously the the borders are complex situation it's going to take an enforcement of the regulations that we now have but it also involves comprehensive immigration reform and I'm for providing away for for the people to be treated with dignity\nAnd where they can earn a path to citizenship and I'll discuss more of that later\nThank you the next question is from Joe Ferguson in the air is on Daily Star for Mr Peterson\nPearson the ... reports thousands even hundreds of migrants being arrested in ... Arizona that served in the past few months\nWhat's the federal ... meant mitigation patterns would you repeat that question of course the bar patrol reports groups of thousands even hundreds of migrants are being arrested in Arizona's desert in the past few months what's a federal solution to these mass migration patterns\nThe solutions to these mass immigration patterns is is threefold one\nWe have to provide border security we have to provide comprehensive immigration reform we have to provide a path for citizenship that includes dignity and we're promoting our red white and blue ... plan the red plan would be where people can\nUm announced that they are here and then there's going to be a moratorium on the\nMass immigration pattern says is threefold one\nWe have to provide

be where people can\nUm announced that they are here and then there's going to be a moratorium on the um on on deportations\nThe white plan is where Congress will agree and pass and find on impervious wall on the ... and us border and three when the wall or in the when the barrier not the wall but when the barriers complete then the path to citizenship can be established so that everybody that is in our community can uh live here with dignity\nHighly yes thirty second first on\nThe issue is is is is a is an issue that cannot be easily resolved with a ball it cannot be easily resolved and enforcement only attitude decision is it is an issue that deals with poverty\nIt deals with persecution it deals with political upheaval and Central America in particular and it deals with with with the very fundamental need a people we saw the moms and and the kids to flee situation\nI and to look for an opportunity and the United states is viewed by many in the world is that opportunity so the fundamental issue is building capacity within within the ... the countries that are sending people and people are fleeing bill capacity civil society rule of law long term\nAre doing that I think does more to alleviate the pressure on the border in terms of people wanting to come here for all those reasons that I mentioned\nNot doing anything and waiting for a wall is not going to solve the problem\nI think you can sort of how they want to remind you want to stick to our time limits here and our question for Mr holidays\nThat are sending people and people are fleeing bill capacity civil society rule of law long term are doing that I think does more to alleviate the pressure on the border in terms of people wanting to come here for all those reasons that I mentioned not doing anything and waiting for a wall is not going to solve the problem\nThank you Mr how they want to remind you want to stick to our time limits here and our question for Mr holiday this one comes from and John ... of our NPR sister station Phoenix cage eighty Z\nOur ports of entry at the border or overwhelm due to severe manpower issues and hiring is at a standstill and that's in spite of local government and business efforts to speed up border crossings\nSo what's the last legislation that you put forward or help to support to staff our ports of entry\nYeah it was a it was a it was a piece of legislation that we've introduced every year\nUh that deals with a five billion dollar is a a funding for all the ports of entry to increase personnel modernize the facilities\nAnd by doing that to increase security you include you expedite the flow of goods and services you make visitation a possibility with now and the waiting in lines began to it and\nThat ... initiative was important we were able to secure with the help of the late Senator McCain\nAnd opportunity ... are not part of the equation this because this is political fodder in DC they can't take a picture to leave and never stop to understand both the history and the importance of this border region a\nThank you Mr ... we have a follow up question now this one comes from the ... the ... going to get which candidate you'd like to answer first as a mind you're both candidates will have forty five seconds to answer this question\nA mystery ... you know all of your legislation that you have supported and tried to put forth on the border are what are you most proud of and what what has been your biggest accomplishment\nI thought I thought the the effort the legislative efforts or haven't been accepted as legislative effort and when I began this process very few supportive at that moment of changed considerably in the last four years\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... surveys which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part time controller dot com\nThat's legislative effort and when I began this process very few supportive at that moment of his changed considerably in the last four years and we have some opportunities\nThe successes are convincing the previous administration about the need for stimulus packages in ... San Luis so that we can start to build up that infrastructure\nThe quarter going from the valley is a Tucson or that now receive twenty five billion dollars very proud of that\nSo it has been a consequence of having someone in the White House it was appreciative of that and supported the local communities are legislatively it's got to be comprehensive reform and uh so far this has been an appetite by these majorities in Congress Steven tackled that I\nNeed to stop you there Mr Peterson yeah forty five seconds to respond\nAs far as ah the question that Mr Modi switches huh yes certainly well one thing that um the incumbent has failed to tell us is that he had very little to do with the that money going to the border communities\nThe other legislators worked very hard at that and and he's all happy to be in on the on the goodies on that\nSo it's an important area takes leadership and it takes someone as he mentioned that ... that can get the agreement of the others in Congress and I believe he's not in a position because of his views where he's going to be able to accomplish that and that's why we need change\nIncludes our segment on border related questions we now turn our attention to issues related to the environment the first question\nSo it's an important area takes leadership and it takes someone as he mentioned that that can get the agreement of the others in Congress and I believe he's not in a position because of his views where he's going to be able to accomplish that and that's why we need change\nThat includes our segment on board or related questions we now turn our attention to issues related to the environment the first question is from a VPN Nancy Montoya the Centers for Mr ... about reminder one minute response please\n[noise] my most have allowed ... and I know both of you are bilingual so you know that means water\nOr Mr good at ... um about the Colorado River watershed a situation what should be the federal government's role in having some kind of a drought contingency plan what should the federal government's role being that\nI think it's a federal government's role was we've got to the Colorado River has to be proactive\nAnd right now just got a city back under this administration and see what the state of Arizona and their own stumbling around them what to do with a water management plan for the state given droughts\nGiven scarcity given the finite reality of that resource or the federal government to step in and provide guidance Colorado's a resource for Seventeen million people countless businesses\nFrom here to Southern California and beyond and so it is a resource it needs to be preserved we cannot allow uranium mining around the Grand Canyon to preserve that water source and we cannot let this assistance to continue to happen without having contingency plans and this acquires choices\nAnd this requires a user's\nA to understand that sometimes the highest users and consumers of water in the state or have to take a ... step toward the reality that we have now that we have to conserve this water and manage it much better than we're doing now\nThat water source and we cannot let this assistance to continue to happen without having contingency plans and this is the quietest choices\nAnd this requires a user's a to understand that sometimes the highest users and consumers of water in the state or have to take a step toward the reality that we have now that we have to conserve this letter and manage it much better than we're doing now\nThank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds for a response\nWill do the water issue is a state issue that needs to be resolved between the participating states in the central Arizona project I Would prefer that the federal government not not be involved\nAnd as far as the local sources of water currently we are the city of Tucson is an CAP water and my biggest concern is the contamination level\nSo I think one of the biggest things we can do is forward or legislation that would create a national standard for for the water quality and this is one thing that is missing in and we need scientific help on this\nAnd he now question from ... from the Arizona Daily Star this one is for Mr Peterson\nPearson how ... works in Congress to prioritize what is often seen as western issues such as federal versus private land use\n\nPrivate land use 'em should first be taken up by the state one of the things that I Would be in favor of is that the federal lands more those federal lands be turned over to the state so that this could increase the educational trust fund any increase revenues from the state trust funds\nAnd with so much of the federal lands are in the state being controlled by federal and a\nTribal entities that doesn't leave us much for the state trust lands and I think we should also swap out land that that should be in the state trust land some of our state trust land isn't that humid proving ground so we should change a swap land out so\nPolice revenues from the state trust funds\nAnd with so much of the federal lands are in the state being controlled by federal and a\nTribal entities that doesn't leave us much for the state trust lands and I think we should also swap out land that that should be in the state trust land some of our state trust land isn't that humid proving ground so we should\nChange a swap land out so that that land that we can't use right now that some of the human proving grounds be part of the state trust land so creative things like that should be done that would increase the revenue to find our schools\nAre highly you have thirty seconds first for\nThe public lands in Arizona and along the southwest are essential\nAnd a oversight by the federal government is essential\nRight now this administration has made the public lands uh uh one dimensional resource extraction oil gas mining period\nAnd that's a are public lands and our waterways as well like the Colorado or a run a national resource and I think that the prospect of the federal government could bring to this is that uh we need to protect those that need to be conserved ... what do they need to conserve and more importantly as we look at climate change\nAnd that reality and as we looked at what's going on with water and that reality those public lands become invaluable in terms of how they fit into that picture\nAnd remind you will stick to the time limits any over ... will result in a penalty later that sinister about how this one is from John ... from our NPR sister station in Phoenix ...\nHow do you two questions first or do you favor Arizona implementing strict to water conservation throughout the state and secondly in a follow up how would you work with the Arizona Governor to balance out our water needs with our gross\nYeah the ... the the domestic\nIs trying to kill not easy from our NPR sister station in Phoenix ... that you\nHave to have two questions first or do you favor Arizona implementing stricter water conservation throughout the state and secular and a follow up how would you work with the Arizona Governor to balance out our water needs with our gross\nYeah the ... the domestic use the household use of water are in this state has increase that potentially as we have grown in population\nAnd and that has to be accommodated and and the issue of the use of water by mining companies has to be accommodated this has to be looked at in terms of how much they use\nHow much certain ... certain crops used in terms of how the high use of water to they have that has to be a factor did and and and the governor and\nOther elected officials must begin to look at those options are those are choices that they're facing a I think to ignore the fact that this finite resources going down is a mistake another thing I Would do is this a shared water a permit that is given to ah to developers like along the ... that the court just would rule for\nAssured water seems to be has no criteria to it or I should water should really mean that scientifically\nAssured water and I think many times they're handed out as part of a development agreement when in reality there and our water we're losing thank you Mr Pearce and you have thirty seconds for response\nWe're going to be fighting all over the world for water and it and in Arizona we really need to address that so one of my biggest concerns is local\nAnd that local concerns involves our water table which are at the moment has too many contaminates contaminants and this problem needs to be addressed because if there is a drought situation Tucson is going to be one of the first ones to be suffering from this\nAnd obviously we need the cooperation of the central Arizona\nBe fighting all over the world for water and it and in Arizona we really need to address that so one of my biggest concerns is local\nAnd that local concerns involves our water table which are at the moment has too many contaminates contaminants and this problem needs to be addressed because if there is a drought situation Tucson is going to be one of the first ones to be suffering from this\nAnd obviously we need the cooperation of the central Arizona project to the extent that we can I I don't want the federal government are involved only as a last resort\nAnd keep your next question comes from Athens I had this one is for Mr Peterson Mr Pearce and um should environmental policies are especially things like carbon emission standards should that be a federal and state or local issues plays in and tell me why\nWell obviously a climate change is is in ... is a very critical issue we have to be leaders in\nProtecting the environment our country should be leading in innovation in ways to protect the environment and clean the environment and uh as far as the carbon tax is concerned that has to be part of the total package which addresses climate change\nTaking money I'm from different areas for this um has to be considered very carefully because we we have to\nConsider the effects on our economy so we have to address this in in a way that's a fiscally responsible\nAnd it's you know how the thirty seconds for a response\nThe United states has become engaged in the issue of climate change is a worldwide issue at affects this country where what the the greatest producer of or the greenhouse effect in the in the world and we need to be involved that we should pull out of the Paris accord\nWe have to address this in in a way that's a fiscally responsible\nMr ... thirty seconds for a response\nWe the United states has become re engaged in the issue of climate change is a worldwide issue\nTransportation basic services\nBroadband even get into those communities and so if you're going to deal with rural America or it's not just a question of waiting for Santa Claus I think there has to be initiatives on the part of the federal government to provide\nThank you Mr how old are you there and we did a follow up question also related to the environment is one comes from or district or issues related congressional districts three it's some kind\nBroadband even get into those communities and so if you're going to deal with rural America or it's not just a question of waiting for Santa Claus I think there has to be initiatives on the part of the federal government to provide\nThank you Mr how old are you there and we did a follow up question also related to the environment is one comes from or district or issues related to a congressional districts three is on comes from Nancy ... I'm from Mr\nPearce and it's been a one of the political realities as that or an elected official at the federal level is only as powerful as the committees you get placed on a if he were elected what specific committees would you see to be appointed to in order to help this district\nWell first of all in helping this district I can help the district\nMost from\nWorking from the local level I Will work hard to be on the other committees in Congress I understand that you have to buy yourself a position on a lot of those committees but I Will work locally\nFairly by yourself\nWell I understood that some of the positions you have to contribute money to your uh to the leadership to get a position\nSo I'm going to start locally and improve the economy and the living conditions in the district as best I can and I'm going to do the best I can to improve and then gain access to committees um in in ... in Congress what committees\nWell the education committee is an important one we need to get more funding uh for here and also the education of the immigration to protect the border and and to improve the border security and to work on immigration reform\nYou Mr gr hardly yeah forty five seconds sort of re elected a repeat of the committee say have and that if I'm fortunate enough to be in the majority I Will be chairman of the national Resources Committee and the second most senior\nWe need to get more funding uh for here and also the education of the immigration to protect the border and and to improve the border security and to work on immigration reform\nThank you Mr gr hardly yeah forty five seconds\nSort of re elected on ... the committee say have\nAnd that if I'm fortunate enough to be in the majority I Will be chairman of the national Resources Committee\nAnd the second most senior member of the education and workforce committee so that some of the things and legislation concepts\nThat President majorities for the last eight years and not allowed even to to be hurt or a committee hearings will now have an opportunity to be debated and go through regular order if I have that opportunity and I'm reelected ... that's I Would stay on the committees that among\nThank you for the remainder tonight's debate or panel will be asking questions covering a variety of issues facing the district and the nation you know for ... years on Daily Star question now from Mr ...\n... I'm Glad you mentioned regular order Congress hasn't passed the full but for your budget in a very long time instead of passes a bunch of short term temporary measures notice continuing resolution\nHe's get federal agencies little room to plan to make changes but give Congress and the president a tool for negotiating policy would you advocate for or against this pattern and bought a budgeting\nAgainst I think one of the things that the house of representatives has to do as a coal equal member of Congress and up an important responsibility for the United States Congress house of representatives is to develop the budget and to develop the budget to each committee process\nTo have hearings to look at each agency and then from that budget is adopted then you go through the appropriations process of how you are going to spend that money are we haven't done that just been piecemeal of that we have a good we're working under continuing resolution till December seventh right now and\nHe for the United States Congress house of representatives is to develop the budget and to develop the budget to each committee process\nTo have hearings to look at each agency and then from that budget is adopted then you go through the appropriations process of how you are going to spend that money\nAre we haven't done that just been piecemeal of that we have a good we're working under continuing resolution till December seventh right now and nobody could plan we don't have an infrastructure bill we don't have a transportation bill we don't have a farm bill\nAnd uh I think that the American people just sort of a much better they deserve some consistency and some ability to know what that decision is the impact on them for that year and following years and we're not doing that\nIt's your parents being you know have thirty seconds for response\nWell obviously we all would like a balanced budget at the federal level the problems are many in in designing a budget what needs to be done as you need to get\nAgreement among both parties that we're going to be at a certain spending level and to take into consideration unfunded liabilities those are going to be hitting us\nWe have a future liabilities in terms of health care for elderly and so it's it's a difficult situation but we need to work hard on that\nQuestion now from kj ... this question is for Mr Peterson\nOur border towns and cities three they're hurting economically um prominent business citizens shuttered main streets are drying up and they'll guy listen Douglas in San Luis\nSo what do you propose to support these local areas as they attempt to bring some sort of economic stability or business back to those main streets\nWell that's a very important problem that we have\nEconomically um prominent businesses have shuttered main streets are drying up and they'll guy listen Douglas in San Luis\nSo what do you propose to support these local areas as they attempt to bring some sort of economic stability or business back to the main streets\nWell that's a very important\nProblem that we have all along the border and and the border cities what we need to do and what I have spent my life doing is working with small to medium sized businesses\nAnd working within the community within the community organizations the nonprofit boards that I worked on the grading the consensus on solutions to the problems so one of the things that we need to do is work with the ... public sector of the private sector and the educational institutions in the community so that we can find ways to\nSolve the problems in terms of a growing the economy and you need to create an environment that will that will provide for businesses to a girl I Will put a lot of energies into promoting business growth throughout the district and we need to create more educational opportunities\nThis involves of training our students with vocational training so they they can\nAdvance in their in their careers and and we can attract more employers that provide better salaries\nYesterday or how the thirty seconds frankly to the border build that I referenced earlier had a major component of economic development and and I think that it's a good time to talk about investment because part of this whole discussion is ah magically it'll happen known\nThere at the role the federal government has an area like the border that you pointed out those needs is to invest in Flint sent device to fix those ports of entry or to work in order to lift and diversify that economy along that border it's an investment strata\nIt's a good time to talk about investment because part of this whole discussion is ah magically it'll happen known\nThere at the role the federal government has in areas like the border that you pointed out those needs is to invest in it ... percent of ice to fix those ports of entry\nOr to work in order to lift and diversify the economy along that border it's an investment strategy and by having an investment strategy then you begin to develop the economic development activity that needs to happen on the border without\nWithout it without an investment the federal government which has occurred for the last decade\nWe continue to sit around twiddling their thumbs and hoping something will happen there has to be an initiative\nAnd now question from Arizona Public media is Nancy Montoya this question for Mr ... again and one minute response thirty second hour bottle from Mr Pearson\nMr guinea have you been arrested for a protesting a some federal policies I and you often speak harshly about the president and about the Republican Party [noise] how is that serve your district\nWell I think it it serves under the fence that you know I I said before I wasn't elected to Congress to be a potted plant I have a voice and I think that voice is representative of the majority of the district and I use that voice and and to point out\nUh what Trump is doing enough varieties of arenas is I think my responsibility to question and to be an effective opposition to some of the initiatives that the Republican majorities are doing it in Congress and the things that are not doing I think that's my responsibility as well\nBecause if if we are going to talk about change in the future then I think people need to know where you're coming from what your position is\nAll righty arenas is I think my responsibility to question and to be an effective opposition to some of the initiatives that the Republican majorities are doing it in Congress and the things that are not doing I think that's my responsibility as well\nBecause if if we are going to talk about change in the future then I think people need to know where you're coming from\nWhat's your position is and not hide from it and I I think people that know me know that that I don't have a problem telling people what my position is and I don't have a problem but posing things that I think are hurtful to the district and will aggravated situation even more worse than it is right now\nMr how the point of clarification on that do you believe that breaking the law getting arrested is the proper representation leadership to show young people in your district\nWell it it it is it's it's an issue of civil disobedience\nAnd is an issue that is protected by the first amendment I think I'm being consistent you know people can lie and throw things at me but you know I Believe in the first amendment so that right to lie is protected but uh I feel that when it comes to a situation\nTo bring issue to DACA in front of Trump Tower in New York City\nAnd to make that an issue and drawing national attention to it was inappropriate move in order to do just that\nThank you Mr Peterson yeah thirty seconds to respond\nWell to that point be an effective means getting\nYour views accepted enough so that the majority\nMoves the ball forward Mr ... but clearly has not been effective and he said sixteen years to be effective in Congress and he's ineffective in and moving the ball forward so what we need to do is change the the district needs change\nThank you Mr parents now question from Ferguson this is for Mr Peterson\nViews accepted enough so that the majority moves the ball forward Mr drawl but clearly has not been effective and he said sixteen years to be effective in Congress
