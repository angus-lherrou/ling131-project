Peterson those burgers Peterson arrows on his relationship with Mexico is vital how do you think President Trump is treated the U.S relationship with Mexico overall and if you'd a window seat would you address and directly on some of those anti Mexico rhetoric\nKnow it's interesting I've even as the chamber president had the opportunity to address the Trump Administration and kid visors on the relationship with Mexico I've not always agreed with the direction or the comments that he's made but I made sure to explain to him\nTo Mexico is vital how do you think President Trump is treated the U.S relationship with Mexico overall and if you'd a window seat would you address them directly on some of those anti Mexico rhetoric\nYou know it's interesting I've even as the chamber president had the opportunity to address the Trump Administration and key advisors on the relationship with Mexico I've not always agreed with the direction or the comments that he's made\nBut I've made sure to explain to him the perspective that I have is the Tucson Hispanic Chamber president and how important our relationship with Mexico is their number there are number one trading partner for the state of Arizona more than a hundred and ten thousand jobs in Arizona depend on trade with Mexico\nI have close relationships and have worked with Governor do see in the Arizona Mexico commission collaboratively with our partners in Mexico and I would continue to bring that perspective to President Trump and he'd ministry shouldn't when elected to this office\nThank you and most Kirkpatrick you have thirty seconds\nIf you wish is so important that we have a good relationship with Mexico a third of our economy here in southern Arizona comes from Mexico I visited with the mayors of Douglas Sierra Vista\nOr even Republican business people said they don't want a wall to wall is not the answer or we need comprehensive immigration reform\nThat protects dreamers and DACA recipients but not a wall\nThank you very much our next question is from Joe Ferguson of the Arizona Daily Star and it is for ms Kirkpatrick\nThank you mark ... Peterson ... thirty seconds if you'd like to\nSell the role of the federal government I think is certainly in planning however some of the the very drastic conditions are facing the ... county in particular\nNeed to be a partnership between local jurisdictions and the federal government\nOne of the first things we can do as a plane to director of beer on land management that's an important function and important person that can relate to the the water situation and the crisis we're facing and coach he's county I think decisions about water need to be made locally by local jurisdictions and they need to be at the table\nThank you or next question comes from Lorraine Rivera under those for ms Marquez Peterson\nHow were you were to get Congress to prioritize what are often seen as western issues like federal versus private land use and water conservation policy\nIt gets chilly about having a seat at the table engaging in committees that reacts\nIt's about water need to be made locally by local jurisdictions and they need to be at the table\nThank you our next question comes from Lorraine Rivera under this for\n... Marquez Peterson how were you were to get Congress to prioritize what are often seen as western issues like federal versus private land use and water conservation policy\nI think it's truly about having a seat at the table engaging in committees that react to to those issues I'm I'm In particular are interested in the energy and Commerce Committee I think that's my background in that suits very well\nUm I think that would be able to provide perspective and an independent voice in Congress on some of these very important issues is key and that's how we'll get things done\nThank you for about two if you have thirty seconds\nI was on the transportation and Infrastructure Committee and plans have you on that committee again working in southern Arizona to improve infrastructure and get funding for projects\nWorking with mayor rock child with the local mayors and CD choose to improve that critical infrastructure which we need to do to improve our economy it's so important that we have good roads that we have a working water system that we have\nGood paying twenty first century jobs and quality education for our children those are all infrastructure projects\nOr no question as to ms Marquez Peterson and it comes from Steve Goldston ms workers Peterson coming back to someone was prepared for kids said what would you do when\n\nYou have to say about people from mid west out of state stepping in there\nTalked to folks throughout coaches county including the Fort Huachuca the development ah about land development companies um is so many folks had different opinions air and I'm Still truly going to stand by the fact that we need a local jurisdictions and those are going to be\n\nYou have to say about people from mid west out of state stepping in there you know\nTalked to folks throughout coaches county including the Fort what she said that the development ah that ran development companies um\nIs so many folks had different opinions air and I'm Still truly going to stand by the fact that we need a local jurisdictions and those organizations at the table it needs to be a local solutions certainly federal government can provide support in the planning\nBut I think we need to rely on ... and in ... county to solve this problem and not step in is the federal government to try and solve that for them\nThank you and most Kirkpatrick my mistake that question was actually supposed to go to use a we'll give you a full minutes and ...\nOh yeah yeah water is so critical uh and I know that a Senator Kyl and Senator McCain we're working closely with me to come up with a strategy for Arizona one of the things we really need to do is have a statewide drought plan we are in a drought\nBut we need to be all working together offered the same blueprint to preserve our water that includes things like\nLow uh uh or more efficient a water\nTanks water sinks are using gray water where we can a conservation measures perhaps collecting rainwater to a garden with oh there's so many things that we can do that really we are doing it it takes leadership\nIt takes leadership like Senator McCain was provided for do that and I plan to provide that leadership in Arizona and throughout the rest not only in congressional district\nYou thank you and our next question will be to you miss Kirkpatrick and it comes from Joe Ferguson discriminatory should Congress step into local water decisions such as the ... subdivision in service through with\nIt takes leadership like Senator McCain was provided for do that and I plan to provide that leadership in Arizona and throughout the rest not only in congressional district\nYou thank you and our next question will be to you miss Kirkpatrick and it comes from\nJoe Ferguson discriminatory should Congress step into local water decisions such as the approval but subdivision in service to several thousand homes if it threatens the federal property is like for her to go\nYou know I used to serve on the water commission and one of the real concerns I had was approval of the subdivisions what's out actually looking\nA water source for those subdivisions that would've really saved us family a lot of profit homes it has to be a joint effort between the federal government and the state government working together to make sure that we've got\nChecks and balances in place so people aren't sold land or houses that don't have adequate water I really feel for that family they invested their entire life savings into that property and now they can't sell it because they don't have water source of water source\nThank you miss Marquez Peterson you have thirty seconds if you'd like it you know in the Sierra Vista community this has been so top of mind Joe as you're aware and they'd not pull the housing permanent\nIn a long time so I think having that discussion having that the local and state weigh in on the determination if that subdivision can be approved is key I think again the federal government can provide guidelines but those decisions should be made at the local and state level\nThank you we have a follow up question uh from Ron Hansen what the Arizona Republic or let us know if you'd like to\nA remark has a Peterson or do you accept the science of climate change and if so what are you willing to do to\nBe approved is key I think again the federal government can provide guidelines but those decisions should be made at the local and state level\nThank you we have a follow up question uh from Ron Hansen what the Arizona Republic or let us know he was like a\nYes or remark has a Peterson or do you accept the science of climate change and if so what are you willing to do to act on that in the a body of knowledge from a climate scientist\nI think it's a delicate balance between a growing a company and the environmental regulations that are put in place and not having them overreach uh but I think it is a very delicate balance it must be met\nThank you and miss Kirkpatrick is you have a forty five seconds for this follow up let's go have you here from the candidates are\nI Believe the science behind climate change um the defense department believes that it's been said it's the biggest existential threat to the planet we should've done something about Twenty years ago but what you really have to do something now we have to\nLower fossil fuel emissions and two sons got great face for this because we should be using alternative energy we should be the solar capital of the world right here in Tucson Gabby Giffords was working on that\nI Want to pick up that effort because we can do it let's stop using fossil fuel let's convert to alternative energy wind solar natural gas where it makes sense\nThank you for almost half way through the evening part of that is to believe and we are changing topics we now turn our attention to questions related to border security and immigration we begin with a question from Lorraine Rivera\nBut that effort because we can do it let's stop using fossil fuel let's convert to alternative energy wind solar natural gas where it makes sense\nThank you were almost halfway through the evening part of that is to believe and we are changing topics we now turn our attention to questions related to border security and immigration we begin with a question from Lorraine Rivera for ms Marquez Peterson says\n... Peterson should DACA recipients so called dreamers be granted citizenship and if so what do you say to the thousands of immigrants who are currently waiting for their citizenship request to be processed\nI support dreamers are achieving legal status um I did not believe it should include a pathway to citizenship and that we need to focus on immigration reform\nTimmy immigration reform means something that's merit base that includes a family\nAnd uh also includes border security I Do support the wall where it makes sense surveillance technology resources increase border patrol I think all of that should be done together it is very complex issue but I Do support legal status for dreamers\nMust Kirkpatrick I support DACA recipients I support dreamers I had an immigration working group to address immigration reform and I always started mind meeting with testimony from dreamers DACA recipients three or four of them different ones each time\nTheir stories are so emotional\nAnd in so many cases tragic\nThat I thought you know if the Capitol Hill could hear these stories we'd get immigration reform done so I introduced legislation to allow dreamers to work on Capitol Hill and I want to do that again\nThank you Steve Goldstein a question for ms ... Mr ... for the Latino community does not monolithic but as a group they tend to specific\nAnd in so many cases tragic\nThat I thought you know if the Capitol Hill could hear these stories we'd get immigration reform done so I introduced legislation to allow dreamers to work on Capitol Hill and I want to do that again\nThank you Steve Goldstein a question for ms ... after Mr ... for the Latino community we do is not monolithic but as a group they tend to specifically opposed President Trump's plan for a border wall how specific would you be as far as those Latino community who see bigotry in the White House how would you try to redress up\nWell let me talk about border security up the borders only secure when the people who live there feel that it's secure and I know ranchers along the border who feel that the\nPresident's policies are are inflaming issue and you know the policy of separating children from their parents\nIs is a horrible horrible gut wrenching painful policy a black eye on our country for the rest of our history\nI have three grandchildren under the age of three and the fact that they would ever be separated against their will from their parents and put in the hands of a stranger I Can't I Can't bear to even think about that\nI don't know how these families are coping with it we got to stop that policy we've got to pass border policies that are humane and legal what this administration is doing is in humane and illegal\nThinking this Marquez Peterson you know I've spent time with sheriff panels of ... county as well as ranchers and not go along the border and I've actually learn I think and has not met let's share of panels yet\nIt was in Maine and you'll recall\nI think it was more trusted or some\nYou know I've spent time with sheriff panels of ... county as well as ranchers and not go along the border and I've actually learn I think and has not and that was sheriff panels yet but the sheriff and others talked about the fact that drug smuggling and human trafficking is real and it's occurring at our southern border at we need to protect\nThank you our next question is for ... Peterson and it comes from Lorraine Rivera [noise]\nLast year's tax cut package is expected to add more than one trillion dollars to the national debt Republicans have look to cut future dead by scaling back spending on programs like Medicare and Medicaid do you support cutbacks on those programs or are you willing to accept the higher debt\nAnd I did not support cuts in Social Security and Medicare um I Believe we've made promises to folks who paid into the system and they need to be honored um in terms of the national debt I think we need a robust economy to build ourselves out of that and the tax and JOBS Act has been very beneficial\nHi I'm Phil Latzman and thanks for listening decay Jay's easiest audio service which is supported by your part time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all of their accounting needs find out more at your part-time controller dot com\nAnd attacks and JOBS Act has been very beneficial it's led our economic prosperity that we're seeing in our region the average family and CD to receive more than two thousand dollars a year um\nGosh consumer confidence small business confidence is at the highest levels it's been in decades I think it's been very positive and we need to let the robust economy tackle some of the debt issues that we're going to be be facing\nThank you miss Kirkpatrick you have thirty seconds if you'd like\nMy opponent supports the massive tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations\nAnd Paul Ryan came to Tucson for her and he said how are we going to pay for it we're going to have to look at Social Security and Medicare believe me under his leadership she will cut Social Security and Medicare I'm endorsed by the committee to protect and preserve\nSocial Security and Medicare and that is because I fight to keep those programs they are not entitlements there are no benefits and our seniors deserve to have and\nThank you our next question is from Steve Goldstein and it is for ms Kirkpatrick Mr country I Want to return to the topic of immigration reform\nThere was on his head many leaders when it comes to that it'd be phrase comprehensive immigration reform used to get tossed around a lot not quite as much now and I'm Wondering going forward do you think of as a possibility and have a two main policy but that also includes border security is this Congress ready to do that if you're in the house you have\nI I really believe it's possible to do that ah and you know if we pass comprehensive immigration reform\nThere was on his had many leaders when it comes to that it'd be phrase comprehensive immigration reform used to get tossed around a lot not quite as much now and I'm Wondering going forward you think of as a possibility have he's humane policy but that also includes border security is this Congress ready to do that if you're the house you up\nWhen I I really believe it's possible to do that uh and you know if we pass comprehensive immigration reform we free free up the border patrol to focus on the criminal activity stop the cartels stop the human trafficking stop the drug trafficking\nBut family if you want to come here either work\nOr to make a lot a better life for their families should have a legal way to do that or it's a it's a top priority when John McCain a ushered through that legislation in two thousand sort Thirteen I thought we'd have it done by now I really did a but we're going to push for it until we get it done\nI think it was more cars Peterson you have thirty seconds\nYeah and I spoke about immigration reform previously I Do believe we need to tackle this now and regardless of party people know that the system is broken or we need an immigration reform that includes something that's merit based on that includes family\nUm and that includes border security which as I mentioned it and for me to the wall where it makes sense surveillance increase border patrol ah resources for our share of I think it is something we need attack like an now\nCrucify may you know quick follow up but do you think you can get done I understand what your views are but do think this Congress is ready to make a habit\nI've also been hearing scene generations of bills worked on by Senator McCain and Senator Flake in the past and I do think there's a will to get this done\nWould you like forty five seconds on a follower yes I Would oh one of the things I like to do is put together working groups on various issues I talk about a little bit earlier about my immigration working group I Want to do that again\nDo you think this Congress is ready to make that happen\nI've also been hearing scene generations of bills worked on by Senator McCain or Senator Flake in the past and I do think there's a will to get this done\nMuch Kirkpatrick would you like forty five seconds on the\n... yes I Would ah one of the things I like to do is put together working groups on various issues I talked about a little bit earlier about my immigration working group I Want to do that again and so it's a way to engage the community to give me good ideas on legislation that we can pass\nI really believe that people who are in the trenches know best so this is very much\nA an approach that from the bottom up rather than me and posing my ideas on the constituents here in congressional district too and I look forward to setting up the immigration working group but we'll have other working groups on the serious problems that we're facing\nThank you we know turned to Joe Ferguson with a question for ms Marquez Peterson is mark ... Peterson can you fight any significant areas where you differ from Arthur ... if possible can you name some suffered\nFrom Martha McSally um\nI have been a a an advocate for terrorists and ... their impact on our small business community and not particular clear on what her role as a matter what her position but I'll tell you it's an area which I've expressed concern to the Trump Administration um we have\nA small businesses within our chamber of commerce that have been dramatically impacted by the steel and aluminum tariffs even when there was a threat to them before they were in place\nAnd I made sure to give that perspective and have a seat at the table with the Trump Administration to explain just those dire effects on our businesses as he went through he has to go ... or so those are areas in which I have differed with the Trump Administration in particular\nThank you Mr ...\nI see three areas where my opponent off and more than the salary agree that\nAnd limit them terrorists even when there was a threat to them before they were in place and I made sure to get that perspective and have a seat at a table with the Trump Administration to explain just those dire effects on our businesses as he went through his ... and so those are areas in which I have differed with the Trump Administration in particular\nThank you Mr ...\nI see three areas where my opponent a and Martin Sally agree they both want to privatize Social Security or they do not support a woman's right to choose and they don't believe in being accessible to the public or\nYou know there's a movement to started you\nKnow Sally ... take a stand where is she we can't fear where she doesn't speak to us she doesn't do town halls my opponent has said the very same thing she has not made herself open and accessible to the community and she'll continue to do that\nThank you our next question is for ms Kirkpatrick and it comes from Ron Hansen\nWas Kirkpatrick in three terms in Washington you were the principal sponsor of rebuild the became law\nI'm One took care of two property owners who had a bad lamb survey in Nineteen sixty another involve renaming a post office in Miami Arizonans\nThen the third involved the financial break from Native American veterans seeking housing assistance what can the residents and constituents of CD to expect you to accomplish in your next term if you get one\nYou know the what they can expect to somebody who will listen to the problem and figure out a way to solve it I pass that legislation with an Arizona Republican congressman\nOr we decided who had run against me and beat me actually and two thousand ten and we decided to put our different differences aside for the good of Arizona and work together and I look forward to working with Arizona's congressional delegation Democrats and Republicans to get legislation that\nYou're out a way to solve it I pass that legislation with an Arizona Republican congressman\nOr we decided who had run against me and beat me actually and two thousand ten and we decided to put our different differences aside for the good of Arizona and work together and I look forward to working with Arizona's congressional delegation\nDemocrats and Republicans to get legislation that significant to southern Arizona passed in a bipartisan way and so we'll be listening to talk to folks who are saying you know we need this legislation to address border security we need this legislation\nTo address education I already here that a lot or we need we need to protect Social Security and Medicare and puts them on a sustainable path\nLike you'd miss Marquez Peterson\nWasn't it's I've never run for office I'm not a politician have not had the opportunity to vote I think we need a lot of action related to our veterans we have more than sixty thousand veterans that live in this district we need to focus on bills that are going to impact the quality of the service the timeliness of the services that they are provided\nA constituent services I think are key to any Congress person and I plan and commit to our veterans that I Will do all I can to ensure that we have quality constituent services for them throughout the district\nWe have about ten minutes left him questioning and actually ah for both of you I have a question A M ms Marquez Peterson you'll get to answer this first but I'll give you both one minute to answer this district to split nearly evenly a third a third a third Republicans Democrats and independents\nIf you are elected knowing how your district is split what is one issue you would reach across the oil to the other side to pass\nAnd miss Marquez Peterson you may go first and you have them and\nSo as I mentioned I've been reading our Tucson Hispanic Chamber which is nonpartisan but includes people from\nWith nearly evenly a third a third a third Republicans Democrats and independents if you are elected knowing how your district is split what is one issue you would reach across the oil to the other side to pass and the ... Peterson you may go first and you have them and\nSo as I mentioned I've been reading our Tucson Hispanic Chamber which is nonpartisan but includes people from the entire region all different parties and so on\nAn issue of top important to them is health care and the current Affordable Care act has not been affordable it's something that most of our small businesses cannot provider or afford to provide insurance and they are we're now down to one insurance company in the state servicing us I think we need a bipartisan solution for\nThe Affordable CARE Act or Obamacare I think we need to figure out something that's going to work looking for ideas\nOr an insurance across state lines association plans we need to sit together a nonpartisan agents and figure this out because we cannot do without quality health insurance\nThank you I'm as Kirkpatrick we'll give you a minute for the\nHealth insurance is very important to families here in Arizona and across the country or in repealing Obamacare is not the answer\nBut you know in Arizona we have many places where we only have one insurance carrier in the marketplace my idea is let people buy in to Medicare Medicare is a system that people like it works\nAnd this was also paid for because there would be a premium like an insurance premiums paid for the coverage\nBut it would give people a choice where they only have one other insurance company to look too but I also want to talk about education we haven't talked much about education how important it is in Arizona I'm a product of Arizona's public schools\nThere are three federal programs\nThat the funding needs to be restored head start\nLike an insurance premiums paid for the coverage but it would give people a choice where they only have one other insurance company to look too but I also want to talk about education we haven't talked much about education and how important it is in Arizona I'm a product of Arizona's public schools\nThere are three federal programs\nThat the funding needs to be restored headstart\nSecure rules schools and payment in lieu of taxes Arizona's unique in that over eighty percent of our land is public land we fund education on property tax payment in lieu of taxes is meant to make up for the lack", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "10"}
