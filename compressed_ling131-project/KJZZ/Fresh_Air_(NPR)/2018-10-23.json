in public radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday night we're here with news analysis and your calls\nWe want to hear your opinions on the issues that matter most to you know coming up we'll be joined by one of the Democrat's biggest funders Tom's dire who's best known these days where his knee to impeach organization\nIt's not winning him a lot of popularity contests within the Democratic party in fact party leaders seemed to be running the other way but let's start though with the political news of the day and for that we're joined by the Washington bureau chief for her post Amanda Terkel Amanda welcome back to America on the line\nGreat to be here so ... as we speak actually the president of the United states president Donald Trump is in Texas doing a rally for a man he used to call lion head but now she calls him this\n\nBeautiful Ted Texas Ted Amanda please explain what's happening here\nWell Ted Cruz needs to win is election against a very charismatic fat or work and Trump is still popular in Texas so he is swallowing has pride he is letting Trump campaigned for him and he is forgetting the fact\nThat Trump during the campaign uh basically accused a Cruz's father of assassinating JFK and talked about how ugly cruises wife was I mean\nIt it's a little gross that Ted Cruz is willing to just move on and overlook all of us really awful personal\nSlights and and you know that Trump bluffs it you know Trump is out there campaigning for people like Cruz who ... who didn't like him and now they desperately need him in order to win so basically a Trump is more popular than a lot of Republican lawmakers and they are embracing him\nTalked about how ugly cruises wife was I mean\nIt's a little gross that take cruises willing to just move on and overlook all those really awful personal\nSlights and and you know that Trump bluffs it you know Trump is out there campaigning for people like Cruz who ... who didn't like him and now they desperately need him in order to win so basically a Trump is more popular than a lot of Republican lawmakers and they are embracing him\nI remember him in and maybe you were also there in Cleveland in the hall when Ted Cruz spoke at the Republican convention and criticize Donald Trump from the podium and was booed off the stage high my how things have changed in the last two years\n[noise] yeah I Do remember that too I mean there was it was an intense Republican primary and I was also there and I remember that bowling and now you know beautiful tad a Trump I think his approval rating in general is up maybe\nA he is headed up for ... ah it's his approval rating four percent more favorable that unfavorable and\nYou know cruise is not a great campaign or federal rockets out they're racing record amounts of money getting people in Texas excited getting people around the country excited and in the last debate he went on the offensive against crews\nAnd Cruz is sort of doing whatever he can and we are seeing some of that is just overlooking everything he ever set about Trump and just forgetting it happened\nYou know here's the thing they don't work has raised a ton of money a more money than I think one report said that\nA President Obama raised\nA at all at one point\nDuring his presidential runs and as you said he's very charismatic there seemed to be a big wave of enthusiasm for him around the country and then a poll came out about a week ago the shows that they don't work is behind Ted Cruz has that always been the dynamic in that campaign that this really\nPresident Obama raised a shot at all at one point during his presidential runs\nAnd as you said he's very charismatic there seemed to be a big wave of enthusiasm for him around the country and then a poll came out about a week ago the shows that they don't work is behind Ted Cruz has always been the dynamic in that campaign that this really is\nA race for Ted Cruz to lose\nAbsolutely I mean there is a very good chance\nUh even though Cruz is not running the best campaign and he's not a great campaigner or that he will still when Texas is still a red state he is still a Republican and he will probably win but the fact that it's been so close and Republicans are so worried about it and watching it so closely\nJust shows a sort of the strength of Beddoes campaign like you said he's raised a record amount of money it's more money than Jeb Bush raised during his entire presidential run in twenty sixteen\nAnd he is really changing things for the way Democrats and maybe Republicans fundraiser going forward relying on small dollar donors are treating his uh supporters and funders with respect to sort of different than some of the spam that you see coming from the other party committees so his influence will be felt long after the race even if he loses\nSo amendment ... there was some action uh in court along the lines of cases involving voter suppression was there not\nRight and we saw in New Hampshire a far from Texas out judging our Hampshire ... today black to state law that would have required additional documentation from voters\nWho moved to the state within thirty days of an election and we're starting to see this pop up in a few other places Georgia most notably where voters who think that they're going to be able to vote suddenly aren't\nNot right and we saw in New Hampshire a far from Texas now a judge in New Hampshire on today today black to state law that would have required additional documentation for voters\nWho moved to the state within thirty days of an election and we're starting to see this pop up in a few other places Georgia most notably where voters who said that they're going to be able to vote suddenly aren't going to be able to if they don't fix something and might not be able to at all because\nThere are discrepancies in Georgia for example uh\nYour your registration what you fill out the form must match exactly what the state has that file and they're about all these sorts of clerical errors there might be a drop type than there might be a small\nA number issue if that doesn't match and you don't challenge it you can't vote but the problem is that somebody said that they never knew there was a problem and so they may show up on election day and they may not be able to vote and the real issue here is that it's predominantly affecting voters where minorities\nAre looks drunk from New Hampshire and voter suppression in across the world to to turkey and the latest in the investigation and the latest on the the murder of ... my colleague at the Washington Post and the opinion section\nOf the latest news is that the CIA director Gina Haspel is on her way to turkey what's the significance of the\nIt's significant because I mean she's ahead of U.S intelligence services obviously and Turkish officials so far have been a little leery about sharing what they have which includes the audio that captures the killing and so\n... Gina Haspel supposedly will be able to hear and see what the Turkish officials have which is they say clear evidence that the Saudis were involved in deliberately killing\nServices obviously and Turkish officials so far has been a little leery about sharing what they have which includes the audio that captures the killing and so\n... Gina Haspel supposedly will be able to hear and see what the Turkish officials have which is they say clear evidence that the Saudis\nWere involved in deliberately killing James ... and then the question is whether this intelligence and what the CIA director sees will be enough to convince Trump and his administration\nThat sure enough the Saudis and the crown prince were involved\nYou know the Turkish leader everyone is promising details tomorrow at least in our time should be early early tomorrow morning any idea how as to how forthcoming or the Turkish leader will be in those details\n[noise] I don't know yet but you would ... I think that\nThey are going to be increasingly forests coming I mean the the details we've learned so far are just unbelievable that they brought a guy who looked like James ... so that they could pretend he wasn't dead he could dressing as close and walk out and make it look like the journalist wasn't dead you know they brought this\nA medical expert who specialized in autopsies and then you have the Saudis out there saying that no no no this was just a fist fight that went bad ah so the details that Turkish officials have released so far I have been pretty incredible and now I think what some people are waiting for is that this initiative audio to show them talking about the killing\nAnd no one to bring it back to North America and the story that I'm sure the president has probably brought up in his rally by now and that is\nThe caravan of migrants who are making their way from Central America through Mexico trying to make their way to the the border between the United states and Mexico\nThe president is saying that this is all done\nTalking about the killing\nAnd now let's bring it back to North America and the story that I'm sure the president has probably brought up in his rally by now and that is the caravan of migrants who are making their way from Central America through Mexico trying to make their way to the ... the border between the United states and Mexico\nThe president is saying that this is all the Democrats fault I'm In fact today Sarah Huckabee Sanders the White House press secretary told reporters that President Trump was quote as absolutely she says credible evidence or middle middle Easterners\nIn the Margaret ... have we seen any evidence to back that up\nYeah there is no evidence to back that up a that's just simply an attempt to make it seem that these people are are scary that they are trying to come here to commit violent crimes if not terrorist attacks it's just honestly racist fear mongering\nAre there is absolutely no evidence of that the Trump Administration uh you know immigration is a rallying cry for many people in the Republican base and with the Republicans are struggling a couple of weeks out Fifteen days away from the election they are turning to issues like immigration\nThey're turning to issues like NFL players kneeling the sort of social issues that they think will get their base excited\nAnd one more issued to talk about in the little bit of time that we have left um special counsel Robert Mueller news has come out that he's focusing in on Roger Stone and his WikiLeaks connection what's that about\nHas ticked up to forty seven percent in the NBC News Wall Street journal poll you know talked about that is it still the calving off them we'll talk all about\nThat after we come back or the panel will be back later in the show when we return as promised Hampshire one of the Democratic party's biggest donors here to talk about the chances\nOf the blue wave and it's

to impeach and wild need to impeach has six million signatures in his report it to be the biggest voter list in politics there are plenty of democratic leaders who wish she would just stop talking about impeachment here's Nancy Pelosi\nLet's focus that on that would not be my plan\nWould not be your plans to charge them and I have enough things on my back to impeach the president never saw that\nTo impeach and wild need to impeach has six million signatures in his report it to be the biggest voter list in politics there are plenty of democratic leaders who wish he would just stop

how that's how I [noise]\nIt's just fine\nAnd let's hope that the again with the information that comes forward and went to a demonstration\nA ... temperament said as nontraditional that the Senate will do the right thing\nAnd then there's former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd if Democrats win the house do you believe that they knew for with articles of impeachment I Hope they don't\nI don't think there's a base for doing that right\nI think we should wait until the report comes out\nThere talking about Utah's dire welcome to America on the line Jonathan thank you for having me by the way I knew that [laughter]\nAnd a reminder to listeners we want to know how you feel about candidates who talked about impeaching to president either for or against call us at eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five so yeah they're talking about you [noise] they're saying that this is not a good idea we shouldn't be talking about this and yet\nThere you are there you have been for more than a year now just a little over a year we started October twenty twenty Seventeen hammering away saying the president must be impeached so reminder what what was it that\nMade you deep dip into your own pockets buy airtime to say we need to impeach the president\nWhen we look at it and to have Jonathan one is that she met the criteria to be impeached and we've got fifty four\nOver a year we started October twenty twenty Seventeen hammering away saying the president must be impeached so remind her what what was it that\nMade you deep dip into your own pockets buy airtime to say we need to impeach the president when we look at it and to have Jonathan one is as he met the criteria to be impeached\nAnd we've got fifty four constitutional scholars we have them on our website need to impeach dot com both in December of last year in June of this year and honestly it's a lay down hand I I think with vice president Biden is talking about is\nFrankly nonsense that this is a president who has over ... is the most corrupt president in American history he overtly takes payments from foreign governments on a daily basis something is absolutely prohibited by the constitution system held among all humans in ... he\nSaid publicly that the reason he fired the head of the FBI was to shut down the Russian thing so I think that there has been an attempt on people inside\nThe beltway to say two things that it's not a practical thing before the election because they're worried that it will inflame Republicans and drive them to the polls isn't that right know\nLet let's be clear here we went and looked at five thousand Republican ads\nZero of which talked about impeachment so if it's such a great issue to inflame Republicans why do is zero out of five thousand ads talk about it what we should be asking is a completely different question and I think that we see\nThe midterm elections in what we're trying to do diametrically differently from the elite democratic people inside the beltway and here's what they think they think forty five percent of Americans vote\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part-time controller dot com\nFrom the elite democratic people inside the beltway and here's what they think\nThey think forty five percent of Americans vote in a midterm election\nOne to two percent can't figure out if they like the president whether Brett Kavanaugh is not a responsible person to be a Supreme Court justice and so we should cozy up to that one to two percent we should be Republican light we should not say anything that will offend them or inflamed them\nWhat we say something completely different we're a grassroots organization we're doing the largest grassroots\n... youth organizing Eighteen to thirty five which to me as you've in the history of America this year we say forty five percent of Americans vote which is the past history in midterms that means fifty five percent don't vote\nSo rather than going to get the one to two percent in the middle and trying to make sure we don't offend them how about if we tell the truth\nHow about if we stick up for the American people how about if we do the right thing and get the fifty five percent who don't think it's worth it to show up just show up ...\n... I mean I I hear you when you talk about you know Democratic Party elites in Washington who are against this and they don't want to do because they're closing up but there are non Washington elites who don't like the idea of talking about impeaching the president will actually if you go to the videotape\nJonathan and go to polls you will see that Seventy eight percent of Democrats want this president impeached and removed from office that the other twenty two percent about half of them don't and\nThey don't want to do because they're cozying up but there are none Washington elites who don't like the idea of talking about impeaching the president that well to me\nActually if you go to the videotape Jonathan and go to polls\nYou will see that Seventy eight percent of Democrats want this president impeached and removed from office that the other twenty two percent about half of them don't and half of them don't know so actually when you talk about Democrats and you're talking about\nNormal citizens who are registered as Democrats they overwhelmingly agree with us\nThat in fact more Americans think he should be impeached and removed from office then don't so actually when we're talking about Democrats it's overwhelmingly that the people around the country agree with us actually\nOkay so I'm at the beginning of the show and before the segment I ask people to call in whether they are for or against an effort to impeach the president I asked people to call\nA a poor for seven four or five eight to five five TI in St Louis called in here thank you for calling into America on the line You're welcome so would you like to see President Trump impeached for not impeached\nNot in pinch ... anything that your gift to share this incorrect but because of what would replace him I Do not want to see\nA president tense I Do not want to see evangelical\nSurreal law\nBecome to all of the land what I Want is for twenty twenty to show that the majority of the American people do not want that kind of leadership anymore [noise]\n[noise] I Do not want to see evangelical surreal law they come to all of the land\nWhat I Want is for twenty twenty to show that the majority of the American people do not want that kind of leadership anymore [noise]\nGreat companies me being not impeached already\nBeaten at the ballot box T I thank you very much for calling in from St Louis me dear raises a very good point if you impeach President Trump and his and succeed in getting to a super majority of votes in the Senate to convict and remove President Trump brought from office\nYou get that our president hands there are a lot of Democrats who are afraid of that\nWhat do you say to them who have that will let me say\nGee is bringing up a very important point that we've heard in every single one of the thirty seven town halls that we've done around the United states to discuss this issue everybody including me\nWho is on the Democratic side fines Mr Pence's attitudes and policy stances at odds with ours and some of them are really upsetting and Republican\nSo I completely agree but when we look at either the impeachment of the president or the twenty eighth team mid term election mid term elections we have to realize that we are not going to solve every problem at once\nThe first thing that we need to do in two weeks is to take a gigantic step forward in terms of doing exactly what she is talking about we just to get the poll the only poll that counts from the American be marches the midterm vote saying that in fact in this basic referendum

the question well we have a lot of talk about impeachment for the last one\nOn the line our news and call in show about the midterm elections back with us now is our panel Christina Greer political science professor at Fordham University Republican strategist Doug Hi from Washington and also in Washington democratic strategist Maria car doughnut will be taking your calls also in this segment specifically\nHere's the question well\nWe have a lot of talk about impeachment for the last what were the last twenty minutes I don't want to ask about that question anymore let's whatever is on your mind that is not impeachment related give us a call eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five what I Do want to uh talk about is to actually go back\nA ... you know I Want to get your um\nYour thoughts on the immigration discussion that we were having at the beginning of the show to Doug Doug gave his thoughts Maria gave her thoughts but you are listening and a shaking your head and not and so I Want to know what you were thinking or what you think about all\nThis I mean I I Do think that this is part of Trump's greatest hits you know when he has not produced the wall which is the main thing that his supporters in his base want but he can sort of whip out the racist rhetoric whenever necessary and I do think that he will use these visuals to his advantage\nSo many of his supporters have forgotten that they to our children and grandchildren of immigrants they may not necessarily being from\nLatin America they may be from Europe but they've forgotten that they came to this country oftentimes not with much in oftentimes with the country that didn't necessarily want them even though they were from Europe I'm thinking of people who were coming from\nItaly and Ireland and Ryan ... and all these other places we're now in Germany and Poland all of a sudden now it's time to shut the borders and\nI Do think that Trump will use this visual because unfortunately so many of his supporters don't see families they don't see children we've seen his supporters\nOftentimes not with much in oftentimes with the country that didn't necessarily want them even though they were from Europe and to give people who were coming from\nItaly and Ireland and rain aries and all these other places we're now in Germany and Poland all of a sudden now it's time to shut the borders and I do think that Trump will use this visual because unfortunately so many of his supporters\nDon't see families they don't see children we've seen his supporters say you know these women don't want their children taken away from them and they shouldn't be coming to the border with their not understanding of the things\nThat America does to other nations that make it such that people need and want to leave\nRight there's so many economic things that this country does to others um either starving them or providing them with you know propping up dictators are putting in you know sort of military regimes and the people have to leave their nation\nOr has been reported MS Thirteen at the president goes on about is actually a California export yet when the folks were deported we know and resident\nDoesn't like nuance and so the fact that he will just throw in oh yeah and I think I see some Middle Eastern middle Easterners we also know that you know Fox News and in his talk radio Sarah gets will pick that up and carried as truth\nAnd unfortunately his supporters they don't need to look for facts they just want to know that whatever it is that they had in this country quote unquote being taken away from them\nTiming of all of this is also very curious how all of a sudden not caring about thousands of people making they're making their way north if anybody wants to to to touch on that please jumped in but\nHaving said all that and this is something that I wanted to get to in the in the first segment of the the show and we couldn't get there's going to get there now\nPresident Trump's job approval rating after everything we obscene and been through has ticked up Doug ... forty seven percent in the latest NBC News Wall Street\nIn their way north if anybody wants to touch on that please jumped in but having said all of that and this is something that I wanted to get to in the in the first segment of the the show and we couldn't get there so when you get there now\nPresident Trump's job approval rating after everything we have seen and then through has ticked up Doug\n... forty seven percent in the latest NBC News Wall Street journal poll ... what is going on here why is it the cabinet bumps still or is it something else for both well I think I think it is important to\nKavanaugh bumped that really brought a lot of Republicans home um and some of that as natural as you get to the waning days of of Ryan cycle anyways\nUm is also a robust economy that are basically every week we hear a more good news about and that's something that Trump can can ... and and run on frankly I Wish you'd do more of that um and I I'll tell you Jonathan I saw that um salt is pretty close up in um Nashville where I was about a month ago and\nUm and how it impacts the Senate races people were\nUh that I talked to were very torn I'm even Blackburn supporters like British and thought brightest and was going was ultimately going the way to even know where they weren't voting for him and most voters think the person that they're voting for is going to win\n'em and Bredesen was was really hurt by the fact that for a long time he wouldn't take a position on um the Kavanaugh nomination even though that's something he would vote on um as a senator and ultimately I'm at the very end so that he supported them so he lost a lot of credibility in the state\nUm and that's part of the Kavanaugh bumped that has has affected Trump and and certainly a lot of Republican candidates as well one thing I'll say is a point of comparison a when I was at the Republican National committee in two thousand ten\nOr or magic number for Iraq Obama was I'm forty six we felt if he was below that on election day uh that that we'd win\nAt the very end so that he supported them so he lost a lot of credibility in the state\nUm and that's part of the cabinet bumped it has has affected trumping and certainly a lot of Republican candidates as well one thing I'll say is a point of comparison a when I was at the Republican National committee in two thousand ten\nOr or magic number for Iraq Obama was I'm forty six we felt if he was below that on election day\nUh that that we'd win back the house and you know we're obviously not election day yet but I don't think anybody would think that ... or you know a year ago that Donald Trump would be one point two points higher than ... Bible was given that the districts\nToday are um more homogeneous or more of favoring incumbents then then that was the case in two thousand ten uh this is good news for Republicans in for the first time maybe they don't have windows their backs but they don't feel they're running head first into a a very scary when ... I'm Maria de ...\nAgree that Democrats should be concerned and I have always been one to\nWarn against talk of a blue wave because we have always known that Trump is completely unpredictable we don't know what his effect on elections are we all thought twenty six he was going to go one way and it didn't\nUm I I I think that it will still be a good day for Democrats are there are a lot of things that are going on in the districts\nThat are heavily favor Democrats the candidates that we haven't been able to\nRecruit have been phenomenal\nThey have been running on health care they have been running on an economy that has only worked for the point zero one percent they had been running on the tax scam that Republicans have passed that has not help the middle class or working class voters well actually we are they they haven't been\nRunning on the on the tax cuts and that reminds me of the nation\nAble to recruit has been phenomenal they have been running on health care they had been running on an economy that has only worked for the point zero one percent they had been running on the tax scam that Republicans have passed that has not help the middle class or working class voters\nWell actually we are they they hadn't been running on the on the tax cuts and that reminds me to let her know Democrats are that are okay Republicans are not\nOnly because we haven't gotten anything nor will we hate ... exactly\nSo uh uh sorry to cut you off but no I ... on Doug on on the tax cuts that was this huge accomplishment or that the Republicans and the president got through there is that like ... on the rose garden of the White House and yet they're crickets\nOn the campaign trail when it comes to this why aren't Republicans running up to a midterm election championing the number one thing that they've been talking about for decades\nWell I think to some extent they are they're talking about the economy and ultimately the Republican argument is and you can agree with it or disagree with it um is it the bill would have a um\nA a great effect on the economy and so if we have an economy that's that's blooming Republicans are talking about that they're talking about that in their districts are talking about in the states they may not be saying here's my thirty second ad\nOn the tax cut bill but they are talking about the economy there's there's no doubt about that and that's one of the things\nThat is really interesting Republicans I'm In these in these states as as they look at what\nUm you know I I Would agree with Maria was always premature to talk about um a blue wave especially since we've been talking about one for all year now um but but Republicans are busting you know some of some of the things that have been coming against them because they're such a great economy it's again one of these things that allows Donald Trump to be ...\nThings that is really what you're seeing Republicans\nIn these in these states as as they look at what um you know I Would agree with Maria was always premature to talk about\nUm a blue wave especially since we've been talking about one for all year and then um\nUm but but Republicans are busting your some of some of the things that have been coming against them because there's such a great economy it's again one of these things that allows Donald Trump to be forty seven percent which like Donald Trump ... you know or if you don't like Donald Trump you never thought that he would be forty seven percent right out\nWe're not we're not at the end game yet with the elections but that's that's a bomb reaction to the economy\nMaria I know I I cut you up a jump back in here on this notion that are Republicans aren't even running on one of their signature issue specifically tax cuts as opposed to the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "23"}
