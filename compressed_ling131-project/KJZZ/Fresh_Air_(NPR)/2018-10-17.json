Associated Press national politics reporter Hi Lisa thanks for coming\nOn welcome to America on the line Ryan thanks for having me so\nThis just broke a couple of hours ago and it was from an ape the interviewer right how the president is comparing Saudi Arabia to Brett Kavanaugh\nTry our White House reporters sit down with the fact that in just a little while ago and my stories coming out this evening from that interview pointed vanish it's posted online now circulating ... and ...\nThanks for having me so this just broke a couple of hours ago and it was from an interview the president is compelling Saudi Arabia to ...\nThat's right our White House reporters did sit down with the president just a little while ago and we have a number of stories coming out this evening from that interview one of them is is posted on line now and circulating\nAnd he said you know the president has really been I'm leaning into this idea of\nGiving and Saudi Arabia some um distance from this a case of the missing journalist and he told the reporters there and the interview\nThat he said quote you know I think we have to find out what happened first and here we go again with you know you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that he said we just went through that with justice cabin on he was innocent and all the way\nSo he's really comparing Saudi Arabia\nAnd whether or not the I'm a ground presence and the government there is Saudi Arabia was at all\nI'm involved in the disappearance of Jamal ... the the Saudi Arabia and journalists to have gone into the consulate there and just and ball and never return dad and he um the president is is really a sort of I'm questioning\nWhether or not the government was even involved in we of course have multiple reports\nUh now you know indicating that they're there may have been a involvement there and it is something that is of course a massive investigation right now in Turkey has they uncover what happened two weeks ago when that journalists went into the consulate on some routine paperwork and and never return\nTell us a little bit of the woods men should have been opening that investigation today because what's coming off one could argue certainly his supporters argue that there was some evidence but it was far from\nThat is of course a massive investigation right now in Turkey has they uncover what happened two weeks ago when that journalists went into the consulate on some routine paperwork and and never return\nTo tell us a little bit of the woods men should have been opening that investigation today because with Kevin uh one could argue certainly his supporters argue that there was some evidence but it was far from conclusive regarding Dr ... Ford how's the evidence been shaping up\nEspecially today for people who may not have been following the news during business hours regarding the disappearance of Washington Post columnist ...\nYeah I mean these are just really two very different cases and to sort of conflate them as the president has just it's just this is just a different\nLine of a sort of thinking than than the way a lot of people are thinking of the situation of course the situation with the judge happened you know allegedly thirty five years ago and this situation here with the Saudi ... a writer it unfolding before our very eyes so I'm the a P has a report out of stumble tonight that says\nThat you know the police are searching the Saudi a consulate there and I'm I'm believe they have found um you know some evidence that he was in fact killed there and they're continuing the investigation and so you know there is um a lot of pressure right now on Saudi Arabia\nTo explain what happened you know ... you know it's a government building it's where you go to ... do you know official business and to have a citizen\nOr someone who is of the country going to you know their home state building there in a foreign country and have\nThem disappeared is you know very unusual and so you know why was the country um you know or have unable to um protect a you know the ...\nBut you know it's a government building it's where you go to do you know official this send to have a ... than someone who is of the country go into you know their home state building there in a foreign country and have\nThem just appeared it's you know very unusual and so you know why was the country um I you know perhaps on able to um protect a you know the journalist in that country\nIt just raises enormous amounts of questions and of course you have the Republican senators here in Congress which is you know where I'm at covering Capitol Hill I'm a\nVoting offices let me let me jump in on that because we have a clip of just what you are starting to refer to and here's one place where the comparison between tub and on and the Saudis\nCertainly breaks down Kavanaugh had Senator Lindsey Graham fiercely in his corner on this question of guilty until proven innocent he was Lindsey Graham today on Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman who Graham refers to hear as NBS\nThere's a difference between the country and an individual thing NBS figure is to me toxic he can never be a world leader on the world and what does the president do thank us up to the ... but what I Would do I know what I'm going to do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia\nSo why is Trump being in in defense of the Saudis when even his own party in Congress has not\nYet you know um I I Can't answer that fully you know I think the country a United States and Saudi Arabia have long and deep ties of course Saudi Arabia was the\nFirst stop foreign visit that President Trump made in twenty Seventeen after he took office\nSo um and there's been a relationship there for a very long time between these countries in the relationship or have any turbulence and the relationship obviously um it's difficult but that's exactly what you're seeing and this division as you mentioned\nSaudi Arabia have long and deep ties of course Saudi Arabia was the first uh foreign visit that President Trump made and twenty Seventeen after he took office\nSo um and there's been a relationship there for a very long time between these countries in the relationship or have any turbulence in the relationship obviously I'm as difficult but that's exactly what you're seeing and this division\nAs you mentioned between um\nThe senators I'm Lindsey Graham of course being the most outspoken but you know a number of senators I came out last week and signed on to a letter I'm sort of starting the clock on these sanctions that um could could happen ... could befall on on Saudi Arabia [noise]\nI'm In a hundred and twenty day clock that the Senate started um um and the president will have to respond to that and decide whether or not to um a whole Saudi Arabia accountable 'em and see you know what what the decision\nIs on on this investigation\nUm I Will just say it was a sweeping and quick action by the Senate here for the it was almost unanimously by the U.S senators on the Foreign Relations committee to uh to launch that\nI'm a hundred and twenty days sanctions clock which you know you rarely see that kind of cooperation anymore here on Capitol Hill right and so it was a real indication\nThat I'm the president is a bit out on his own on this of course secretary pumped pale Mike Pompeo the secretary of state uh went over to Saudi Arabia today um and his meeting with M. B. S. um haven't been solemn um on on the issue I'm\nA ... and and so we'll see you know where the investigation goes\nUm yes than it is a bit isolated on this and my guess is the most ...\nI don't want to his own on this court secretary pumped pale Mike compare the secretary of state uh went over to Saudi Arabia today um and his meeting with NBS I'm On the inside them um on on the issue I'm a ... and and so we'll see\nYou know where the investigation goes on the media than it is a bit isolated on this\nIs my guest is Lisa most ... from the Associated Press the a P interview with the president was today was a late in the day that it actually took place\nYes it was just a a I think are the stories are just posting here within the last hour or so it was in the afternoon as a as far as I Know a\nLot of it a little bit to track of time you know maybe a couple of hours ago yeah who\nIs that I guess up until then another term had no lifted scheduled today and he seems to have spent the day tweeting or were you counting I Know some of the media was counting I think they were up to Seventeen and mid afternoon something like that which is high even for him\nYeah you know it was a I think surprising to a lot of people you know in that schedule comes out usually the night before we get a sense of what the president's doing again I'm up here on Capitol Hill so I don't follow 'em as closely as our White House team does\nBut I definitely noticed it last night when it came over right that there was nothing on his schedule now clearly he had this interview with the Associated Press I imagine he's doing you know other calls and other events\nDavid Greenberg political columnist and author of the book Republican spin\nJobs David Greenberg political columnist and author of the book Republic of spin by the way my crock fact checkers say on the really important stuff that it wasn't angel and very it was Ingrid Bergman in the movie so just putting it out there um and when we come back\nWe will kind of go down the ... and ... do you feel you've been gas let the Trump your and your mental health David Greenberg thanks a lot\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThis is America on the line on kj ...

the steady stream of rough and tumble news about politics and the increasing tenuous relationship of things that are said to be fat and truce\nIs affecting many of us in somewhat less than clinical terms the news is making it was crazy so we brought in an expert Dr Cindy bound Baker a clinical psychologist who is joining us from Philadelphia\nAnd her take is neither political nor predictable she's got so many scenarios of individuals' from left right and other working through their feelings about the country today in various ways couples to\nSo welcome Dr bound Baker thank you very much glad to be here and listeners will take your calls at eight four four seven four or five talk is the news or the political environment\nBeing reported on by news outlets stressing you out how are you dealing with it are you cutting back on news are you watching more news I think we'll hear a story of that as a way to cope\nFrom our guest healthy you're dealing with it how can your experiences help your fellow listeners to cope with what questions might you have for a doctor ban Baker aid for for seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five eight four or five eight four four I'll do that one more\nGoing with it are you cutting back on news are you watching more news I think we'll hear a story of that as a way to cope\nFrom August healthy you're dealing with it how can your experiences help your fellow listeners to cope or what questions might you have for a doctor ban Baker aid for for seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five eight four or five eight four four I'll do that one more time aid for for\nSeven four or five talk\nUm you have so many interesting scenarios let's run a few before run through a few before we take some calls from listeners I'm One of the stories you told us off the air is one member of spousal unit is anxious\nShe's wanting to watch the news all the time the husband just turned off by that because watching the news is making him anxious can you talk about that couple in what they represent\n[noise] yeah sure um you know anxiety management has been really a challenge for a number of people\nAnd we all manage her anxiety differently so for some people the more information they get the more they can reduce their anxiety and for other people the more information they get the more their anxiety ratchet\nUp and the problem happens when you have a couple a where one wants\nTo be listening to the news and watching TV all the time\nSo that his anxiety can uh be lessened and his wife is somebody who when she sees Donald Trump or hears news starts getting more and more anxious\nSo it's affected couples it's affected individuals I I Want to piggyback on something David said sure David\nTV all the time so that his anxiety can uh be lessened and his wife is somebody who when she sees Donald Trump or hears news starts getting more and more anxious\nSo it's affected couples it's affected individuals I I Want to piggyback on something David said sure\nDavid said um you know you ask them about gas lighting and do people really believe you know when the president tells them they haven't seen what they know they've seen and I would say he's not making us crazy but he's crazy making\nAnd it's in the crazy making that people are having difficulty if you if you think of anxiety right how anxiety as a felt sense of no control and unpredictable future a feeling of no escape\nAnd when people have that sense\nAnd if they start worrying and worrying worrying they can we called ruminate are worried they're way down to depression and we of course depression is also the stuff of lost so these are the things I mean I can give you a some clinical scenarios and these are some of the things\nPeople are talking about a lot in my office\nSo let me ask you how you would resolve the first scenario um that you laid out where you have one spouse who wants to watch the news a lot to reduce her anxiety but watching the news makes the husband more anxious how would you counsel a couple of like that\nIn a case like that um she's gonna have to be watching or she is going to be have to be watching the news um when she's not in the bedroom or in the ...\nHave one spouse who wants to watch the news a lot to reduce her anxiety but watching the news makes the husband more anxious how would you counsel a couple of like that\nIn a case like that um she's gonna\nHave to be watching well she she's gonna be have to be watching the news\nUm when she's not in the bedroom or in the living room\nUm and it's a reduction in their shared time I'm a you know it's the the best way to do it I'm there I had one couple that just decided that the bedroom was off limits\nFor the news and um they sort of you know like we do with little kids and we said there are certain rules that you can bring your toys in in certain rooms you can't there are certain rooms in his house you can listen to the news and certain ones you can\nLet me raise one other scenario of yours for listeners before we go to our phone call is um and this really crosses\nParty lines is is not about you taking a political position any is er and so you've talked about how many Democrats are feeling betrayed\nAnd ending by their representatives a sense that yes you know somebody should open their mouth and say this is crazy but many Republicans are feeling Shonda and rejected and wound yet and not understood and they're feeling even silence\nBecause so many Democrats are feeling this rage can you compare and contrast\nWell you know everybody's pain of course has their own pain I think that if somebody who works with a couples as well as individuals with couples oftentimes it's helping one understand the other the communication here each other more I think the issues run deeper now in the divide\nBecause so many Democrats are feeling this rage can you compare and contrast\nWell you know everybody's pain of course has their own pain I think\nThat if a as somebody who works with a couples as well as individuals with couples oftentimes it's helping one understand the other the communication here each other more I think the issues run deeper now in the divide\nI think that um as you say Democrats are feeling really betrayed and Republicans are feeling so rejected and miss understood\nUm and nobody's trusting anybody so when we're we're living in two worlds right we're listening to two different news that's even a word I don't know how many were holed up yet is now um [noise] and we're told the press is the enemy of the state\nSo then who who can be trusted so people aren't trusting each other and with how the sense of trust\nYou know our whole socio emotional world becomes a very dangerous place\nKnown and you see an outgrowth of this in a sort of sense of paranoia [noise]\nUm and and you see this and the object of being a phobia and what's happening with the immigrant families in separating the kids and people in tent cities is terrible or um Charlottesville as a you know an example of that so [noise] uh living\nA lot of people certainly in certain demographic feel unsafe\nAnd I think there's something else that the president's style\nIs one um that's really I'm filled with a lot of uncertainty it's always a changing landscape bright will change change change\nExample of that so\nA lot of people certainly in certain demographic feel unsafe\nAnd I think there's something else that the president's style\nIs one um that's really I'm filled with a lot of uncertainty it's always a changing landscape right change change change change\n'em and that's hard for people and that scares us because it's unpredictable you go back to when I said about anxiety and so what the president has done is he creates a lot of chaos and uncertainty and then he tells people\nThat I Will make America great again and if you just listen to me that other stuff it's fake news it's Maloney does you know blah blah blah listened to me people are holding onto that because they're scared I think everyone is scared\nLet's take a phone call Paul in St Louis on America on the line ...\nThanks for taking my call a type but looking for a long time it's my first time I've ever call you sick like all ... up\nAnd and what you just said actually kind of thought I
