Schultz former CIA director John Brennan and CNN this comes after what happened on Monday when democratic donor George Soros was also a target of one of these devices we don't know who is responsible yet\nSo we're going to take a do take a breath tonight talking about what we know how we got here and what it means for the election in our society and we want to hear from you\nHere's our question tonight what do you tell your children about our politics\nHave you talked about today's news give us a call at eight four four seven four or five talk that's eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five is always you can send us a tweet using the hash tag a O T L we always start off with the latest news and the very latest is that President Trump is campaigning in Wisconsin\nIn Wisconsin this evening for a Governor Scott Walker who is in a very tough reelection race and for live ... who is challenging democratic senator\nTammy Baldwin and what we're interested to see is whether President Trump includes the kind of language he's employed in his other rallies calling out reporters as quote fake news taunting Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters and well you know the rest will see in a while\nAn earlier today in the White House the president called for unity\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that\nIn his other rallies calling out reporters as quote fake news taunting Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters and well you know the rest will see in a while an earlier today in the White House the president called for unity\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nWe have to stress that we don't know who sent these bombs we do know that they were sent to regular targets of some right wing activists in politicians including the president\nSomeone the writer saying it safe a left wing ... perpetrator trying to set up a quote false flag situation to make the right look bad so close to the election\nAnd the timing of this does complicate everything what will be the impact of this attempt to terror will it have a positive effect ratchet the noise level back to maybe a five instead of where it is now or are we so tribal now that we risk making our divisions worse\nLots of questions so let's look for some answers together from some people who know the landscape better than most\nJoining us from Milwaukee Charlie Sykes conservative writer podcaster and author of how to write lost its mind\nHere with me in New York shown waltz national affairs correspondent for the nation and CNN contributor and in Washington White House reporter April Ryan of the American urban radio network all welcome to America on the line April I'm welcome\nYour debut a appearance on America on the line\nAnd thank you for having me on such a cheerful day yes Charlie let me let me ask you start with you by asking has the presidents\nAnd in Washington White House reporter April Ryan of the American urban radio network all welcome to America on the line April\nI'm welcome your debut a appearance\nOn America on the line and thank you for having me on such a terrible day\nYes Charlie let me let me ask you start with you by asking has the president started speaking yet he was scheduled to start speaking at seven thirty pm eastern but last I checked he had not taken the podium\nNo he he did start speaking a little while ago and he said do we will find those responsible we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly\nAnd then he said political violence as an attack on our democracy itself so he followed up the rhetoric we heard from the White House but a obviously a couple of scripted remarks are really don't change the political context of the moment we're in the\nKnow in April is someone who sits in the White House press briefing room whose band that to to rally is like the one that the president is speaking to right now I\nI Would love to get your your um observations your reactions of what that experience is like as a reporter\nSo Jonathan rallies are generally um interesting to watch\nUh the rise and fall of the enthusiasm or the continual wives have it's almost like I'm going to church\nWhere you have the person there who feel the crowd cheered when it's supposed to and and fall down with his coach and listen and cheer when they as opposed to these rallies or something totally different and and just to correct the record I have never been to a Trump rally and I am\nIt is not safe for me to attend a Trump rally at this point because I Am\nConsidered a target um by some of those who\nThe crowd may cheer when it's supposed to do and and fall down and they're supposed to listen to them and cheer when they as opposed to these rallies or something totally different and and just to correct the record I have never been to a Trump rally and I am it is not safe for me to attend a Trump rally at this point ah because I Am\nConsidered a target um by some of those who follow the president\nUm and have had my own death threats um but what I Will tell you is is that um this president I'm In his speech that hurt a little bit of the four jumped on the line with you he um he has to continue what he said this morning\nAnd it's happening to the question is can you change the tone of what he's already started and and the belief ability quotient of this because\nAs I watch today and I'm sure you picked up on it as well with your king inside\nYou we watch the president said and and then his his staff jumped up right away\nBut it took a while for the the rest of the room to follow suit and give a standing ovation and when you talk so vehemently and and have fully towards groups people\nBe it the Democrats who a mob beat reporters who are um uh on American or or opposition party or in these are the people and whatever and talking about you know body slamming a reporter and congratulated met and then changing your speak it\nHe has to be persuasive not just today he's got to sustain this because this is so dangerous now in a dangerous period he's calling for unity he's got to continue now the question is will his supporters believe him you know and right and if he thinks it's something that the change has got to count\nJoined you um and I apologize April for I'm mistaking you'd been to Trump rallies with Joan has been to Trump rallies in June and also as journalists\nDangerous now in a dangerous period he's calling for unity he's got to continue now the question is will his supporters believe him you know and right and if he's going to get something that the change has got to count\nMy job you um and I apologize April for um ... you'd been to Trump rallies with Joan has been to the Trump rallies and Joan also as journalists ... um give your observations of what it's like to be a journalist that a Trump rally\nI haven't been since twenty sixteen but that was scary as scary enough Jonathan I mean you were in a little pen and they're you know all of his supporters were around you and people would chance a CNN sucks I was with MSNBC at the time but I still took it personally uh there was just this\nSense of\nIt I don't want to say violence but you know meals deep men is a and I you know it was it was really uncomfortable I mean I did spend some time sort of wandering outside the pen and that was different but if you could not wear oppressed credential and I once once I got away with that\nBut you know what I Want to say tonight about whatever he says and we don't know yet\nUh but we do know what he said today and it's just because he is who he is I don't want to lower the bar for what we should expect what blew me away today\nAnd I'm Sorry it's still blows me away that he did not mention\nGeorge Soros Brock and Michelle Obama bill and Hillary Clinton Eric Holder Maxine Waters CNN John Brennan that he never\nExpressed any condolence I mean ... is too strong because they're all with us but he never expressed any sense of sympathy for them or their family\nAnd George Soros for Iraq and Michelle Obama bill and Hillary Clinton Eric Holder Maxine Waters\nCNN John Brennan that he never\nExpressed any condolence I mean ... is too strong because they're all with us but he never expressed any sense of sympathy\nFor them or their families or the or the people who work for them or the secret service people who work for them and protected them it it's just all happening in some other realm for him and another president would have to say at least some of the name of the people who have been threatening\n... can I just I Want to address or an ... an elephant in the room and we've got we have to talk about this when we you know sort of mentioned it in the intro and we've been dancing around it but all of the people we have mentioned are all people who have been attacked\n... game by the president name and so I Want to I wouldn't I Would I Want to each of you to answer the question can the president should the president be held\nResponsible for what we saw today okay what degree\nI'll START I mean we've gone through this before or when we you know during the Obama administration when we had another surge of right wing violence when you know Bill O'Reilly\nIt's not okay at all and my prayer he uses that things will change the parts that we continue and an eight seed the white I'm hopeful for a better day I'm hope I believe in this country I Believe it I found it ... I Believe in freedom of the person I Believe in freedom\nAnd took a soldier or overseas right said wherever else that makes for a variety so I don't get it\nFrom Ryan on I Want to thank you for coming on the show tonight Charlie Sykes thank you very much for being on the program joined you're saying with us when we return what's it going to take to get our political environment back to something like normal you're listening to America on the line\nThis is America on the line on ...

what's going on I said this man\nWho is a judge who is really doing that job interview was being very disrespectful to those who were interviewing him and they still confirmed him to a job that's for the rest of their life so they were like how do you get up there with your life\nI'm like well that's what they have what you Supreme Court justice so I'm I Am asking my students if you don't like the way that going maybe should get into politics and try to change that a person can't sit on a job from the Nineteen fifties to twenty eight teams\n[laughter] you know the world has changed so drastically in the last almost a year right now it's still going to die\nOr at least I Do want to thank you thank you for your call and thank you for calling in from from St Louis I Do need to move on to do our panel as the clock ticks down and want to get into the political climate a little more deeply now joining me from Washington is Peter Wehner\nWho is a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center and former advisor to the last three Republican administrations in here with me in Studio in New York Karen Greenberg who is director of the center for national security along with John walls of the nation Peter let me start with you and\nWe had Sarah who um ministers up there in Ohio you are an evangelical Christian you often write about religion and politics do you worry about the tribalism that that divides the [noise]\n[noise] oh yeah I think that the tribalism in America that is one of the chief some problems that um that we face I mean this is always been to some extent the trouble is the country of polarized country that's true every a free country but it's accelerating and its\nAnd write about religion and politics do you worry about the tribalism that that divides the\nOh yeah I think that the tribalism in America that is one of the chief um problems that um that we face I mean this has always been to some extent the trouble is that country of polarized country\nThat is true every a free country but it's accelerated and it's deeper than any town look uh that I can call in uh in my lifetime and\nAh and ah and people are living in in different worlds I'm and the demonization of of American politics is what's striking to me\nUm you know you get the sense of people you look across the divide and you don't just disagree with each other but they think the other person is malicious and middle level and\nAnd the rhetoric is is a is really getting out of out of control and at some point or the rhetoric is out of control of and that can lead to um to to to ...\nSo we're one what her problem was that who's at worst times in this country ... while the civil war Nineteen sixty eight and other periods but this is a difficult\nMoment and uh things are getting worse not better and so we've got to come out of the salesman\nRight caring to pick up on that 'cause I was going to ask you it seems like we're in darker times in our politics are we in darker times in in our politics\nYes but I Want to just pick up on something that he was saying which is that it's easy to say tribalism but one of the things that I think it's really interesting that's happening in the country and it's pushing us into doctor time is that\nThere is we keep talking about these young individuals that are prone to violence to go to violence or or your earlier callers that called in about her four children and her daughter being labeled a certain way right what we see all around us is this post\nWhich is that it's easy to say tribalism but one of the things that I think it's really interesting that's happening in the country and that's pushing us into darker times is that\nThere is we keep talking about these young individuals that are prone to violence to go to violence or or your earlier caller that called in about her four children and her daughter being labeled a certain way right\nWhat we see all around us is this profound identity crisis on a very personal level individuals trying to figure out how to identify themselves how to re identify themselves how to question their identity whether it's gender religion whatever it is\nNow we see a country that's having an identity crisis\nAnd so it seems to me this is sort of bubbling up from the personal to the larger fear and now to the to the very highest\nUm office is in the land and so I I think we need to understand it that way which doesn't minimize the the tribalism but adds a layer to what I actually think it is going on that we need to grapple with are we out of a given what we're\nI'm following today um the pipe bombs and to seven um people and entities as do many CNN or are we added to it I mean are we at a tipping point moment for or am I just being hyperbolic or why\nDon't you know you know I don't think we know we're at a tipping point moment until we tip right when we look back in history [noise] um\nAnd I you know I I basically agree with what Peter said but I guess I Would take a little bit [noise]\nI Would push back a little bit on the word tribalism because it really does it's another one of those words that kind of has a connotation of both sides and I think Peter would agree with me that one side has really gone off the deep end in the last thirty twenty to Thirty years\nSaid but I guess I Would take a little bit\nI Would push back a little

four four seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nKevin I'm the Senate race in Arizona is particularly interesting because no matter who wins the Democrat um which is congressman Christine I'm cinema Moore the Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally there will be a woman\nGoing to the Senate from Arizona I'm next year\nSo wet and go ahead Kevin\nOh yeah and they'll be the first female senator from the state of Arizona the winner or this is something that's been coming up a little bit more and more as more women have run for office we started to see more women versus woman Senate races uh there was one last year in New Hampshire\nA this is one of two this year the other one is in Wisconsin a there is also well I should say one of three and a brass ... Senate race which isn't particularly competitive also has two female candidates are we're starting to see more and more a woman dressed as women Senate races which are extremely uncommon obviously for um mushrooms between laundry\nNow the gap in the polls between the two of them has widened recently with five thirty eight giving cinema sixty three percent chance of winning so ... what do you think is cinema pulling away or is this still a tie\nA brass ... Senate race which isn't particularly competitive also has two female candidates are we're starting to see more and more a woman versus warm in Senate races which are extremely uncommon obviously for um mushrooms between ... now\nThe gap in the polls between the two of them has widened recently with five thirty eight giving cinema sixty three percent chance of winning so ... what do you think is cinema pulling away or is this still a tight race\nThis is still a very tight race cinema is probably a slight favorite um she has a lead in some polls are the political environment also favors are slightly a but it's not a huge margin in this race it would not shocked me at all from exile he pulled us out\nHuh and so the other thing the historic thing here in this race is that if Crist in cinema when\nShe's ... she's the first openly bisexual she would be the first openly bisexual\nI'm senator from Arizona from anywhere in the country and she would be only the second openly algae Beatty senator in the country of course after senator Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin\nHow our next Sally in cinema um framing gender in their in their campaigns as one running towards it and the other one running away from it\nIt's interesting it really doesn't come up that much considering that this is a contest printing two women against each other um there is a gender gap in public polling that favors cinema or you would expect that typically I'm female voters favor Democrats or that situation doesn't necessarily change when both\nCandidates are female and actually in some cases when both candidates are female the gender gap actually gets bigger in favor Democrats or we haven't quite seen that here but neither candidate is necessarily running on you know elect me and I'll be the first woman in part because they're both women although both candidates do I'm sort of emphasize\nHe um female voters favor Democrats or that situation doesn't necessarily change when both\nCandidates are female and actually in some cases when both candidates are female the gender gap actually gets bigger in favor of Democrats or we haven't quite seen that here but neither candidate is necessarily running on you know elect me and I'll be the first woman in part because they're both women\nAlthough both candidates do I'm sort of\nEmphasize I'm sort of some of the historic nature of their candidacies are of their lives um mix Sally we'll talk frequently about how she was the first woman in the U.S military to fly during combat um after the prohibition are women flying in combat was lifted in the early nineties she flew 'em in Desert Storm and\nAfter a and sort of the Afghanistan conflict\nFight following the September eleventh attacks cinema I'm also isn't really want to play up her gender\nUm but she is clearly you know she emphasizes parts of her background as an algae beauty person she played a large role in defeating two propositions that would've banned same sex marriage in Arizona a when she was a state legislator state legislator\nA and but she doesn't really play up the fact that she would be the first uh openly bisexual senator doesn't really talk about the fact that she would be a one of only to uh open the algae team members of members of the Senate and neither does make Sally it's really a and this may be a former progress it's really not an issue at all\nNow when you were on the show a little while back as ... the whole segment talking about the importance of of education as an issue there in Arizona but apparently healthcare is a dominant issue in in Arizona isn't it\nYeah it it's really become the dominant issue in the Senate race I was just at an event cinema was actually holding with a group of teachers that was a a canvas kick off to ah basically\nWhen you were on the show a little while back as ... the whole segment talking about the importance of of education as an issue there in Arizona but apparently healthcare is a dominant issue in in Arizona isn't it\nYeah and it's really become the dominant issue in the Senate race I was just at an event cinema was actually holding with a group of teachers it was a a canvas kick off to ah basically encourage the teachers you know go out and knock on doors for her campaigns are in the vice president of the Arizona Education Association the teachers the major teachers and here\nWas there and even she said that health care was sort of the dominant anywhere in the race more so than education it's really become the dominant issue because Sinema like so many other Democrats around the country\nHas just been hammering mix Sally over a Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare and what that would have done if they had been successful to the protections for people with preexisting conditions in the Obamacare law we've also seen mix Sally this morning a came out with an ad where she claims that she would have\nThat she would protect people with preexisting conditions and they've been fighting the insurance companies that's not really backed up by her votes on Obamacare repeal a experts and\nIndustry groups and advocacy groups all agree that the protections for people in ... with preexisting conditions in the GOP plan to replace Obamacare would have been much much weaker than the ones that are included in the Obamacare law\nNow it is a congresswoman cinema hammering congresswoman mix Sally over the report where mix Sally was quoted as saying ... excuse me at a Republican caucus lunch they report I read said she stood up and said quote let's get this ... thing done\nAbout about the repeal efforts on the part of the Republican Party\nYeah I mean that specifically hasn't come up with that did show you know\nSo mimics Sally over the report where mix Sally was quoted as saying an excuse me at a Republican caucus lunch the report I read said she stood up and said quote let's get this ... thing done about about the repeal efforts on the part of the Republican Party\nYeah I mean that specifically hasn't come up with that did show you know mix was all in on these proposals\nA there was not a lot of hesitancy on her part the way there was some other um Republicans running answering district mhm a lot of Republicans running in spring districts that he's a number of them ended up not voting for the law\nA mix Sally at that time had an yet declared her candidacy for center at the time a Senator Jeff flake we're still expected to run for reelection but she is a she was represented a swing district in Congress ... a district that narrowly voted for Hillary Clinton\nAnd she was still very enthusiastic about repeal at the time ...\nWell I asked folks to call if they if health care was a main issue for them in this election as folks to call a poor for seven four or five eight to five five and Donna from Everett, Washington ah heeded the call Donna as always welcome to America on the line\nThank you for having me so health care is an important issue for you in this election\nYeah for some reason I like to say that I have three children and elderly care at ... ... thing condition children elderly parents and there's a lot of reasons to want health\nCare I'm from Washington and we used to have state health care plan but for the amount of care system came in I liked that system very large and um the problem I handled Obamacare\nIs high end thing a profit high end paying someone else's retirement plan someone else\nChildren elderly parents and there's a lot of reasons to want health\nCare I'm from Washington and we used to have state health care plan before the monetary system came in I liked that system very large and um the problem I handled Obamacare\nIs high end thing a profit\nI end paying someone else's retirement plans someone else's money for their second home ... or send their kids to the college\nInstead as keeping that profit money and my product in line pocket I don't think it's right for a government to
