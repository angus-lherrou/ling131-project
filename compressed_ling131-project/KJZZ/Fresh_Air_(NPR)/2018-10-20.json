left off he was talking about growing up in Birmingham, Alabama where his father was a radio personality what kind of show did your father\nOr my father did he did a jazz show he did a political commentary should but he also did morning news as well so he was like on your way to work and then these days in the eighties you have to remember that black radio was very consolidated saw a black station\nIn the eighties and nineties before the you know corporate split of the the genres of music\nYou would get R. and B. and B. seventies black music during the day you would get current pop hits black pop it in the middle of the day and then at night was rap so all black people listen to the same black station at a different time of day to hear their favorite genre of music\nSo no matter your age you knew who my father was\nWow that that's [laughter] that must have been amazing now you started out as a journalism student in college did your father inspire you to head in journalism to address general journalism career\nRap so all black people listen to the same black station at a different time of day to hear their favorite genre of music so no matter your age you knew who my father was wow\nThat that's [laughter] that must have been amazing now you started out as a journalism student in college did your father inspire you to head into journalism [laughter] to address general journalism career a goal that you did not [laughter] exactly fulfilled and I know that kind of really you're doing you're doing\nUm the Daily Show so there's a lot of news in and it's just a comedy take on real news\nI I did everything in my power to not be like my father why and and 'cause as solid journalism and radio and it was it was cool but I was an adrenaline junkie I wanted to be a fire fighter\nAnd up until my father's death in my senior year of high school that when my father died I still hanging on to being a firefighter and\nComing around into the spring of my high school senior year um I started noticing this guy Stuart Scott on ESPN\nAnd Stuart Scott spoke like me but talked about sports any crack jokes and held that's the same thing we do every day at baseball practice\nI talk about sports crack jokes I could do that and it was an out of disrespect Stuart Scott it was just he doesn't so effortless I don't have soda why it's in that was the first time I saw\nA version of myself ... doing something and so I go what does Stuart Scott what do I need to major in to do that journalism cool signed me up and that's how I found the path to journalism and then ironically here we are Twenty years later and I'm a black man given commentary to people\nAlso to why it's and that was the first time I saw a version of myself mhm doing something and so I go what does stewards got what do I need to major in to do that journalism cool signed me up and that's how I found a\nPath to journalism and then ironically here we are Twenty years later and I'm a black man given commentary to people about the state of the black condition which is exactly what my father did only with no punch lines\n[noise] you mentioned your father died when you were young how did he die or prostate cancer huh that was that there are getting ...\nYeah it yeah it was cancer is a different type of death though where it's not sudden it's not a car crash it's not an accident you know it's you know it's coming and so I reckon with that long\nBefore his death and you know we're also talking about a stubborn man who turned down a great deal of treatment because the treatment would have stopped him\nFrom being able to go to work my father worked um in radio until about three weeks before he died from cancer no chemo taking you know he's getting treatment for the pain but the chemo was going to make them too weak to do radio and\nAnd I really think that's what kept him alive was talking to people\nSo you you carry his name you're very would junior and in Birmingham where you grow up your father's name really meant something after he died what was the significance of the name did people remember him for a long time we still seen as his son for a long time I lived in Birmingham\nBirmingham I'll always be my father son that's just what it is\nAnd to people so you you carry his name you're very would junior and in Birmingham where you grow up\nYour father's name
