to better serve everyone and for\nAnimal rights lawyer Stephen Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise to [noise]\nLike have you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing it's a legal thing\nAnd so OR Books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things [noise] [noise]\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nBut well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer can be a human being it at the time of slavery but person\nHis eyes they're legal things\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nBut well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nAnd the person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman or persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be persons\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons they get is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain\nHow that works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights in national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals that's a cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer\nNow I read Peter Singer is broken\nThe country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal person all to include animals that to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer you\nKnow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I never realized how voice listen defenseless the billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals there's interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human out when I knew it was going to take a long time\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially ... changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that you would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first lawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much\n... the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your\nDream that was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that you would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much have to be done and as I began to try to understand\nWhat the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nHe got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because in Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility to Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures to Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets well now James is God parents swung into action they approached the ...\nA fall Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the anti marry that was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and the demand is that he issue a common law written of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd ... corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat\nBecause of James Somerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should the writ of habeas corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate patient the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James ... of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James summer since I started to look for my lord Mansfield too\nLike the slaves would walked in but as far as ... concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James ... of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James Emerson we began\nWith those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed a hundred and sixty pages of affidavits and we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you wanted to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit what we did is we spent seven years\nHi I'm Heather ... thank

getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make involuntary once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then for those\nWho were still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you've had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my position\nCountries and making sure you had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and\nTo me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be\nSo completely different uh but so much better for my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some pilot population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of a government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous for its by John out of some people\nI'm not tonight I'm Sorry a scotch the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams access and it's just I just got my dog of atoms saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people to all three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world too\nIs is that kind of income\nI Would of course probably want to see it stopped at a\nSmall a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one solution chamber once with decent buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians basically back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for me but uh but this is a path to old is the idea [noise]\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament's tried to say to your friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nRely jerky what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box\nThe surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime yeah\nPerfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread out on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to first get these ... assemblies happening more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million\nPounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with the second buddies selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a hugely ill battle is to try to convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it does it I'm not I think it will be easy to political change is never easy\nUh especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I went to innovate on to\nTry something new I think our system's broken and unknown to

dreamy idea about what the law is this is the fact Mario he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher ... us who has this book between facts and norms and he says democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat are we are one another we want to go together in the law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules and institutions that shape our lives and I I Love this idea of law as the kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between faction norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there is a huge get oftentimes people who need those rules are the most have never even heard of them and um the systems that are supposed to enforce\nThose rules are corrupt or broken\nHe can to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law to the people\nHere say like Mario on the head states\nYeah oftentimes people who need those ruin the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law back to the people\nHere say like Mario on the head stage [noise]\nI Want to tell you about someone I'm going to call them Ravi none of the\nReviews from a community of hurts people included out on the western coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed

in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\nHe said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing none the decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left he walked to the

so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing them to decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory with a bucket of petrol in his head intending to set
