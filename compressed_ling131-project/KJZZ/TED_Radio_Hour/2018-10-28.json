New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of all the way people are able to move on with me\nYeah because I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think\nSo because I mean disability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing as someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like even someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked are bullied went up\nHow many um characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability who's proud on this shamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my father's ... what you can do it yet you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters ...

river was very strong and [laughter]\n\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been punched one too many times [noise]\nToo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think\n[noise]\nSo so when you were a kid I mean for ... you described like but up until the age of five you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back\nTo New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior you know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were\nNot typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an author and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm hysterical [laughter]\nYou know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right up there\nShow and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV and so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his therapy [laughter]\nYou know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons regular or their challenges through humor right and\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and justify telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I founded the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just

saying a couple of dirt comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWith a very weird feeling I was like as a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be

people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you know a lot of their lives with\nThree of them do you know it's incredible that to me that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to be good neighbors um and the one day\nTheir mind even just slightly absolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states blue states and one

get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim\nDoing very publicly Muslim thing was performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found all the way I like to look at it as you you\nGot one person to live in a couple of people will laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and those chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shift in perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these chuckle [noise]\nComedian again first said she's the author of how to make white people\nLaugh and she also

actually makes sense but she's ... she's ready for here though [noise]\nOut of this event was marketed [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living but being funny is also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation\nOr a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be the invitation into ideas and thoughts and stories that might otherwise be\nToo uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBack at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nI was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time and in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled
