you\nThese are some of the ideas that really inspired and moved us and hopefully\nThey'll inspire you to help public radio so that we can continue to produce these amazing stories like this one with Lisa Feldman Barrett she's a professor of psychology at northeastern and a researcher at Harvard Medical school and Lisa is at the forefront of changing even bending some of her\nOld assumptions about emotions and she asks can we really tell how other people are feeling [noise]\nWhen you think about the the science of emotions what looked like the traditional scientific view of them well\nWhen I entered graduate school the assumption was that your brain comes pre wired with the so called basic emotions\nAngers atmosphere discuss happiness and surprise dysfunction is that\nUm that that our brains can pre wired to make these emotions and that when something trips one of these sort of gets you know let's say fear that um we will have a very specific physical response heart rate will go up and maybe we'll freeze\n'em our faces will make a particular expression that\nDisplays the emotion on the face for others to see and recognize universally and that that will reveal to you kind of like a fingerprint or what emotional state someone is in\n... and and do you think that's true I mean to do\nUm have a very specific physical response heart rate will go up and maybe will freeze 'em our faces will make a particular expression that\nDisplays the emotion on the face for others to see and recognize universally and that that will reveal to you kind of like a fingerprint or what emotional state someone is in\nAnd and do you think that's true I mean do do emotions apply to all people universally across the board\nNo they don't we know that all of these emotion categories appear in many cultures but they also failed to appear in some cultures for example sadness doesn't occur in to ... and I'm In Russian there are multiple sadness is not just one\nAnd the point is that you know new set of physical sensations has a purely psychological meaning that his constant across all instances and all\nPeople people often phrase the question is to say to the human brain come pre wired with the capacity to make angers atmosphere disgusting so on and the answer is no Lisa Feldman Barrett spoke about her ideas from the state [noise]\nMy research labs since about a mile from where several

S. E. W. dot org\nHey welcome back to this special edition of the head radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and this hour we're listening to some of our best segments of the season it's from an episode we called inspired to action aired this past may end this interview with writer and activist Naomi Klein and she asked in the midst of so many global crises\nHow can more of us take action mass movements always take people by surprise\nYou know if you talk to two organizers admit there's a certain magic of just like why this time of night last time you know so I'm interested in that question why this time and not not ... but also because I've been around for a little while and I've I've seen some of these\nMidst of so many global crises how can more of us take action mass movements always take people by surprise\nYou know if you talk to two organizers bill admit there's a certain magic of just like why this time of night last time you know so I'm interested in that question why this time and not that time but but also because I've been around for a little while\nAnd I've I've seen some of these magical moments um and I've seen them kind of disappear as quickly as they arose I become increasingly interested in what keeps people in motion\nWhat's the glue\nYears nearly climb on stage and I'd say this is a pressing question these days\nBecause things are pretty shocking out there\nAnd now there's no shortage of people who are sounding the alarm but as a society [noise] I don't think we can honestly say that we're responding with anything like the urgency that these overlapping crises demand from us\nAnd yet we know from history that it is possible for crisis to catalyze kind of evolutionary leaked and one of the most striking examples of this progressive power of crisis is the great crash of Nineteen twenty nine\nAnd this was taken by many as a message that the system itself was broken and many people listened and they left into action now these reforms were ... far from perfect in the U. S. African American workers immigrants and women were largely excluded\nBut the depression period along with the transformation of allied nations in economies during the world war two effort show us that it is possible for complex societies to rapidly transform themselves\nInto action now these reforms were far from perfect in the U. S. African American workers immigrants and women were largely excluded\nBut the depression period along with the transformation of allied nations in economies during the world war two effort\nShow us that it is possible for complex societies to rapidly transform themselves in the face of a collective threat that was that's really what it took him why isn't working anymore why do two days nonstop shocks\nWhy don't they spur us into action [noise] seems\nLike people are really upset about a lot of these global crises but it's they're not nothing seems to be changing so what what's the missing element\nNow well I think that they're real missing ingredient or one of them\nHas to do with you know what I Would call the utopian imagination of\nOf not just a horror and rejection at something that we're seeing now but it actually articulated vision of the world we want instead and I think that previous generations of activists of organizers\nYou know for better and worse had that utopian vision of of the world they wanted instead they didn't identify as I\nAm an environmental activist I Am a women's rights activists I Am a civil rights activists it was more like I'm a revolutionary [laughter] I Am not just resisting what I don't want\nI Know the world I Want instead and I think that it's in that interplay between a vision of the world we want instead and horror in the face of what our current system is producing that both catalyze is people into movement and keeps them in the movement because the posture of rejection of\nOf enough ness of no\nI'm a revolutionary huh I Am not just resisting what I don't want I Know the world I Want instead and I think that it's in that interplay\nBetween a vision of the world we want instead and horror in the face of what our current system is producing that both capitalize this people into movement and keeps them in the movement because the posture of rejection of\nOf enough ness of no\nIs a powerful cattle as to bring people in the streets but it's it's an exhausting\nPosture to maintain and I think part of the burnout comes from\nThe fact that what sustains people in struggle is that hope of what what there could be instead rejection alone\nI think turns toxic\nAnd and it's just exhausting its fighter flight you can't stay and fight or flight forever\nWe're living at a time of extraordinary political engagements politics is a massive session\nAnd you have to still doesn't\nAdd up to the kind of holistic and universal this vision of a different world that our predecessors had so why is that [noise]\nWell very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days environment in one box inequality in another racial and gender justice in a couple of other boxes education over here health over there\nAnd with each compartment there are thousands upon thousands of different groups in NGOs each competing with one another for credit name recognition and of course resources\nSo for instance that people fighting poverty and inequality rarely talk about climate change even though we see time and again that it's the poorest of people who are the most vulnerable to extreme weather the climate change people\nWell it's ends upon thousands of different groups in NGOs each competing with one another for credit name recognition and of course resources\nSo for instance the people fighting poverty and inequality rarely talk about climate change even though we see time and again that it's the poorest of people who are the most vulnerable to extreme weather\nThe climate change people rarely talk about war and occupation even though we know that the thirst for fossil fuels has been a major driver of conflict the environmental movement\nHas gotten better at pointing out that the nations that are getting hit hardest by climate change our populated overwhelmingly by black and brown people\nBut when black lives are treated as disposable in prisons in schools and on the streets\nThese connections are two rarely made [noise]\n\nWhen it comes to to building a a sustainable movement is about sort of breaking down these compartments that you describe and then trying to connect all these different groups and issues\nI think it is and I think that I'm over the past\nThirty years there has been this process of\nExtreme professionalized nation of activism where we ... the world into these single issue silos and then people get funding based on which silo they're in and it makes movements more inclined\nTo set out very compartmentalized achievable wins that they can then go back to their ... saying\nLook we won right but if you're talking about deep systemic change whether it's you know in the face of systemic racism or whether it's in the face of climate change or whether it's in the face of economic inequality you're not going to get that easy when you you know it's going to take decades\nMeant more inclined to set out very compartmentalized achievable wins that they can then go back to their ... saying\nLook we won right but if you're talking about deep systemic change whether it's you know in the face of systemic racism or whether it's in the face of climate change or whether it's in the face of economic inequality you're not going to get that easy when you're you know it's going to take decades [noise]\nUm when you think about all of these enormous\nChallenges these generational challenges these civilization all challenges that the human race faces are you optimistic\nI mean do you think that we will actually rise to these challenges and and build the movements require to overcome them\nI have good days and bad days on that question I think about the stakes of you know if if we don't change than what happens then what is the future look like for my five year old son um it's so unacceptable\nIs so dangerous\nAnd maybe it's time for the people who stop believing change is possible to step aside and just make some room you know one of the things you realize is there is a natural regeneration in in social movements\nWhen when young people come in who have not um experienced as many disappointments setbacks in their ... to go and refused to accept\nNo for an answer and impossible for an answer I see that ah\nIn the way the Parkland\nTeens responded to challenges that their movement only represented a narrow experience of gun violence and didn't get defensive and and listened and\nSapped no for an answer and impossible for an answer I see that in the way\nThat Parkland teens responded to challenge is that their movement only represented a narrow experience of gun violence and didn't get defensive and and listened and\n\nSo one day take the apple that your thumb always seems to gravitate towards to get off your phone and observe what it feels like and then decide do you want it back on your phone call go for it if you do but do not\nLet the tech companies decide as their decision making don't let that be the default which it very much has become I think for consumers\nTens of thousands of people who signed up for the challenge\nTo gravitate towards take it off your phone and observe what it feels like and then decide do you want it back on your phone call go for it if you do that do not let the tech companies decide as their decision making don't let that be the default which it very much has\nBecome I think for consumers\nSo out of the tens of thousands of people who signed up for the challenge some of them called her up because they started to realize that their relationship with their phone had kind of become dependent and\nDo relationship between uh maybe you have you bear or a baby and drinking or a baby that was it was mother's cradle was going to be held a stranger [laughter] that's the relationship ...\nI think was my phone led a power tool ... both but dangerous if I'm not handling it properly if I don't pay close attention suddenly realize that I've lost an hour time doing something totally mindless [noise]\nOkay but to really measure any improvement we needed data right 'cause that's what we do these days so we partnered with some apps that would measure how much time we were spending everyday on our phone\nAnd if you're thinking it's ironic that I asked people to download another app so that they would spend less time on their phones yeah but you got to meet people were there [laughter]\nBut when the data came in it turned out that we hadn't cut down on average just six minutes from a hundred and twenty minutes a day on our phones to a hundred and fourteen\n[laughter] what do you do [laughter]\nIt's amazing that you you got so many people involved and then looked at the data and turned out that people just see six minutes a day to sort of like like be fleeting right I mean after all this effort\nSix minutes from a hundred and twenty minutes a day on our phones to a hundred and fourteen\n[laughter] what do you do [laughter] [noise]\nSo it's amazing that you you got so many people involved and then looked at the data and turned out that people just seem six minutes a day to sort of like like be fleeting right I mean after all this effort people are only six minutes a day which tells us\nSomething about ourselves yeah I mean it's all well first of all it tells me that I have been trained to expect next returned hey you know Shia we expecting huge numbers and I was I thought six minutes was nothing\nBut when I went back to the scientists and researchers were who were advising me on this they\nI'm not joking they laughed in my face there were like who says six minutes isn't significant and frankly like you know the fact that you got people to change their behavior at all over a week is extraordinary and listened to the stories because the stories\nWill tell you so much more than any data can and that's what people told me they told me stories about how they realized they used to relax by playing the guitar and then they suddenly understood that they they hadn't played it in years or\nThings bigger than that um that people had sat down just thought about what the family dynamics were and get to a better place in their relationship there were all these amazing stories that people told us and I thought you know what you're right\nAfter the six minutes right [laughter] yeah totally like let's stop giving boredom such a bad rap it actually is an extremely important human function that we are starting to just sort of\nThought about what the family dynamics were and get to a better place in their relationship there were all these amazing stories that people told us and I thought you know what you're right\nAfter the six minutes right [laughter] yeah totally like let's not giving boredom such a bad rap it actually is an extremely important human function that we are starting to just sort of\nBreed out of our daily lives and I sort of look around and I see there's lots of things like that um downtime eye contact\nConversations out loud where people stutter or make mistakes or take more than a quick you know a hundred and forty characters to figure out what they want to say we've lost the capacity in many ways I think for patients\nIf we want to have an excellent idea is the best ideas we need to let them take the time to take root and then blossom and that does not happen in a tap of a of an ... yeah we're here since we need time\nAnd that's the one thing that our phones can't give us more of\nIt's my new some early she hosts the podcast zigzag and his co founder of the
