responsible drinking and from the any Casey foundation\nIt's the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in our show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking to a biochemist Sam Steinberg who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like super heroes right perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right\nThose are the yoga I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nCRISPR could aware [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart\nDisease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nWould that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a higher accused you can imagine that people would want to take advantage\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that that technology is promising like if there was a you know way to make a child more resilient to pan or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you nailed delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIt's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see\nBut kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes use your five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their\nThat should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think\nYou have this very ... issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it in embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated\nWith higher IQ were being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise]\nHamster and Derek is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think about power to control an illusion you can check out his attack at ... dot com\n\nOn today's show we're asking a very important question which is\nWho are we [noise] okay do you have the answer dino who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I really I have a a a an inkling of who we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind in human nature\nSo ... what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell ... there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain are fabricated over millions\nAn employer who we are\nThis is Steven Pinker\nI Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\nSo get what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell it there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection\nThat he quips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just sad and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with us okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from the historian was going to take a godsend man has no instincts from the anthropologist ... human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J\nLate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that man\nHas no nature from historian Jose Ortega you got that man has no instincts from the anthropologist actually ...\nThe human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J gold\nNow ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are a number of political reasons why people have found congenial for most stupid or if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the slate then some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnd other political sphere of human nature it's better\nIf we were blanks place we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly interesting and perhaps some of them like condemned us to selflessness prejudice and violence first of all\nThere are a number of reasons to doubt perfect human mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and talented doesn't all come from the outside oh and anyone who uh\nHas both a child and a house that has certainly noticed that the child exposed to speech for require human language whereas the house that won't presumably because of
