Appalachia ends that we're in this monoculture hum the current information and it is is that we're all scotch Irish and their own irritated um [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everything he thinks Rob scotch Irish [noise]\nBefore my interview with one day I checked with mark Polanski well known for his book such as hard and soft now his latest book her landscape tells a story of milk [noise]\nMark how are you I'm great how are you ah well I'm thrilled to talk to you um I read cod did was my first ... book a long time ago on your latest book milk I also found to be at least as interesting as cod\nSo let's start at the beginning I guess the ... people believe that the world started with a huge drop of milk\nYeah I mean a lot of cultures have creation myths that involve mill and I guess it's not surprising because milk is associated with child birth so it's the beginning of life\nWell but but some of those examples were great that the north legend the huge frost ogre sustained by cow made from falling frost vicious new churned to see of milk to create the universe it it was more don't don't try this at home [laughter]\nI can sure to glass of milk like this has got a military um\nSaid it with child birth so it's the beginning of life\nWell but but some of the examples were great in the north legend the huge frost ogre sustained by a cow made from falling frost vicious new churned a sea of milk to create the universe it it was more don't don't try this at home [laughter]\nI can sure to glass of milk and just as good a military um the other thing you say is interesting is that what forty percent the Chinese today drink milk\nYeah which is interesting because that's actually the world average about forty percent of people in the world drink milk about sixty percent of the people in the world are lactose intolerant\nBut but the theory was and you explain that you need lactase to digest lactose and milk and the theory was Europeans do not have the gene the cuts off the production of lactase when you get older\nWell everybody is supposed to everybody who and they get to about two years old this enzyme lactase is supposed to ah\nStop working and then lactose becomes into jazz festival some people and that tends to be a Europeans middle Easterners sub consummate have a genetic mutation where this doesn't happen and that's why they can drink milk it's interesting that this mutation that we have\nIs presented as normal and the normal people are presented as having an illness [laughter] that's true actually lactose intolerance is what's supposed to be friends\nUm you said it was just a shocking there was an Eighteen hundred it was a Dublin hospital that had Ninety nine point six percent infant mortality rate\n[noise] yeah I mean what was called artificial feeding feeding children animal mill\nAre presented as having an illness [laughter] that's true actually lactose intolerance is is what's supposed to be\nFriends um you said that there was a just a shocking there was an Eighteen hundred it was a double in hospital that had Ninety nine point six percent infant mortality rate\n[noise] yeah I mean what was called artificial feeding feeding children animal milk was not a widespread thing until the Eighteenth century and and the Eighteenth and Nineteen century it caused huge infant mortality rates\nBut the supermarket eggs are that's rinsed off and then they read or oil them or they put something on the outside to protect the egg but they're very very well clean Christmas right it's the outside of the egg that really you need to make sure gets cleaned you know it's one of those things you know you you want to say the over eighty the under five in the immune impaired perhaps should not have\nThese eggs in leather taken to at least one sixty but I think other than that you know you're fine you know just don't leave them\nThey ... they put something on the outside to protect the

us an email questions at ... radio dot com\n[noise] Hi this is Terri Hi how are you I'm fine how can we all do well I\nRemember hearing on your show I think a very simple recipes great grays\nOr um something to put on steak when you're grilling it using ground that molasses friends and I looked and looked to try and find something like that so I'm Wondering if they can give me some ideas\nOf ways ... rather than the last us and very simple recipes like for really chicken or steak or even vegetables anything like that\nYeah you can um it's available on almost any supermarket now my ... which is the brand we so we think is the best but how do you spell that am Y. M. O. U. and puffy\nAnd that's great but for grill your point us matter I Would just brush it on either in the last thirty seconds of grilling straight up straight up or as soon as it comes off the grill you don't want it on\nYeah you can um it's available on almost any supermarket now my ... which is the brand we sell we think is the best but how do you spell M y M O U and pasta fee\nAnd that's great but for grilling it probably doesn't matter I Would just brush it on either in the last thirty seconds of grilling straight out straight up or as soon as it comes off the grill you don't want it on very long because it'll burn\nThe other thing I Do with pomegranate ... is that a small amount to offend the correct her dressing it's as you know is sweet and sour and they just add tremendous jets to that so those are two of the things I Do with it and just as an ingredient sometimes I'll put a little at a stew\nJust to add a little bit of depth sort of a secret ingredient\nBy any kind of meats do I find meat and pomegranate ... go well together any beef stew parks do lamb stew at the end you can put in a tablespoon of ... just to add a little depth to it and nobody will know what it is but it just adds flavors\nThey're adding a little bit of sweet and\nSour yeah I find is probably one of the most useful pantry staples I have if you want to make a tip of some kind of it goes well in Greek yogurt you can add a little bit to that along with some fresh herbs or other things other spices but I Would take lazy and vinegar credits and adding to students are three things I Do Sarah\nI add all of that sounds good to me I mean for people who don't know what pomegranate molasses is like it's a little bit like ... what I might do for a glazes combine it with a little bit of butter and some Dijon mustard and then just put it on in the end yeah maybe a little bit of garlic now\nYou're French or fight it but I Do [laughter] All right Terry thanks very early on you have a ...\nAnd listening to the radio I'm Christopher Kimball coming up next my interview with running Monday\nAnd it with a little bit of butter and some Dijon mustard and that just put it on in the end yeah maybe a little bit of garlic\nNow you're French or fight it but I Do [laughter] All right Terry thanks very early on by by mhm\nListening to radio I'm Christopher ... coming up next my interview with one Monday ... author of noodles and Appalachian Journey with recipes we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nSupport for Christopher symbols milk street comes from Ferguson Ferguson bath kitchen and lighting gallery probably supports nope street corner crusaders everywhere bath Kitchener lighting collections in several styles available in store and online at ... dot com\n... you're listening to ... and this is our October new member Dr ... depends on the financial supportive listeners\nBut the largest and most important source of funding for the fact\nBased news coverage than you count on the news and entertainment on key genes easy is made possible with numbers support and programs like milk street radio are part of the service we already knew every Sunday please consider setting up a monthly sustaining membership maybe ten Fifteen or twenty five dollars mountain\nTake a minute or two right now and give to the service you depend on ... on your support is critical and we thank you\n... ... reporting on Jay Jay's easy has made possible in part list of or drug before ... addressing the quality and all its warms worldwide learned more at Ford Foundation dot org\n\nUs but I was reporting on er Jersey is very possible that part was ... before foundation addressing either quality and all forms worldwide or more abhorrent voted for God or\n\nThis is mostly radio on Christopher Kimball Ronnie ... years driving around Appalachia in search of the region's history recipes and traditions ... book ... recounts her journey exploring everything from Chile bonds to a dozen different types of local beans\nRonnie how are you I'm well Chris how are you I'm good I'm ... let's talk about ... what is it an amalgam of a million different kinds of things if you were to describe it is there a way to describe it to make sense or is just too diverse\n[noise] um the way to describe it makes sense says to accept that it's complicated and a moving target somewhat um and in that you can shape parameters around it but those parameters some time shift also ah the territory that I looked at\nEnded at West Virginia and it goes down and choose the northern edge of South Carolina I'm In the mountains of north Georgia and Alabama and of course ... Kentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina\nAnd if I left anybody out please don't hurt me um [laughter] um and so so even the geographic definition I can stretch and come together\nDo you you drove your van right is that right when you're driving\nI have a van it's a Chevy astro\nI got it [laughter] so how many miles how long you set out to do this trip\nAnd North Carolina and if I left anybody out please don't hurt me um [laughter] with 'em and so so even the geographic definition a can stretch and come together\nDo you you drove your ... your drug\nAnd I have a van it's a Chevy astro\nAre [laughter] so how many miles how ... you set out to do this trip is this a pilgrimage uh what were you looking for how long were you doing\nHonestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles and then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that so it was quite it was it was very literally a journey into the subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipes\nAnd that was important to me because a lot of what is written and has been written about um the people and the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nWell a lot of comments from one person's perspective and their family but there are other experiences in Appalachia and I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we're at this monoculture hum\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated um [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks rough scotch Irish [laughter] um so they're they're actually the last census\nThere are more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American there are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point I Am my interest is that if you look at the food way you can start to pick apart this complexity and see all the strands\nAre more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American then there are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point in my interest is that if you look at the food way\nYou can start to pick apart this complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge uh some of the assumptions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about on the Appalachian\nA perfect poised to talk about food so you are you say chili bonds carried out from the Dixie pool wraps ugly in red Greece licked wax paper were my favorite show now and now now defend that so so these were really good ... or what\nOh heck yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain a chili plant is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy\nChili mixture hamburger mix here that is packed into a hotdog bond with onion and with mustard and the texture is extremely important that it's not like a sloppy Joe it's it's not kind of slurping around in there it's in there or being I'm\nFrom and the best way to think about this is this is this is a dish that was to my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat you don't want something\nWhat Chile on your hands\nRight yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that and that but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food you know this really through the shacks sweet and savory banana pudding it had\nWell and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat you don't want something your chili on your hands right yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that and that but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food you that this really through the ... sweet and savory banana pudding\nIt had powder jolt of the custard okay I can forgive you that but has written a new face red ... now now wait a minute now that's that's a that's a ... thing when you're ... red meat so into a savory banana pudding what's going on\nAnd well we are being first of all true to the Appalachian palate one of my mother's favorite terms\nYou know growing up in Vermont the locals have a team says place one family named history too\nYou know growing up in Vermont the locals had a keen sense of place one family name their street tutor road and the next week neighbors across the way to put up a sign Skidmore for every hill and valley was named for reason minister hills swearing hills southeast quarters wrote in bear mountain\nAppalachian takes its name seriously to Logan giant greasy cut short or the names of Appalachian beans today things are named by marketing directors in Appalachia names so real stories about\nReal people in a place in some lucky people\nEven get to calls home\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto general\nJ. Maria I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is I and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time but it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well came through base was better than ours but\nYou went to Italy yup to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nKnow one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything rough\nFirst of all our ratios ingredients are way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough days old they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist with that\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta cooked\nOf all our ratios ingredients for weight off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in ... in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough Faisal they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist with that\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course produced a thicker more luxurious sauce we think we have to finish beforehand that doesn't work\nI also learned that we get the order wrong and the order in which you add ingredients to either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the nasal for example into soon you're gonna over process that are over ... and that's going to give you the wrong finished consistent\nSo your goal here is to get a pest that's pretty dry it's not the green sauce right it's dry\nExactly it's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it as a soft before it touches the pasta but really if it's a loose then you've added to much olive oil and in general is has to be done until it's been added to pasta with some of the pasta water\nThen it's considered pets or not it's considered a complete but that's why I say we are way too much olive oil are we supposed to be thinner at an earlier state so\nWhat's the order of the angry okay the orders very important again because you don't want to order process the ingredients you start out with the garlic to find out to salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find tasted it usually distributed through the ...\nThen we had our cheeses you want them finally ground add those ... and again you add those to the high end up in the garlic and you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the chiefs now the ... the wealthiest we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the baseball in like they do in Italy\nReason is they use smaller more tender base and they're able to just pulse of the few times and it's done our case most of the base where we find at the grocery store tends to be kind of\nThen we add our she's she wants to finally ground add those in and again you add those to the wind up in the garlic you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the chiefs now the baseball goes it but one of the things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the base but when they do in Italy\nReason is they use smaller more tender base and they're able to just posted a few times and it's done our case most of the day is what we find at the grocery store tends to be kind of bigger and a little bit heartier and we had trouble getting it to the right consistency without over processing it and try to get into a watery puree but\nThe solution actually was pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on a cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of pulses and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general what we use food processors just as probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had in general\nWell get lax the romance of bashing it with a mortar intestinal but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the word that we're getting really close and I got to say it is delicious\nSo Jim ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as the real thing thanks Jim Baker Mm\nYou can get this recipe for pesto

Megan how can we help you today [noise]\nI have a question about no doubt and that size of the can and should be cooking it in in terms of the surface area in the race like won that race like through I'd want there to be a single layer of ... and or do I want it to be stopped at all\nWell interesting you should ask this question because for years I always cooked it in a sauce pan you know which was straight sides in order to act like you said\nBut um I had a wonderful young woman work on my last cookbook home cooking one oh one and I asked her to contribute a recipe and she spent her junior year in Italy and she'd learned to make Rizzo do so she did a very unique Rizzo do but she cooked in in a large scale it\nAnd she said that's what they did\nAnd so now I'm sort of changed my opinion Chris\nWell our editor Jane her she was just in Italy getting results of the lessons near belong or in Milan from ... yeah and they cook it in about ten minutes to cook it very fast ten or Fifteen minutes they don't do the long slow sing plenty of starch comes out of the two critic creamy sauce\nAnd so the whole notion of his thirty minute low and slow it was just complete not all that stuff on how they cook it what kind of him it's a wider paying like a skill yeah yeah it's fun\nBut this whole low and slow doesn't really that's fascinating stirring all the time you know they started off stirring and then they just let it cook and stir occasionally so you don't have to stir constantly either\nLet me guess has this recipe going to be in the magazine\nCourteous oh dear I didn't look at my last ditch all air oh no I'm In trouble I'm In trouble so we've been reading blown up and to you know I may do that that's OK so which is used it in September October yeah okay I Would say a larger surface area is a good thing yeah\nWonderful thanks very good thank you so much yeah right\nOccasionally so you don't have to stir constantly either let me guess has this recipe going to be in the

Chrissie from sturbridge Hi how are you how can we help you\nI'm good my question is about sesame seeds my friend recently had her baby and then when she went that Dr ... she was allergic\nTo sesame seed now all of a sudden I mean love making hummus together we also like cooking a lot of Asian dishes that sesame oil so we're trying to figure out okay what do we go now to replace the sesame component and in hummus and also for the sesame oil\nIs she ... to nuts or just sesame to the actual sesame seed ... you know an almond butter would be okay for example\nOn butter I think would be okay the hummus I think was a little bit easier question we also heard that if you ate he potentially that could help with the flu is I don't know if you ever heard of that\nIt's also a flavor issue though I think a little bit right yeah like a lot yeah\nYou know um I agree I think I'm In butter would be great for some other no butter yeah\nAs for the component in Asian cooking you could try toasted pumpkin seeds oil\nOh it's okay it's a wonderful ingredient and it's dark and it's just you and me and I think that would work but I Do is very strong now so but you know be light toasted sesame seed will be careful with it because it can take over\nOkay but I think that would be wonderful and it's more readily available than it used to be it's one of those ingredients that people are
