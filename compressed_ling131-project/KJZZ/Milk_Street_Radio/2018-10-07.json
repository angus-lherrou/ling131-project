versus let's say traditional Mexican cooking what what would be some of those ingredients so\nInterestingly one of those ingredients as human\nSan Antonio there's actually a small but significant population people who came from the Canary Islands and the thought is that there's so much human in Chile and therefore started moving forward a lot of Tex Mex\nCooking because of the influences that

became the first female restaurant critic at the New York times\nAnd went on to reinvent the genre using disguises to get an honest meal also employing a smart literary style of writing today shares in his Ninety two years old and with no plans to retire she's currently a columnist at the Daily Beast and just launched a new special series with the sport full podcast\nMimi how are you I'm very well very well I\nI don't want to rehash too many things everyone does but uh in December Seventy five you became the food critic for New York times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the times is that correct\nOr not quite the woman who wouldn't hire me\nWorked full podcast maybe how are you\nI'm very well very well\nI I don't want to rehash too many things everyone knows but ah in December Seventy five you became the food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the times is that correct\nOr not quite the woman who wouldn't hire may was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire may name was Charlotte Kurdish\nThe woman who did hire me was Joan Whitman and of course hired by the editor of the paper Abe Rosenthal\nYou still remember both of those names yeah [laughter] well ... fortunately for all of us you\nBecame a critic uh first of all it's a very artificial way of eating because you go with the crowd everybody orders different foods you get to taste\nYou can't just enjoy one thing or two things you have to try to eat everything obviously has critic is that something you eventually get used to and and get to like or is it always a a burden but as you would prefer not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested\nTo know what I Would find out and I think when you do it that way you kind of know how to separate flavor is in your mind did was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could eat the same thing tonight and have a ship experience\n[laughter] yeah well it sounds like me [laughter] so\nWe did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or in the end\nKind of know how to separate flavor is in your mind it was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could eat the same thing tonight and have a shift experience\n[laughter] yeah well that sounds like me [laughter]\nSo we did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or in the end where people often do go was crowds uh\nIt was never more than four people and usually just my husband and myself on the first try to see what's going to be worth reviewing before we filed a lot of people and expense into it\nI Know that other critics after you at the times got a lot of press in ink about dressing up in disguises but you are the I think the first one to really do that I I Love this quote a ... you said even before the Internet I was recognized a few times\nThey are very few things more ... to show up in the wake of glasses and have the owners say quote good evening Mr\n[laughter] exactly I Would say [laughter]\nYou don't know what to do should I flipped off they'll dig should I you know play at staying here are thirty and I had glasses and wigs I didn't I didn't wear strange outfits though\nIt now let's talk about one of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop Eli et cetera\nYou're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices and I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers which really like Yelp and so on are so right I I actually agree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right\nWell first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but even more I have never seen and um\nLot of voices that I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers which really like Yelp and so on are so right I I actually agree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right\nWell first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but even more I have never seen and I'm willing to be wrong on this I have never seen any such service require proof that the person has been a good point\nI have gotten him in the past not for a long time justice on a mailing list for example many years ago\nThe questionnaires from the gas ... asking me to be a response to do with all the things the frail and\nAnd I thought how do they know if I'd been there I didn't even ask Tim's a gap that and he said we have a way to which I say baloney because you could just a ... if it's a friend who owns the restaurant or a relative\nOr if you just want to sound often use you repeat that kind of rating from your local critic just to have a voice in there so\nI don't really care what those people say\nYeah that that's true I mean social media you see all sorts of strange comments and their access to the ground all over\nSo let's talk about casual dining I think you and I come out of the same place you walk into a restaurant and the first Fifteen or thirty seconds what are some of the things that the you'll notice I won't either good or bad\n\nI might notice the number of help on the floor I might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and I'm moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty I might notice the ...\nWhat are some of the things that the you'll notice I won't either good or bad\n\nOh I might notice the number of help on the floor I might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and are moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty\nI might notice the overall age of the people I might notice if there are serving stations around the room I'll tell you a funny story about that there is a super Greek diner in Chicago known is Lou Mitchell's\nAnd it's right near the American to exchange in the stock exchange and it opens four or five in the morning because the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just larger than life\nAt the breakfast and I went one morning alone because I was writing about Chicago restaurants I went around eight thirty and I have to stand on line a little and uh she does the owner or his manager gives out little boxes of I'm a\n... a candy what do they call it any way to to women standing on the line and finally after about Fifteen minutes I became the head of the line and the manager came over to me and said where is your place\nAnd I said what place and he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\nHuh [laughter] I really didn't for [laughter] it's like a Campbell or in a casino like you look around and milk\nOr just what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line and you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast Scott\nAnd he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\nHuh [laughter] I really didn't for [laughter] it's like a gambler in a casino like you look around and milk\nOr just what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line and you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast Scott\nCooked prone and a slice of orange and a little cup of yogurt no matter what you would if I imagine it's still the same but it was wonderfully observant of this man to notice my eyes working the room\nMark I I'm ... you'd like Joel rubbish wrong or in his cooking when you talk about his famous potatoes with a pound of butter in a pound of cooked puree potatoes but\nJust throwing the pot cooking alone slow come back a few hours later it's done I made this recipe before but the problem with a recipe I think is that when you just put wind would be in a pot it takes a lot of the flavor out of it\nIt takes a lot of the flavor out of the meat the meat is hardly flavor was and the wind is enriching puncture is it's kind of just the city can kinda nasty actually\nSo I I don't know how they're used to doing Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen would we do\nSo critically really took the wind out of the equation in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation\nAnd so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of these really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pepper and we put that in a pot with some aromatic and no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to brace is neat comes from the meat itself\nThere's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavor so you end up with a really concentrated meat\nJuice and you're not sought tanks and be before you put it in just you cook the ... a little bit then put the meat and when you're not doing anything else would lead before because there\nWere not that we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of saw tend to me without actually having to do the work which you know we love around here so instead of cooking at the whole time covered we take the cover off after a couple of hours\nAnd let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning on the meat there that you would have gotten if you were taught to hate it at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the ones who are the ones not in the ones waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the recipe at the end I Hope\nIt does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning really diluted not only the flavor of the sauce the kind of made\nAnd let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning underneath there that you would have gotten if you were taught to hate it at the beginning that without all the work\nSo what about the ones who are the ones not in the ones waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the recipe at the end I Hope\nIt does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning really diluted not only the flavor of the sauce the kind of made a meat tastes a little weird as well\nSo we waited until the very end to add that so we take them eat out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strangely chooses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich sauce\nSo this recipe the Tuscan leave from peppers do almost no prep work cook a little use tomato paste the meat in three hours in the oven take it out reduced some warning through that any are done it's amazing and it tastes great taste so good when thank you You're welcome\nYou can get this recipe for Tuscan beef and peppers do have one seven seven milk street dot

and I really appreciate all of that you and Chris exposes too and provide thank you I like to cook and I really um I read something new and I want to try you know these new global type recipes\nMy question for you is what some pantry staples that would bring in a more global fair that I could use regularly in my cooking\nOh boy yeah we're we're going to have to pick and choose and you asked us to limit it and that's hard it's like well you want to start with spice blends first\nUm I read something new and I want to try you know these new global type recipes my question for you is what some pantry staples that would bring in a more global fair that I could use regularly in my cooking\nBoy yeah we're we're going to have to pick and choose and you asked us to limit it and that's hard it's like well you want to start with spice blends first and then move on those are I mean I think\nThe spices the most people don't have the sitar\nWhich is based on while time but it's got lots of stuff in it I think is the most versatile useful spice blend in the world outside sesame seeds and boy Mac\nYeah ensue Mac would be another thing it's a Barry used to be used almost in place of lemon it's our but it's also lemony great on tomatoes you can use it on almost anything\n... seed not ground coriander is something most people don't have around I think is also really useful\nI'm going to put in a bid for a pet ... smokes pat pretty well ... that's really great also because for vegetarians you know when you can add bacon or smoked salmon or some sort of pork products you can add smoked ... had to give it a little bit of smoking and you can buy\nIndia to have these little kittens which have smaller tens in them for spices ... and you can buy one of those ... and you can keep in that ten sort of the whole purpose spices and spice one so for example\nAt breakfast I'll take the ten out and put some sitar and some pepper or something on it and you can dress up eggs you can dress up anything\nNext is pantry items I think teeny is literally a must yeah and me so she any by the way it goes gray with chocolate her race a yes absolutely mix it with Greek yogurt for ... for example or as the sandwich spread me so it was a great soup\nOut and put some sitar and some pepper or something on it and you can dress up eggs you can dress up anything\nNext is pantry items\nI think teeny is literally a must yeah in ... Cheney by the way it goes gray with chocolate her is a yes absolutely mix it with Greek yogurt for ... for example\nOr is the sandwich spread me so it was a great soup base white me so for chicken or the night so I have a fish when you're looking at\nAnd then my last suggestion would be pomegranate molasses which you can find almost everywhere it's our and it's sweet you can use it and I use it in a salad dressings just a little bit\nAny kind of dressing or you can drizzle it over meet after it's cooked\nOr ice cream or ice cream anywhere you use a good quality ball ... can you see a pomegranate molasses I also want to throw in a vote for ... mhm 'cause they provide a smoking is Anna wonderful heat\nTo other simple things if you buy whole human seed if you get a peppered writer putting coarse salt and then putting human seed\nSo instead of salt and pepper your had rice salt in human yeah and that is just for a general purpose way to improve your cooking you really can't beat that\nAnd then the last thing is that really big crystal like sea salt or Florida seller molten salt just to finish food or would that crunch\nAnd you get a lot of mileage off that that's a good start yeah okay that is a great start and one last thing if you want to be a little exotic by earth of pepper you are FA you have to bite on line it's a soft damp pepper in sort of flakes\nAnd its chocolate ... and rich is not too hot you know it goes on a lot of dishes just a few little tricks like that can make your cooking so much better so anyway that's our list\n[laughter] okay finally Don ... [laughter] exactly what I was looking\nThe little exotic by earth for pepper you are FA you have to bite on line it's a soft damp pepper in sort of flakes\nAnd its chocolate ... and rich is not too hot you know it goes on a lot of dishes just a few little tricks like that can make your cooking so much better so anyway that's your list [laughter]\nOkay I finally got the what I was looking out for me to look at it like\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you have a cooking question are we just want us to help you resolve a commentary arguments please give us a call at eight five five four to six Ninety four three the number once again is eight five five four to six Ninety four three or email us questions at ... radio dot com\nWalk in the mail street who's calling Hi my name is Kristen thanks for taking my call today pleasure out can we help you might get\nRange recently went out in nature type thing I got it bad for how much it would cost ... kitchen which can be about eight hundred and Seventy five dollars\nSo I'd like to know your opinion I never cut down a gaffe strange but I Know it generally preferred by professionals that knowing that extra cost I Would encourage half is luxury is it worth it well\nWhen we built out the ... street kitchens a couple of years ago for a variety of reasons we couldn't use all gas cook tops we had to use induction for many of them\nAnd I was not a fan of that but we did install induction it turns out induction\nWorks very well it heats up fast uh it's not any slower than gas I prefer dial you know and I like to see the gas but once you get used to the controls than it does a terrific job it's also safer because you're not going to burn yourself so I Know anyone ... Christmas you know an induction\nIs yet and that can add it cut ties\nAnd of that but we did in Seoul induction it turns out induction works very well it heats up fast uh it's not any slower than gas I prefer dial you know and I like to see the gas\nBut once you get used to the controls than it does a terrific job also safer because you're not going to blow yourself so I Know anyone ...\nChristmas you know an induction is yeah the neck net ... yes and the point is that it heats up the pan through magnetism through the metal\nIn the pan so that only the pan heat's not really the burner\nAnd it really hates it efficiently and you can get it high and get it low very quickly and here's the thing about induction you'll save money in the long run because it's the most energy efficient of all forms of heat and cooking 'cause the heat only goes into the pan\nGas is the least efficient cars that flames go out on the side that he goes out on the side it's not contained and electric is better than gas but induction hands down the bass so you'll probably save money and otherwise\nIt's just the one thing I Would walk out for is the controls 'cause I've used a bunch of these some of the controls you know used to be like in my day like in a car you'd have a radio which had a station control in volume yeah and I could figure it out but within doctored controls I mean it's like you have to hit the button three different buttons and you can be complicated she", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "07"}
