idiots and come back\nTo the physically I'm having issues with the issues that are in a restaurant there are smaller slightly sweeter and of course anchor the north American ... but they don't just color like red onions director long cooking\nAnd they're far less sweet than the daily as a ... so with onion forward wet curries like a ... or even something in the background like a butter chicken\nYou end up with a great career you if you attempt to you like ... or ... ... if you go with la la la ... or something like that or just something that's true sure of it usually is just too many onions you're using standard larger American yellow one\nLet me ask a question ... yellow onions are sharp when they're raw but in our testing it milk street we find they actually turn sweet [noise] do you find is just the amount of on you or do you find the yellow onions are still two overpowering when cooked\nA ... you know what it's a bit of both but you just end up with a completely different volume of onions solid\nI Know it's there is going to say so yeah he knows what I'm saying well how about ...\n... you know they are sweeter than a yellow Anya and but not playing Lee sweet\nI you know we tried to Charlotte it's just not the same the flavor is very different\nOr anyone cooked a ... you know what it's a bit of both but you just end up with a completely different volume of onions solid\nI Know it's there is going to say so yeah he knows what I'm saying well how about challenge\n'cause you know they are sweeter than a yellow onion but not cleanly sweet\nI you know we tried to show it's it's just not the same the flavor is a very different\nI mean if you're big complaint is volume I Would think just a yellow onion and to use less is the simplest thing\nI Would think getting the spices right using whole spices and posting them and doing all the things you should do will make much difference in whether we're using yellow or the pink onion right I mean that's really the crux of it hopefully next to you agree with that assessment\nI Would agree with that and you know as the sort of side bar here is also the total lack of availability of genuine Kashkari chili which ends up being introduced many of those careers where you need that given that color and everyone tries to approximate it with a kind of the past week or blunt that's what you\nCan

[laughter] but still exist recipes in hundreds of times I've done it many times you've done it but you went to Italy to see if there was something new or something that we don't know\nYeah you know it is such a simple dish and I guess that's what attracted me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have\nAn amazing amount of flavor and an hour max that they bring to the table and it didn't hurt that I learned it at this crazy winery that used to be owned by the mafia apparently the government took it away from the mafia and gave it to a retired stolen art inspectors are run in the meantime of course of course because it's the ...\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was really teach me basic rustic Sicilian cooking and this was one of the dishes she taught\nThe minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the richer Rome is a federal and Rosemary and garlic and it turns out that what she had done is frozen ... into a pot that had been soaked overnight\nFor in some wild I Know that she grabbed from the driveway of the winery a ton of Rosemary and garlic\nCook them away and when the beans were done to Austin some pasta started altogether and it was outrageously good for such a simple collection of ingredients to have such an amazing flavor profile there were layers of richness and ... and yet there was no dairy and\nSo why is this different than the eighty nine versions we've all been through your\nThink the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the basics here the beans are\nAnd when the beans were done tossed and some pasta started altogether and it was a ... good for such a simple collection of ingredients to have such an amazing flavor profile they were layers of richness and ... and yet there was no dairy in it\nSo why is this different than the eighty nine versions all been through a lot of years\nI think the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the beach here the beings are kind of like a starchy counter punch to the rich federal the rich Rosemary and the garlic I mean those are really the dominant flavors that you're getting and they're married and this kind of like ... starchy liquid from the beans and from the pasta itself\nAnd so the result is really rich and creamy an aromatic and again for such a simple group of ingredients it just has an amazing impact and flight\nSo I assume when we got back here did you make any alterations to the ... we\nDid we made a couple of first of all we simplified it for weeknight eve we use can beings and we were very happy with the results because in part the can't have that structure water you need to get the creamy sauce that we were looking for\nThe other thing we did was we found it was a little heavy and we wanted to lighten it up with that and I'd eaten the dishes second time ... and that turned the woman making it added some tomatoes which we live so we borrowed that to kind of bring a little bit of acidity to it\nAnd finally we felt that a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest also help tie everything together is like it and it also really played well with the Rosemary\n... like I say I'm you know a basic recipe but now authentic and a much more interesting yeah and also not very difficult very simple jammed thank you thank you you can find this recipe in all of our recipes one seven seven milk street dot com\nI'm Chris Kimball you're listening to milk street radio coming up to and passion forms an on air experiment demonstrating how sound effects taste we'll be right back\nA much more interesting yeah and also not very difficult ... jam thank you thank you you can find this recipe in all of our recipes one southern southern milk street dot com\nOn Chris Kimball you're listening to morning radio coming up their passion forms an on air experiment demonstrating how sound effects taste we'll be right back\nSupport for Christopher Campbell's milk street comes from Ferguson Ferguson bath kitchen and lighting gallery probably supports milk street corner ... everywhere bath kitchen and lighting collections in several styles available in store and online at ... dot com\nChristopher ... is ... by cp came media publisher of Tuesday nights a new cookbook with over two hundred quick recipes from all over the world milk street changed the way you cook visit us at one seven seven milk street dot com\nBoom\nYou're listening to milk street radio on K Jay Z thanks so much for tuning in we have more coming up with\nAnother mass shooting has shaken the country this time a gunman target worshippers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nThere's no place in America\nFor violence or anti Semitism we will\nBe broadcasting from Pittsburgh with all the latest on the shooting that next time on all things considered from NPR News\nComing up at four here on K.

I'm good enough lots to say but what percentage of sugar is the courts are\nUsually for five to seven percent of the powdered sugar staying with a shortening are fat I'm shooting for on fire\nLet's see uh the consideration but it's still sort of happens on some of them and I think it may have to do with reading them or like they dry out in the fridge I'm just not sure\nI was gonna say corn syrup that was my answers yeah ... I've got nothing left to say but what percentage of sugar is the corn syrup\nUsually for five to ten percent of the powdered sugar staying with a shortening are fat I'm shooting for around five and a sign that seems to help but after heating and cooling maybe that's causing the criminalization or you know the other things I can think of is like the doughnuts being too hot or the glazed ... when it goes on to the donut\nWhat do you do that you take that donuts out and play some right away or you let them cool a little usually\nLet them call like up to an hour or so before I get to them\nAnd then the glaze I'm trying to get as close to just warm as possible\nIn the industry when you research before you open the shop did they say to glazed doughnut sit there at a certain temperature to\nCool is what I've been reading and seeing from other industry folks I must say Reshef by trade so this is sort of new to me the whole construction side of things\nI Would think that if they cooled than you might have a more stable adherence between the clays in the doughnut 'cause if it's cooling ... steam coming off\nI don't know yeah I I Would try perfectly cool doughnuts and see if that helps\nYou know let me just rather than al ... um you know and I glazed doughnut just at home you know with a simple glaze in powdered sugar melts in LA usually I've been advised to let them call very slightly and to put the plays a role here warm\nYou know maybe try and very called because you've got a heated glaze the glaze I Do is not heated more try him right when they you know like four minutes five minutes out of the oven\nHave you found that it depends on the humidity\nSimple glaze of powdered sugar melts in Ella usually I've been advised to let them call very slightly and to put the plays a role here warm\nYou know maybe try and very cold because you've got a heated plays the glaze I Do is not heated more try him right when they you know like four minutes five minutes out of the oven\nHave you found that it depends on the humidity of the day or the temperature outside or is it ... absolutely\nSo can I come to your shop and get a discount on the ones with the ... so it may be maybe a guy well no maybe Sticky Fingers scout yeah moment Dickey finger maybe that's a I don't turn them into marketing plus yeah\nYeah there was not a bad idea [laughter]\nNo I Would try different temperatures and I would play with the percentage of corn syrup just double it and see if that makes a difference and done anything that hire you I was just doubled and see if that solves the problem because that would be an easy fix up food\nAnd want a donut yeah chase you did a good job they're hungry and good luck with that sounds great\nI Love the show on it it's great to talk to you guys and yet\nThey really care about I welcome to milk street who's on the line\nHi this is this level it how can we help you\n[noise] uh so I guess about a year ago I read the uh Giuliani who wrote that seminal book on Indian cooking\nHer description of how to capitalize on you and and it's different than the way I learned how to characterize onions which is to sweat the onion almost as soon as they get out of hand with salt sunny\nDoesn't mention that putting in Salt until like very ends and ever since then I've tried it both ways and I have basically not been able to the cameras on the incense\nYou mean that whole thing ... so you're onions don't care much any\nMore I got ...
