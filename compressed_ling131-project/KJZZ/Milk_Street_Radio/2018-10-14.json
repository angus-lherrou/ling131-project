amount not peanuts ah at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out these rumors started popping up that ah\nThere were in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is it the ... percenters is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of the ingredients were perfectly healthy wonderful things doesn't really matter [noise] well I think that is a\nBig question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was a\nChris go there was actually in the ... the factory formula [laughter] at the just plant it was up to twenty percent Crisco and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks\nDescribed it as it was a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream [laughter]\nJob side really doesn't hydrogenated fish boil doesn't sound like a great concept so the consumer reaction was fairly substantial 'cause you just tell us about it and how that happened and why does it happen and and how upset were people yeah well it all kind of\nComes down to this um one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of homemakers here's ... daughter Janet swap her\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts\nWere people yeah\nWell it all kind of comes down to this um one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of homemakers here's ... daughter Janet swap her\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and a ... children that are eating these peanut butter sandwiches mostly in here it's just painted flavored cream\nDesmond was a homemaker herself\nA very spirited very determined woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out what had happened and wanted to be feeding him healthy food\nThis was a time in American history where food was really transforming and it was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant\nA and so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice that mentioned that they were proposing a standardized definition for peanut butter\nAnd uh when she discovered that what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nA lot of this hydrogenated vegetable oil into\nThe jars of peanut butter that she was buying she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers\nA standardized definition for peanut butter and uh when she discovered that what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nA lot of this hydrogenated vegetable oil into\nThe jars of peanut butter that she was buying she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers and a flood of consumer comments started coming in to the FDA hundreds literally hundreds of letters here is Janet again\nHe said I Will tell everything I Will get all the facts and I will ... to everybody because everyone needs to be an informed\nSo she called herself on the ... and that's what she got and that's what was in our news letter you know telling people all the hearings and what was going on and the bills in Congress she put it in her newsletter and\nYou know I Love about this is that here in America vegetables and the games are kind of bland they were like the centerpiece or you have to do is look to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this is as good as eating effect it has a tremendous amount flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of tomato at the end I\nAdd those yellow split peas to the dish those are really thick and creamy you serve it over rice with a cucumber pickles and yogurt you can um as they do and vicious restaurant they add

go\nChris I'm ready to do this welcome to milk street who's calling Hi my name is Rachel Hi Rachel how can we help you today\nWell I think you know recipes on various websites and I ran across a recipe on a website I like a lot that sort of specializes in sort of healthy California style food\nThat called for ... powder and then when I looked at it it seems like it's cocoa powder but not roasted and I couldn't quite figure out\nWhat the differences in terms of taste mostly I mean I read up and I it's I guess people like they figure if it's kick how it has and then if they get killed off in the roasting process or something\nThat's right yeah Cal powders just cold press cocoa beans that are not roasted ... as opposed to Coco which is roasted beans that are turned to powder and of course the fattest removed as well\nI looked it up actually once someone said you have to use more Dutch process cocoa than Cal powder ... powder maybe stronger tasting but I don't I've never tested it I Would try one to one but I Would think the person who's going to be stronger flavor\nYeah I Would imagine okay not a good thing definitely yeah and I I mean I think I'll experiment with it just for fun oh and please get back to us we like to follow up\nOkay well I had a federal cap hotter and my Patrick ... so I Will make something that\nWe like that but uh so yeah I think I might I might get by\nWelcome to milk street who do we have on the line on the ground and Heineken Hi Brendan how can we help you today\nUm I got some green coffee beans from a friend of mine and I just want to do it I tried roasted um 'cause that's where I needed to do with it\nAnd that we liked that let us know yeah I ... I ... I get I\nWelcome the street who do we have on the line I'm Brendan Heineken Hi Brandon how can we help you today\nHi um I got some green coffee beans from a friend of mine and I just I tried roast 'cause that's where I needed to do with it really know what to do with either\nSo I tried to swirling around here for a while and uh they kind of started letting off these real paper ... scandals or if they you know and it's to go from green quite a bit hiring color to burn it yeah\nThat's what they do Chris you've done this now about ten years ago I went through this whole process because I Love coffee and uh I bought a number of different roasters sort of the the popcorn popper where the their air rated and they they go up in the air and swirl around\nI did the rotating drum roaster the more expensive one\nAnd here the problems first of all a lot of smoke so you have to do it underneath the hood of some ... ... New York city apartment secondly I found that every batch of beans had a different roasting time and temperature\nAnd so it's very complicated to get a roast right 'cause otherwise someone and burn and some of them are green and ... you know it's this problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than actually was worse than beans\nI could just buy at the last hour may play for like a so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right\nTo get the roasting the flavor right you know and the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time [noise]\nI never had much luck these things are expensive and there's a huge amount of smoke given off so I really ...\nOh wow wow we're may play for like a so I think the problem\nIs you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right to get the roasting the flavor right you know and the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time\nI never had much luck these things are expensive and there's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go to who gave I finally well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not grounds beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way to go well\nUnless brand any kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nUp on that kinda stuff I've only got a couple of pounds of these green beans I don't think it's worth it to go great opening to maybe do it just sort of like in a pan or something\nI did go on three or four hundred dollars and get around [laughter] and I gave up after a while and we found is second\nHand you know a popcorn popper you know to thrift store it might be worth it\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place there's like ten different kinds of beans and you can get really good deeds and make great coffee and the other thing I find is I like lighter roast like medium roast getting the ... the roast just write with these things is also a little tricky tricky so anyway\nThere you go ... thank you so much okay Brandon thanks for calling nice recalling already took their\nThis is mostly radio I'm your host Christopher Kimball please give us a ring the number is

can we help you today okay so\nUm you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook my one weakness I think is with desert\nThe one problem that I have with desert happened to deal with the frosting and the icing the decoration presentation all of that\nI Try a lot of recipes at home for my own crossing and I think but they never seem to work for the icing I Try that out or sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out right ... ... and then I tried to cream cheese one in the mix are also doesn't work\nWhat happens to the cream cheese one\nIt never really become spread out like I always even though I keep it at room temperature I always feel like it clumps up and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there so how can I make really good for us things and I think that at home\nI agree with you that the powdered sugar ice skating pretty ... yeah I really don't you can add like orange juice to anything but I I don't orange that idea they never turn out now I don't like him a chocolate crossing always worst nicely because of the chocolate cools it sets up\nI'd like an Italian Moran or whispering which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup\nLike at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much\nAnd then you drizzle it on the egg whites as beating them and the mixer for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so it's not that hard to do but you have another no I was just going to say the Boyles\nUh and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup like at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much and then you drizzle it on the egg white says for beating them in the mix her for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting that will hold nicely ... a day or so it's not that hard to do but you have another\nNo I was just going to say the boiled frosting which is sort of similar involves egg white friend out what just sugar water egg whites in LA and craft harder but the thing about the Italian see you added sugar served the egg whites there's also the Swiss where you heat up the sugar in egg whites in red hook it to about one sixth day\nThose are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for crossing I assume\nI mean that's what I Would prefer to start that way I can kind of build up my confidence and start working with something a little bit more than\nI think the cream cheese frosting though that's going to give you a good texture and that's going to hold really well too\nAnd I wonder if maybe that's more technique issue with me and not maybe really knowing how to work with my next or\nDo you have a hand mixer or stand mixer\nA stand mixer\nAnd what happened you said it was just the text you was to stiffer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Phoenix", "day":
