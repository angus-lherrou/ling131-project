complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be if Saudi has proven to have been behind us he\nDid not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action\nBut he said that that is not a what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take\nStrong action and he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi

the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world for resources to the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lumps don't show\nThem I'm social filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world was with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export markets a nice little extra\nOr if it's if Katie's the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably global sales have been out\nHow global business is this\nMore and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're you're probably are global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact that you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over since\nI'm distorted a sealer but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to outpaced their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements they well an apt in the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that looked like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell we don't like the options on the table\nThis is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attack is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs you consumer and hopefully you have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different\nWays out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as the state that voted for president today has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nDrinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as a state that voted for president today has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nOr [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of\nCollateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much uh it come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean\nCongressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he\nWill note for the non geographically minded right across the\nRiver yes ah in in he he told us he understood exactly that this would this mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that that's a federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike you know holy David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that would bar but you've got to make it here in America if you want to sell you better make and Kentucky\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nI think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and and from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher prices maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose\nBetter make the beginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequence is one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or they'd be converted a blast for years\nSuddenly if they start looking in my standpoint if the bourbon is higher price\nMaybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations\nBeret Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable

supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damage is upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything back to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you have a one year you're talking to people that houses have

the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across the floor\nThat will greatly affect the ruins of for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove

affect their willingness for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCancer things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be a bowling because look if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans and what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him the Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consists\nWhiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party former house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval of course he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding dull\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News this is MORNING EDITION on cages easy keeping you

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nNo coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection\nAnd whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's cry sources at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lump sum shelf\n... filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnnoyed if Katie's the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're probably your global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic failed while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yet they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements that well a nap to any you agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat\nWill very concerned um a lot of the big players are we're able\nI Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the

about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell uh we don't like the options on the table\nThis is the twenty five percent tax increase tears were taxes no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people that you've converting from\nScotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nStayed in the obvious as a state that voted for president today has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you um ... again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon me\nYou stand wild you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you um ... again I haven't heard much ah it come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean\nCongressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what Barbie means you can Jackie or he will note for the non\nGeographically minded right across the river yes ah in in he he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike your Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better make the beginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been a I think that's when you\nCan start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him

drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's great sources to the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lumps don't show\nThem I'm social filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world was with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export markets a nice little extra\nOh it it it gives you the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably global sales have been out facing your domestic sales\nThis is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact that you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the store to the sealer but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to outpaced their domestic sales in the past Fifteen or Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nap to any you agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that looked like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell we don't like the options on the table\nThis is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attack is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people did give converted from scotch do remain bourbon drinkers um or you take your profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different\nWays out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as the state that voted for president today has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all know\nYour profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious this is a state that voted for president today has voted for Republicans a lot that ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you um ... again I haven't heard much ah it come up as an\nIssue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSet up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what perjury means Kentucky or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah\nIn in he told us he understood exactly that this would this district mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that that's a federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike your Harley Davidson which announced they can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in America and if you want to sell it you better make in Kentucky beginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and and from a price standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher prices maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people far industry and\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\n... yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or they'd be converted a blast for years sadly if they started looking and from my standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose for generations beret\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week
