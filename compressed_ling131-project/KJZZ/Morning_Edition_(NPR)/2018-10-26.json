also think you can't divorce it from the fact that Megan Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News you just play some popular collies\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her

comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white and she says it was a white man to tell\nUs about her history of making racialized comments\nWell these aren't uh the only examples of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously uh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective ... on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of a

with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's collie an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor yeah uh uh of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect us starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments safe something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which

founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDoors are as as a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bomb or business surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list or you know progressive leaders they wants to retire\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on this I think he is the single most important known politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us\nUm if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wants to attack and I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important normal politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen fifty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his

London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened\nOne of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trade and so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties nineties\nTell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\nWell I'm In the nineties the specialty whereas a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark\nAnd when forest is right or the pound collapse or us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into chaos\nWhen

particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to is it just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expanding Russian and he

that appears to be connected to the suspect in federal custody a lot of manpower has been deployed nationwide do the postal inspectors\nThe FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives have been on the case as well as local police I'm\nIn the Miami Dade County area and also of course the New York city police department to\nAnd there's also some ongoing activity in Virginia right yes

looking for clues for\nHow the bombs were constructed and they've also been looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind no word yet on whether anything they found in that analysis has helped lead them to the suspect in South Florida\nOh that's interesting we'll have to wait and see I suppose so I mean one notable thing this whole time is that none of these bombs that actually exploded and so there's been some speculation that maybe they couldn't explode they didn't have the capacity what investigators said about that theory\nOn their record police sources and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether the these bombs couldn't presented a lethal threat to anyone\nOn background overnight and earlier this morning I was hearing a law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that some former bomb analysts at the ATF have raised questions about whether these devices included a key component that would have set them off that would have detonated them it appeared\nFrom the photos that were made public that perhaps these devices lacked that key component\nBut nonetheless police had been advising folks as I had the FBI to be very careful when they were looking at any manila envelopes or any suspicious packages because uh they needed to be considered a potential threat\nAnd they law enforcement right now even is advising people to call authorities call police called the FBI facing anything suspicious now we know that the New York police commissioner James O'Neill said last last afternoon

or any material like that\nBut that authorities were still treating all of these parcels as potentially dangerous and the analysis may not be done yet as to what's and all of these uh these bombs potential lumps so law enforcement officials still have a long way to go here\nAnd PR is justice correspondent Carrie Johnson Carrie thank you so much for the update my pleasure [noise]
