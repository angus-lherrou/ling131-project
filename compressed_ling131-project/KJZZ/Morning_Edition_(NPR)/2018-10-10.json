Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon so brutal ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurdens and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is

an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I
