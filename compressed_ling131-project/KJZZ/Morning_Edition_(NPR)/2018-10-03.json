it'd be so what about it but these are not our is that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing to

not gonna do it verbatim translate oh no I don't know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you could you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel are ...

hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question my name is Melissa ...\nAren't there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and government work hike okay Hi see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations that residents of center the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have any means that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they'd been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status if you use Mac\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary\nThis is Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because it illegally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely or the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted him off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons and that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my her from birth still Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIf so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots of judicial plans and various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit both\nUh they've been talk of an Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in

that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right that enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an

know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process I mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster\nAnd you could you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable

court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work by Cokie Hi fi here's our first question\nName is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested\nA very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics or the government work hike okay Hi Steve here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations that presidents have sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they'd been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice aid for deceptive chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justice is through impeachment just like the president only one justice\nWas drawn because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justice is through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off to quit because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John round off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\n'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons and that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my her from ... Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIf so what was the result of what is it what these lifetime appointments well lots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age them both\nUh they've been talk of Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a changing the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much thank you Steve commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and government work by tweeting us with the hashtag askcokie [noise]\n... ... ... a year for a preview of what's coming up on the show good morning work he feel good morning for Arizona attorney general grant woods has been making noise about switching parties from Republican to Democrat in order to run for US Senate in a couple of years coming up we'll find out how\nQuestions about our politics and government work by tweeting us with the hashtag askcokie [noise]\nBanned from ask Cokie to ask ... kj as easy as mark Brody here for a preview of what's coming up on the show good buddy mark\nA feel good morning for Arizona attorney general grant woods has been making noise about switching parties from Republican to Democrat in order to run for US Senate in a couple of years coming up we'll find out how successful are candidates who move from one political party to another will also find out how in an underground punk rock movement helped lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall\nThat in the latest news in ten minutes\nLike ... and they check of ... forty nine yesterday was one of the rainiest days ever recorded in the state leading to school closures flooded roads and even some water rescues the rain close some schools in Phoenix Avondale in paradise valley including all of the miracle of community colleges\nPhoenix firefighters were involved in the rescue of several motorists to stranded after trying to drive through areas of high water mark O'Malley is meteorologist with the national weather service in Phoenix he says humid air is leftover moisture from tropical storm Russia and another weather system moving down from California could bring some additional rain", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "03"}
