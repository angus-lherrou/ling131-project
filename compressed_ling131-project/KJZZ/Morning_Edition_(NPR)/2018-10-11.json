Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the

he's been saying about the north Korea and Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier are presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi
