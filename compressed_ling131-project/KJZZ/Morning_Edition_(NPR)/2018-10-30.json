in our lives that could shape how we vote on November six maybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child\nOver the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring his conversations about personal questions or anxieties that shaped election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida is about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's recovers\nElection decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida is about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Margot\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's her conversation with rich more\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me\nI first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied\nBut it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going by per se you know a lot you know as I was reading in bad you know it was very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on was there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away no this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're ... and his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just\nGoing full bore so he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nI had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want\nRight yes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planted a seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now\nIt's it's it's a process [noise]\nIt's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours where you and your son have endured this but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience\nIt's it's it's a process [noise]\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers\nCan effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours where you and your son have endured this [noise] but as you think about voting how would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it\nAnd why did my son has to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not right now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need\nTo make it through the day sometimes are you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\n[noise] actually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change and I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is that state to state so different why is there help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat and to me I really don't\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why is or help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cause and I want to fix this problem\nThat means Isabel your your whoever won once president from especially wants to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\nOh I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord\nIt's like if she would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants what's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas [noise]\nLesley all just close by asking you how things are between\nYou and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nAs strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I've got us back to my last\nGood he's trying to do in other areas [noise] fluffy I'll just closed by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how was your relationship\nIt's a strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I got his back till my last breath\nIs about thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there to Isabel Simon\nAnd this is NPR News\n... hours after eleven people were killed in a Pittsburgh synagogue President Trump held a campaign rally\nWeekends led evil change our life and change our schedule he\nIs changing his scheduled to be in Pittsburgh today but not everyone wants them there and I'm Ari Shapiro reaction to the president's trip this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the AC a very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there's talk and voted for that though\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by a Republican incumbent Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold ... government control your health care ending Medicare as we know it still blink taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine a and attacked me and say I'm some you know not\nHas repeatedly asserted he will not vote for ... for speaker saying it's time for new leadership\nBeing in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine and attacked me and say I'm ...

term send you cannot get away from those negative political ads this year here in Arizona\nArizona's race for the U.S Senate has made national headlines were how close it is and how negative is\nJay Jay is easy spread jasper's reports on why we're seeing all this nastiness\nOf the most notorious ads shows democratic representative cures didn't send them out wearing a pink two two and protesting the Iraq War you've probably seen it cinemas opponent for the Senate Republican Martha make Sally launched the ad before the primary was even over here\nOh negative get is ... reports on why we're seeing all this nastiness\nOne of the most notorious ads shows democratic representative cures didn't send them out wearing a pink two two and protesting the Iraq War you've probably seen it cinemas opponent for the Senate Republican Martha mix Sally launched the ad before the primary was even over here's make Sally at a rally last month at a GOP office in Sun City\nYou know I'm running against somebody who spent time organizing protests and protesting are cheap and if you do you see that I write\nCinema has said she was protesting the war and not the troops and there's a big difference between those things the ad was rated mostly false by politifact button mix Sally has made no apologies for the tone of the campaign\nSome people ask me like hey you know ... you know wiping up a negative I can add it to public service you\nMix Sally has said she had to go negative sense cinema was up on TV early defining herself as a moderate and ignoring her past as a progressive state lawmaker there and Henry a registered Democrat heard mix Sally defend the decision on the radio and it turned him off\nI mean how you run your race Mitt come out to people why you want them to vote for you and what you plan on doing not hey I think this person is doing this and all the negative publicity over here I don't like this\nLike a lot of Democrats cinema has tried to steer the conversation repeatedly toward healthcare and seismic Sally is attacking her to avoid that topic\nIt looks like Mica has continued to do what she's doing during the campaign which is a lot of negative and Paul attacks against me to avoid talking about record which hurt Arizona but cinema and her allies have run\nNegative ads to want to add co sponsored by a liberal veterans advocacy group and a democratic nonprofit accused make Sally of betraying better\nHer to avoid that topic it looks like Martha has continued to do what she's doing during the campaign which is a lot of negative and father tax against me to avoid talking about her own record which hurts Arizona but cinema and her allies have run\nSome negative ads to one ad co sponsored by a liberal veterans advocacy group and a democratic nonprofit accused mix Sally of betraying veterans because of her vote on health care plenty of cinema ads have said Mick Sally voted to repeal protections for pre existing conditions although the details are more complicated than that\nKim ... is a professor at ASU who studies negative campaigning Senate races and women in politics she says different negative ads have different effects\nSo if you're talking about an issue like health care and you're criticizing your opponent but you're not doing it in an overly straightened manner that could help 'em depress evaluations of your opponent so in that case it makes sense to go negative\nIt makes sense if the ad is relevant but other negative messages are irrelevant and on civil for ... says they use harsh language and scary music for research with a colleague suggest irrelevant and uncivil ads may not affect what a voter thinks about a candidate but it could change that voters behavior\nWe do find that if there's lots of ads that are irrelevant and uncivil that means you know it's overly negative and there are a lot of those that we find that that actually these people to disengage and maybe not turn out to vote\nCase in point of Peoria woman I met in a target parking lot in Glendale she wouldn't give me her name because her son's in the military and she said he wouldn't like that she definitely doesn't like the ads in the Senate campaign\nGod those ads are horrible absolutely horrible\nThere's a lot of them yes there are and I drive you know two hours every day on my commute and I hear I Can't tell you how many ads and\nOut to the case in point of Peoria woman I met in a target parking lot in Glendale she wouldn't give me her name because her son's in the military and she said he wouldn't like that she definitely doesn't like the ads in the Senate campaign\nMy God those ads are horrible absolutely horrible\nIt was a lot of them yes there are and I drive you know two hours every day I'm like me and I hear I Can't tell you how many ads and honestly it reminds me as petty school ground catty girls just going at each other so I just\nPrefer to distance myself from that so you might not vote in that race because of that track\nThis woman didn't vote in the twenties sixteen presidential race for the same reason for kids says certain voters are more likely to be turned off from the negativity and not vote\nIt does depressed turnout among people who are less interested among women among independents and so that would definitely heard Democrats more than Republicans\nFritz ... doesn't know if depressing democratic turnout is a strategy of mix Sally is what is clear is that Arizona Senate race has seen some of the highest spending in the country including ad spending and this in an era when so many voters don't need to be persuaded at all people like registered Republican Michael ... of Glendale\nI'd like the direction of where this country's going right now so for me anybody that does

heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're while taking his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executor except that uh the state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just\nGoing full bore so he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nYes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street\nWas homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody it was the lowest point\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street\nHe was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planted a seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds\nHe looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now it's it's it's a process\n[noise] so it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours were you and your son have endured this but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there\nBut not everyone can afford it and why did my son has to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know\nEndured this but as you think about voting how would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it\nAnd why did my son I have to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not right now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need\nTo make it through the day sometimes are you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change\nAnd I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why is or help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means Isabel your your who everyone wants president from especially wants to keep your vote or with the ...\nRams are people need health care drug counseling who will support that and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cause and I want to fix this problem\nThat means Isabel your your whoever won once president from especially wants to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\n[noise] I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now in all the discord\nIs like if she would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for\nHe wants it's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves but to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas [noise]\nLesley all just close by asking you how things are\nBetween you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nIt's as strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I've got us back to my last breath\nVisible thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there too is a bill Simon\nMy son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I thought his back killed my last breath miss about thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there to Isabel Simon\nAnd this is NPR News\nAnd this is MORNING EDITION of the perfect mix of BBC NPR and kj seizing news this Tuesday October thirtieth\nTwenty Eighteen welcome to good morning I'm Phil Latzman Arizona's televisions computers in radios are awash with ads for and against prop one twenty seven we'll explore the arguments on both sides want the actual impact of this\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen the [noise]\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the AC a very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that we're talking voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by Republican incumbent Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical global at government control your health care and Medicare as we know it still blink taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term and that's the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine a and attacked me and say I'm ...
