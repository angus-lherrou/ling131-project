educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're my lawyer tells stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her biggest dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's up more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its ... an incredible ability to connect with those who crude commit money or resources to their mission\nOn I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present a story but will really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually\nFrom other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media and about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is Katie my other why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started up a charity first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management gets you\nKnow in ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\nCan you explain\nChild soldier um and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\nCan you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my other and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we asked the and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lawyer had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year in twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial\nThe charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated but\nI think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points that organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia is still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on and the government has not just a a full investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we heard what's our process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed in the school\nThat was certainly young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down a CEO of more than me this is NPR News

continued her relationship with the country and she started up a charity first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management gets you\nKnow in ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\nCan you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nWas heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his scope of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous

... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his scope of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what\nHe was doing well that's something that we ask ... and something that we've reported our responses in that piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to this story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formulated revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and the organizations internal documents\nWas

formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outline in that piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if\nHer organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the city is that it has been a net positive for the girls of Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling this story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse with an institution and any other context\nIn Liberia is still a lousy organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community the sense of a lot of people had a feeling that

I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King\nMore than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're my lawyer tells stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her biggest dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's up more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its undercut the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who crude commit money or resources to their mission\nOn I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present a story but will really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but to a small step\nBeginning I think that more than me and particularly its ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media and about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is Katie my other why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started up a charity first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management gets you\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls that he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my other and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with him but she conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nOn as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in the court those who actually were willing to bring a case they were retested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if\nFor organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership that there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other country\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership that there
