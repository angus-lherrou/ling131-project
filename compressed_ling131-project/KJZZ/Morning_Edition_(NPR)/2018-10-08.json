MORNING EDITION\nArizona is in the midst of critical negotiations over water\nThe Colorado River ... quite possibly be in shortage in twenty twenty to enter in agreement with the other river basin states powerful groups within Arizona need to figure out who gets caught and how and joining us now from worries cages easiest Brett jasper's hate Brad hey\nSo shortage in this context means the lake dipped below a certain level\nYeah and at different levels different cuts kick in so at the last public meeting on this a group of eight grade students attended and they asked some good basic questions about what's going on one question tried to get at this idea of who gets cut off for limited and times of shortage\nAnd here's how Ted cook answered that he's the general manager of the agency that runs the central Arizona project\nKnow what the answer to that is that sometimes we don't live with the answer is that these people get cut fruits or those people get cut first then those people get caught that's why we're all meeting here is to see if there was a way to agree to to still respect in how the priorities work um\nLimited in times of shortage and here's how Ted cook answered that he's the general manager of the agency that runs the central Arizona project\nWe know what the answer to that is but sometimes we don't like what the answer is\nThat these people get cut fruits or those people get cut first then those people get caught that's why we're all meeting here is to see if there was a way to agree to to still respecting how the priorities work\nI'm a ... agreement among ourselves that um the outcome might be different than just kind of the default outcome of what the priorities dictate\nSounds like this could be a big change in how water is divvied up it could be to understand where at least two groups are coming from I went to two places I water treatment plant in North Phoenix\nAnd a farm in ... county\nTomorrow we'll visit Phoenix but now I'm Kelly Anderson's farm in ... county near the city of Maricopa\nAny irrigation ditch flowing\nIn fact I grew up in that house right there [noise]\nI knew from day one what I wanted to do\nAnderson now grows decorative we millet for craft stores like Hobby Lobby he also grows regular wheat and leases fields to alfalfa farmers he's part of an irrigation\nDistrict that along with others is slated to lose all of its Colorado River water during shortage under a proposed drought contingency plan the good ties with the\nCap waters is over we're going back to where it was back in the seventies and you have to go back to that frame of mind that type of management of your farm uh to think about you know we're on groundwater in limited\nAnderson knew he'd have to fully returned to groundwater by twenty thirty but the ... now farmers thought they'd have some river water until then like meat has fallen faster than the state's expected which is why a new plan is needed but it threatens to make the cut off for ... county farmers are much more sudden\nThey're fighting to keep some river water to help them adjust it would give us\nA ... a longer period of time to work on well\nAnderson knew he'd have to fully returned to groundwater by twenty thirty but the canal farmers thought they'd have some river water until then Lake Mead has fallen faster than the state's expected which is why a new plan is needed but it threatens to make the cut off for canal county farmers much more sudden\nThey're fighting to keep some river water to help them adjust it would have given us a ... a longer\nPeriod of time to work on wells to to budget some capital improvements and bonding to to help with ah with those types of projects um that was that was the thinking this just with the drought is just relax instead of just really brought things to the forefront much much quicker\nThere's a reason why farmers in ... county are towards the back of the line when it comes to doling out river water in the early two thousand they swapped more secure rights for a lower priority\nThis water was subject to availability and would be phased out by twenty thirty\nIt helps cities and the federal government settled Native American water claims in return the farmers got over a hundred and sixty million dollars in debt relief and cheaper water prices fall or um has represented in our county irrigation districts for years he says when they made earlier deals circumstances were different\nWe didn't have anything on the horizon like what we're face what we're facing now and um I think most folks who are objective in this process say you know there should be a share the pain kind of situation and we're taking the big headed the pain up front\nBut if the rules for pain and priorities are set hasn't that's already been decided shame Leonard is the general manager of the Roosevelt water conservation district which serves farmers and residents in Maricopa County he says there are concerns over the economic impact of canal county farmers losing their river water but there's also politics\nAt the end of the day the reason why we're talking about it is because everybody recognizes the reality of\nThe rules for pain and priorities are set hasn't that's already been decided Shane Leonard is a general manager of the Roosevelt water conservation district which serves farmers and residents in Maricopa County he says there are concerns over the economic impact of canal county farmers losing their river water but there's also politics\nBut at the end of the day the reason why we're talking about it is because everybody recognizes the reality of there are going to be some very key folks down to the legislature that want to know that we at least tried to mitigate some of ... counties issues\nAnd Phil several different groups say some version of this in our county and other lower priority groups like home builders have support in the legislature and that's why we're talking about easing them off Colorado River water\nSo breakfast the legislature have to sign off on the drought contingency plan\nYeah ultimately lawmakers have to give the state the authority to sign on the dotted line with the other ... states but Paul or um the attorney for now farmers that we heard from says their support is only as strong as the case for fairness they can make and

states powerful groups within Arizona need to figure out who gets caught and how and joining us now from war is Kay Jay's easiest Brett jasper's hate Brad hey\nSo shortage in this context means the lake dipped below a certain level\nYeah and at different levels different cuts kick in so at the last public meeting on this a group of eight grade students attended and they asked some good basic questions about what's going on one question tried to get at this idea of who gets cut off for limited in times of shortage\nAnd here's how Ted cook answered that he's the general manager of the agency that runs the central Arizona project\nWe know what the answer to that is but sometimes we don't life was the answer is\nThat these people get cut first of those people get cut first then those people get caught that's why we're all meeting here is to see if there was a way to agree to to still respecting how their priorities work\nUm make agreements among ourselves that um the outcome might be different than just kind of the default outcome of what the priorities dictate\nIt sounds like this could be a big change in how water is divvied up\nIt could be to understand where at least two

type of management of your farm or to think about you know we're on groundwater in limited\nAnderson knew he'd have to fully returned to groundwater by twenty thirty but the now farmers thought they'd have some river water until then like meat has fallen faster than the state's expected which is why a new plan is needed but it threatens to make the cut off for ... county farmers are much more sudden\nThey're fighting to keep some river water to help them adjust\nIt would have given us a ... a longer period of time to work on wells to to budget some capital improvements some bonding to to help with ah with those types of projects [noise] um that was that was the thinking this just with the drought is just relax instead of just really brought things to the forefront much much quicker\nA reason why farmers in ... county are towards the back of the line when it comes to doling out river water in the early to thousands they swapped more secure rights for a lower priority\nThis water was

earlier deals circumstances were different\nWe didn't have anything on the horizon like what we're face what we're facing now and um I think most folks who are objective in this process say you know there should be a share the pain kind of situation and we're taking the big headed the pain up front\nBut if the rules for pain and priorities are set hasn't that's already been decided shame Leonard is the general manager of the Roosevelt water conservation district which serves farmers and residents in Maricopa County he says there are concerns over the economic impact up in our county farmers losing their river water but there's also politics\nBut at the end of the day the reason why we're talking about it is because everybody recognizes the reality of there are going to be some very key folks down to the legislature that want to know that we at least tried to mitigate some of ... counties issues\nAnd Phil several different groups say some version of this canal county and other lower priority groups like home builders have support in the legislature and that's why we're talking about easing them off Colorado River water so\nPurchased the legislature have to sign off on the drought
