but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they were elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence and drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress and other legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder notes that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence\nNational coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others they will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty what is the problem that you're trying to address what\nWe're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nHow are you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nNot only do criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one\n[noise] no I don't think I Would criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen\nThe governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and we will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team will be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so\nThe impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matters when North Carolina we're supporting and eat or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nYou campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea

will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitutions as a as they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ensure a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what your wrist off a famous remark by Michelle Obama windy\nLow [noise] they go low\nWe you know what did you mean or what I meant ... ... ... in that remark was that ah I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate [noise] [noise]\nI certainly think votes through protests um I I just say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going act

state's highest court\nCages easiest Will Stone brings us part three in our series\nAlex lane jokes he went from attorney to narco traffic her overnight wealth of the cave free Canada's come on it and it's not because of the giant jars of marijuana on display at his dispenser either it's things like\nChocolate covered blueberries olive oil car mills\nThese popular products sold throughout the state contain cannabis extracts which are made from the resident of the plant and they're now effectively illegal lane a criminal defense attorney and a former prosecutor sums it up this way\nIt would be like saying that you're allowed to purchase the orange and you're allowed to consume the orange juice inside the orange however if you take the same orange and you squeeze it into a glass\nOil for males\nThese popular products sold throughout the state contain cannabis extracts which are made from the resident of the plant and they are now effectively illegal lane a criminal defense attorney and a former prosecutor sums it up this way\nIt would be like saying that you're allowed to purchase the orange and you're allowed to consume the orange juice inside the orange however if you take the same orange and you squeeze it into a glass and drink the Jews you've now committed a felony\nThis isn't hyperbole that's ever since the Arizona court of appeals upheld the conviction of a man named Rodney Jones a medical marijuana card holder Jones was sentenced to prison after being arrested in northern Arizona with Canada's oil that he picked up from a dispensary\nThe ruling found Arizona's medical marijuana law doesn't allow for extracts only the flour and that has huge implications it means many of the state's one hundred and eighty thousand patients not to mention the dispensary owners like lane are committing felonies\nI think it's absolutely unfair that one patient gets singled out and prosecuted\nShortly after the ruling lane even wrote the court a letter citing previous rulings that he says prove extracts are already legal and that he uses and sells these very products\nEven though it was unusual I I guess unprecedented for anybody to come into a criminal case I felt that it was warranted inappropriate if the lawyers willing to offer a confession to the exact conduct the other guy just went to prison for that I should have been granted stand eighty to intervene\nHis request was denied now it's up to the Arizona Supreme Court the state health department hasn't told dispensaries to stop carrying anything with extracts but the agency did cite the

case when it rejected autism as a qualifying conditions for medical marijuana\nAt least one prosecutor is happy with the ruling Sheila ... pi county attorney and her office brought the case against Rodney Jones\nThis case affirmed away cannabis has always been treated in this county by my office which is that it's a narcotic drug\nArizona's medical marijuana act passed by voters in twenty ten doesn't explicitly mentioned canvas extracts but the criminal code does and that means patients who use the products are committing felonies the\nRule of law is the tele courts have the final word the Jones decision is simple and it's clear\nSo is poke rating dispensaries it doesn't appear so\nI personally have never visited a dispensary and and yeah by county I don't know what I mean the Tories\nBut patients are still at risk a prosecutor recently re filed charges in Navajo county against one medical marijuana card holder citing the Jones decision\nThe Maricopa County attorney's office says it's not prosecuting anyone yet one reason for that is Jennifer wealth and she and her husband went to court five years ago so they could give their young son Zander cannabis extracts for

don't understand how it works doesn't mean it doesn't work does it mean that we shouldn't have access to it\nThe appeals court decision though takes precedence until the Supreme Court weighs in\nArizona is a cautionary tale about the possible fallout of using the ballot instead of state legislators to craft marijuana reform law's says Rob Mike as he's a law professor at Vanderbilt University and says these measures aren't always comprehensive you're opening the door\nTo those opponents to sort of revisit the issue and exploit those gas\nMichigan for example only clarified in twenty sixteen what was legal in their state years after voters passed their medical marijuana measure might go says many lawmakers don't want to get ahead of these disputes\nWay to practice problem these gaps between the the letter and spirit of the marijuana reforms is to have them addressed first and foremost by legislatures that know how to write legislation that anticipate all those problems that might come up\nThat did not happen in Arizona in fact a bill aimed at fixing the problem earlier this year never got a hearing Will Stone kj ...
