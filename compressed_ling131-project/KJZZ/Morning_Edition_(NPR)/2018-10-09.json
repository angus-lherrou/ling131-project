tempted issue or red notice that's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists leaders are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over

he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nA shortage blow to the judge what happened and they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison where Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national\nLegal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that it alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nBefore the

nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my client stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a tradeoff that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR News I'm Lee gains in
