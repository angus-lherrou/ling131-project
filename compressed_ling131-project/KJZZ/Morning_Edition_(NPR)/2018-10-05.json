seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which is not normal um there are barricades set up and there are more police year than I have seen president I'm from just about any voted any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about in American politics for the past year or so that seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners\nThe capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which is not normal um there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president I'm from just about any voted any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we've talked about in American politics for the past year or so\nThere seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they pass an essay but they'll they they are doing those basic pieces of governance but\nAs soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on pushing it if they can continue to do that or if these fights towers them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colored Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington ... so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I think Diane Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nAnd we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate votes could stretch out for a half\nHour or more a before then we're going to hear from Fort key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford\nFor many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said she was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want uh\nFeinstein will speak next she's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years and somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I remember I remember that I had a vaguely remembered something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of attention within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race from mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling or under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be hurt and\nGo back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up\nUnder siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of that\nAssault even under the lowest standard approve she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this cases even weaker than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to wreak\nCorroborate them for the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standards and the quote so\nWe have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background in addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation that we received\nAre more than twenty committee staff members have work night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there\nLast many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations in the FBI confirm what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by a judge Kavanaugh and ... the Judiciary Committee or the FBI\nCould locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations there also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever\nBeing good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition to judge Kavanaugh

seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us the Democratic strategy used against a Kevin ... has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair answer all the process is\nThirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork or playbook remains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become\nSort of listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh as being ... which is the way the conservatives refer to this neither Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert books nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how ... fared and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interests did have some ads against him and they were a chump

degrees seven o'clock\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nThere are four key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe mansion we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend grapevine I'll say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close they are going to guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior member senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\nBack\nUp okay we're gonna try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear or in their entire already over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had the other senator we'll hear from\nIs the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch to confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and\nAbsolutely central to the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation\nIt as Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes needed Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their sides\nAt but don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for the\nUh matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated was a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can and let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in ...\nBut but he is there a guy he's they're pointing that\nHe's been Marshall and the Democratic troops to the extent that they can now let's get a sense of the scene is we're wait their speeches because Brecht and book are NPR's ... Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days in Brockton what's the scene like this morning\nWell Steve there are some ... crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing off to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away [noise] ah they have had a number of people come up and share their stories [noise] a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults ... trauma and the sharing the story basically saying\nWe cannot put a a Supreme Court you cannot elevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime\nRight they have been found and what what they're saying she had said one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country and the last several days [noise] as well we'll talk about that a little bit ... mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor look listen to the Senate minority leader\n... chapters in the long history of the federal judicial carry the well with poison from the outset when President Trump selected judge Cavanaugh\nFrom the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest ... trifling concern\nCompared to repealing ... Wade cutting people's health care and achieving apart as in majority on the Supreme Court the rock worst and\nWhen the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge cabin was records from the public\nDiscarding decades and bipartisan precedent\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court the rock worsened\nWhen the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nDiscarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd flooding norms of transparency and fairness and finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault in high school in twenty Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a break away members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nInvestigation which was then severely circumstance cry by the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay knowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nKnowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf wind nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could move this nominee two weeks ago or one week ago Democrats had nothing no say and don't\nWhen it comes to who comes to the floor but in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward when it comes to complaining about delaying\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips\nMerrick Garland Republicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction\nWith this nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman because what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience there\nAnd our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford and her deeply held memories of what happened to work of a smear campaign are they choosing Dr Ford of a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction\nBecause that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony\nAnd then trying to blame Democrats I don't blame them\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work of a smear campaign are they using Dr Ford of a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony\nAnd then trying to blame Democrats I don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when\nFuture Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nHas this shameful combination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America\nPeople who will stop at nothing to entrench in advantage on our nation's courts let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many years and a bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination\nEvery one of us will go on record was one of the most consequential votes you ever cast\nIn the Senate\nNow the stakes are always hot for U.S Supreme court nomination but colleagues the extraordinary events of recent weeks have raised them even higher this time\nWhen we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly well qualified judge show our highest court\nNot anymore not after all this United States Senate will also be making a say within the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirmed that in the United states of America\nEvery one is innocent\nUntil proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal\nWithin the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirm that in the United states of America everyone is innocent until proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack and the Senate case\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body will either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy on Americans live or will declare\nThat our society cannot must not will not set the bar so\nLow\nSo madam president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long or on full display\nLet's get back in ... through the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people had been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice judge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that just nominate\nWe're on full display so let's sit back and sample a few of the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people had been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks\nThey're very nice judge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice where are the junior senator from Oregon to declare that this nominee would pave the way they're tearing it his audience crowds of\nFar left protestors still filling out in the blanks on their tickets on there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against it\nMore recently we've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy met\nAnd I'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's where I'm a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties\nFinished their due process\n\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen days\nThat was incredibly enlightening\nInnocent jokes beer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nAt play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh classmate southern straight earlier this week she'll stop and consider the snapshot\nThe absurdity the absurdity the indebtedness it\nThis is our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice this is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this\nProcess would be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMirror hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was awesome\nI'm a nation colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend\nThe Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\n\nIt was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means\nNecessary it was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nAnd so called resistance until the final vote was called for a few weeks\nTheir average played out along the lines that sadly have become\nSomewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat\nThere were gross distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside doctor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ...\nHospital that went on\nHospitals vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem the old players weren't working\nThe distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts\nReceived an reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh\nFormal people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem the old players weren't working the distortions\nWere being literally drowned out by the facts\nSenators received an reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination that for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest\nCourt three hundred plus opinions\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character\nSo it was clear mind president they owe taxes weren't working wasn't going to get the job done the resistance demanded more\nTry something new they said\nWell we all know what happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the committee collected test and all they organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh was seven\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the committee collected tested all organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh\nSeventh FBI investigation\nBy and embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWas producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh no corroborating evidence from the FBI and for our\nOr from anywhere else nothing\nWill not wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they'd been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yet again\nI Believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nCreated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nSo we're still one vote short as they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat is right in this bill may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely have to leave the United states give a listen\nTo some of that let's bring that up and give a listen Moran\nMs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called them this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that key voted to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nVote absolutely and reducing the number of senators that they're very often this voting periods of time\nOK silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet\nOr unclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these thoughts can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that they're ... very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely aren't even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move for Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree to would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that for an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the culmination\nFor Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime really of campaigning for a change the federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killers\nMr Toomey\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner Okay Mark ...\nLifetime really of campaigning for changed federal judiciary and let's just this little listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killers\nMr Toomey Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote ... Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live out the vote is in is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm since the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay de telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware as the other the Delaware I went to ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nJeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nOh this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and it really is that I live in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the convention a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling NASA is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he ... the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude\nSome gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of just this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only at ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is the correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin\nThat's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is key procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month of he's\nA difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be a coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and\nWe're going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mansion in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate that test vote in a sense and just to remind people or maybe joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring in another voice here as we await the final tally the not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex comment has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\n... could be with him so what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\n[noise] [noise] well it's like it's gonna be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nAnd you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think it was looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been used as a gap as a lot of the services shown as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparently gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee\nFrom a Republican perspective we wanted we wanted to have a a a another appointee on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nAnd day sunny and dry dig into the ... about eighty five in Phoenix maybe a couple of degrees warmer tomorrow tomorrow night watch for more rain with a fifty percent range

nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one that knows are forty nine the notion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate a kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court\nAll is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate to kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving is covered politics for very long time as well good morning to you both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and a new you know I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple\nOf weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well it was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill to court that was sort of like a balance sport sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the vote is five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and they may\nMove on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore\nI think you can expect the conservatives to win and they may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to and to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue the conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nBe a good heart even this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to in the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question of arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that ...\nThat example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases in which presuming he is confirmed on the final votes\nAnd I and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that I ...\nI appreciate that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights\nAnd and and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a so that a minority cannot block\nA action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there've been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska another one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to a to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes\nVoting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride Ron Elving it is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote\nWhy ... why would she do that\nFor reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes voting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron Elving\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would she do that\nWell that the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't and\nAt the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor\nShe has not said that let's be snow she did not say that and and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option\nShe may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure on she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules\nWere different when that sort of thing would happen you'd get sixty votes for cloture then maybe only fifty two votes to pass\nIf you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who was a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote\nAnd then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the fact free verdict of the mall\nAlaska was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who is a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the facts free verdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail\nMostly uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the Senate will have the final so\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer to date with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now more lately is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly email\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learn this news of the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch the next twenty four hours a and they are the uh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know\nShe might be actually trying to uh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know he deserves a vote I'm going to vote no but he deserves to vote that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe Manchin who uh\nUh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know\nShe might be actually trying to uh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know deserves a vote on a vote no but he deserves to vote that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe Manchin who\nUh I think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a an his vote today a to a vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now\nUh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nAt northern Arizona university has led to rapid growth in Flagstaff this morning at nine on the show why some residents are concerned about that and what they want to do about it and

or high about eighty five maybe some rain this weekend it's Seventy two in Phoenix at eight twenty\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we have been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court is not quite there yet this was a vote to end debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one senator\nSusan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today\nPerhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote\nMatter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine\nHas specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today\nPerhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nBut the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote for a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine is the vote and let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to you here to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won an election state wide as a write in candidate [laughter] you know the the odds of doing that anyway\nNARAL can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to your ear to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no or certainly shows you know the kind of independence she has shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate to beat the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allow us to Alaska and well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because she's a very well known names and yeah and not as many people\nAs a you know some of the other states so she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought\nCould be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nOr because of the politics of\nEither their Koch is a with a Collins or of their state with Joe ... and when\nWe say profile in courage we're defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody up as high as ... well I mean that's one thing that I'm not a fix which suggests that not as a Democrat or pro democratic same I mean that as somebody who would do with their voting rights go against their base so when\nYou think about um what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor later when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with\nThe pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mansion\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an outright still be fifty votes would be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol\nThe U.S with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia these three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be an outright still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor\nBut protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake in an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday and must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward [noise]\n\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories\nSo we have the broad issue and then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been

we've heard countless stories\nSo we have the broad issue and then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't it a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody to be promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter is to pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick\nGarland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell says Mitch McConnell said\nWe're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with the just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never ... an island and\nAnd and Obama had thought he was doing a\nI'm a a reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick that she picked a lottery he picked a moderate liberal uh of ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans\nIn his own caucus and made that happened and never ... an island and and and Obama had thought he was doing a\nI'm a a reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick that she picked a moderate he picked a moderate liberal\nOr a book and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland is no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the O. J.\n... whole month and that that you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nA Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening to this and as I listened to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts Ron ah because we also a veteran on NPR News frequently cover the middle east\nAnd every debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen but when you're on\nAnswers that I've just I Wonder if they lose their head which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take a moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and it and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now depends on what what a beginning point you want to want to\nOver and he didn't do that and the ... and ... and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started in Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now it depends on what what a beginning point you want to want to set for when the story started to go wrong yes there are some similarities here and\nFor Republicans years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan did the Supreme Court and out as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time they had just one of the year before they had one it's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they had lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan landslide and that was significant because they were winning in the south\nWith black voters they were winning with African American votes\nAnd Teddy Kennedy made the case and other senators made the case\nTraffic no late in our morning commuter crashed

nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected tomorrow there was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators\nWhose votes runs certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nRepublican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kavanaugh or at least to devote now against uh on on uh on on the debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes uh put his vote down things could change and\nMurkowski of Alaska Republican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kavanaugh or at least have to vote no against uh on on uh on on the debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes\nUh put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there is at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote\nWhen the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what\nWhat evidence do we have to go on as to the way she's leaving well\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching this quartet you know the final four voters and there is a possibility that people vote differently\nFor cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins and she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of Betsy device for education secretary in fact\nShe wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently in the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and pot tensions [laughter] there's your health committee yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that she still had concerns about how ... how much you would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a Collins and for or against um the boss and wound up forcing\nA Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney had to come down and break a tie on a pack\nPublic education at the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a Collins and for or against 'em do off and wound up forcing\nA Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney had to come down and break the tie on a package of\nTax just a reminder that the vote today it was a vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and you may choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christine ... is executive vice president for policy at the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ...\nCome on and so what are you thinking about this vote\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting that in notable that there's bipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct\nAnd I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw serious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nIt's yeah it's just not correct to say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony of considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republican uh out of fifty one who voted no ah this has been a very very partisan vote in ... equally partisan on the Democratic side is not\nWell I don't think I think it is bipartisan\nJust a ... you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate there was one Republican one Republican or out of fifty one who voted no this has been a very very partisan vote to move to equally part is among the Democratic side is not\nWell I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nA usually people uh want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when was the confirmation vote\nIt sends a really strong signal\nAbout how troubled she is by this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court\nSo I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote but\nI think this nomination is in trouble and so today's procedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg\nSo you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine lousy forward letter in early July [noise]\nUm and ... you you were a senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which are Christian shifts both [laughter] so hot\nAt you and and Dianne Feinstein and said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone it it was there uh\nIn early July um and I you you were a senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which a Christian shifts both [laughter] so hot\nAt you and and Dianne Feinstein and said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone\nIt it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it realistically now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as\nShe handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public and I think Senator Feinstein honored\nHer wishes and I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about\nWhich is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if\nEver you decide to tell your story\n... I'm thinking about that was it impossible for her to tip offs we are we are to mention it to someone so there could be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island or to the chairman staff and the chairman staff released the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could ... you know share it with other members and still preserve confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as a matter of five\nI'm going to come forward from Rhode Island or to the chairman staff and the chairman staff released the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could ... you know share it with other members and still preserved confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so\nI view it as that or if I'm really was respecting the survivor here\nAnd I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or stuff has been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who uh had possession of a letter we don't know who else might have been told\nAnd in what way both in the end it leaked do you believe it automatically had to lick was there an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been on corroborated I'm Better at an individual will do more to go on the record\nWell I I don't know who leaked it but I think that\nThis experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week is there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone or who will suddenly confessed to a senator or they're interrupting in in an elevator\nI think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women\nHave experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good\nAnd I'm I'm really worried that Christine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter at a campaign rally sent exactly the wrong message to those survivors\nSexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good\nAnd I'm I'm really worried that ah Christine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter and a campaign rally sense exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere that they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nLet me ask about one thing along those lines from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julie ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article of touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she described herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teams\nBut said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to take seriously investigate these kinds of allegations of difference between the broad issue and the specific question of whether a specific individual can be proved guilty through some neutral process here\nHas there been some confusion of one with the other on this issue people who are concerned about the broader issue have assumed the Kavanaugh must be guilty because they're concerned about the issue or the reverse for that matter", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "05"}
