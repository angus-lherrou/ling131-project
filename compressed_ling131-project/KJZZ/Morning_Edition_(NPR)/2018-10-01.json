land of equal opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future is as many kids by finding out the ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data tool being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries Jedi has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and

zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes\nDon't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten the head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nAdolescent surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder Carmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem the group identified\nThat we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was a segregated city where low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at as to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of care math median income\nCharlotte said a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity atlas for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for this is\nThe outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is that\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority white maybe not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric ... says the schools students are mostly black and Hispanic so we got forty eight point nine percent\nTo think about how to act on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration that community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric heartfelt says the schools students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we have forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student\nBody that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility\nJames e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now but when in the coming years it changes it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThe century old neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends\nEighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park Ford says that might surprise some people\nWe may as soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man the social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity atlas should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us to start making really smart and really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allow we could look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction\nMecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K for all children the city of Charlotte

a revolution in cancer treatment\nThat nobody on the family have today's either to ward yeah two thousand a Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine jointly to James on the phone and how school ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checked\nFor physiology or medicine will be given to two scientists who's discoveries have led to a revolution in cancer treatment\nThe November the family have today's ... to ... to soften the Nobel Prize or ... or join the shame on this phone how ... ...\nThese two scientists invented a new kind of cancer treatment called immune checkpoint inhibitors with us in the studio to tell us more NPR science correspondent Richard Harris Corning Richard good morning so who are these two winners\nWell the price of being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and also by to sue ... who's at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years a Nobel Prize comes as a complete surprise ... not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock of but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer so they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective in attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution in cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard of that we've talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alison the other scientists who is winning this word ... how do you have any now that him\nA hundred work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on you\nLead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard of that we talked about them a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers in the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning this word ... how do\nYou have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about it as a drug called ... true to nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target\nHuh fascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer ...\nWell before the so I just made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese right I mean we hear a lot of in you know therapy how effective are these new therapies for this one really wants to know why it went\nAnd that's an evolving issue it in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies of failed and some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma and is recovering\nKnow therapy is no really the driving force behind drug development these right I mean we hear a lot about immunotherapy how effective are these new therapies that's what has one really wants to know it went and that's an evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recoveries remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are networking on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\nBetter understand our world in our community were screaming on line ... to work and you can follow us on Twitter at key Jaycee sci fi next\nMhm [noise]\n\n\nIt's four

health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are a niche product always have been that's Doug badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many or is more affordable than the other products is built on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage [noise]\nMore than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans the new rules allow people to buy\nThe administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining on shore to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible has met so people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover\nAnd what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about ...\nThat doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live in the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover\nWhat

that governance but not to the point where you would endanger is\nNot this is a very odd or think with the Palestinians are demanding\nSomething that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the middle east and reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have bought and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to

don't see that much terrorism and and that was back well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good I'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of

much terrorism in a in the west bank well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority\nThat's good I'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by us but here's how it's done we have say intelligence about um uh terrorists or in a one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we\nYou know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk within attacked as we weren't at\nThe un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us internationally\nFinal prime minister 'cause they know your time is very ...

part of Iraq has been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen nineties to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and posting arrived joins us now from the Kurdish city of ...\nGene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Kurdish parliament could look like\nFor the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it's aimed at young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties to multiply\nDecades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nWith multiple not just a lot of people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately for you the walkers and making ... inside of the most almost lost huh\nAnd by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people was turn out good as a result of this frustration you're at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears is almost been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballots [noise] because they decided not to do the automated valid counting because they think that leads to fraud and he's reading of the names of each party's very laborious process right\nStations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to

you'd think would be like super squeaky clean or people trying to get in with fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government and the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan\nAffects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy is so it's all quite up in the air but um yeah a lot of
