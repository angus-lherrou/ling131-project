Kavanaugh's uh her story is that a cabinet exposed himself to her at a party when they're both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off of those so\nDemocrats have also increasingly talked about Kevin ... drinking um since that could have bearing

week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a court remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were very very big you know they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the

was that um they were very very they get that were very tight group loss of solidarity very to time and women some of them I'm wearing ... you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us there was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are
