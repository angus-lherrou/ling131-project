to Monday or the deficit figures from the Treasury Department up Seventeen percent from a year ago seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it kinda seems a that those numbers of lost on meaning though they are\nWell sort of I mean everyone told Republicans is was going to happen and they did it anyway it um you know the the\nThe deficit is the difference between how much we're spending and how much we're collecting how that continuously grows\nFor some reason conservatives have managed to convince Americans that if we collect less money will have more money against all logic\nSo now everyone's and in the Republican Party saying we might have to cut entitlements because now we have this crazy deficit and more money is going to go to interest payments we can't have that everybody told them from the beginning that this is how it was going to look\nAnd uh it's just sad that we have this kind of weird cognitive dissonance it\nBears mentioning here not for the first time I was

why do we care about the national debt why do we care about the deficit um it wouldn't you spend increasingly more and more and more money you have the calls to get rid of entitlement programs like Medicare Social security that kind of stuff\nAh those calls get louder and louder and louder because um you know that because the Republicans are going to be ... at least right now advocating more for
