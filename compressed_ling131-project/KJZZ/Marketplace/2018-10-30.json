shore and where one imagines things go from here with consumer spending\nMore and more and more for the past seven months without wages ramping up you might wonder whether some kind of issue is going to drop\nThere's no reason to believe that if they were spending is poised for material to slow down and\nJames Bond agrees with economic forecasting firm I just market GDP Growth was three point five percent and the third quarter faster than economists were expecting\nThe state of the consumer is pretty much the best it's been in in decades and you know that's characterized by low unemployment rising income um and then the tax cuts of course\nThis is despite slow wage growth Alan ... is an economist at UPS\nWith all these than overall income growth just because people are putting in more hours we've been having more people being hired even though the wages for individuals have been going up rather modestly they're starting to pick up for now\nAs long as jobs keep getting created consumer spending should be strong so what might threaten jobs well tariffs for one\nOver the next six months or so it's likely that we'll we'll see some flowing in employment and income as firms take

cloud computing from red hat it is the biggest acquisition IBM's ever made\nA bet on the big market for cloud computing marketplaces ... has that one\nWe all know there are different types of clouds in the sky right strategy clouds are closer to the ground in serious clouds are way up there were cuts for data work the same way companies put some info and servers far away but not all of it came forest at Fort ... capital says sometimes you need the info lightning quick\nIt was over in China over in Europe you don't know where the cloud really is all that back and forth takes too long so you have to have stuff close to you like they got to your business\nHaving some clouds close and some far is called hybrid cloud that requires the different clubs to talk to one another and red hat makes software to do that it's a big reason IBM bought the company together read had an IBM hope to take on the big big boys in cloud computing Amazon and Michael\nDon't know where the cloud really is all

story about getting what you pay for or more accurately getting what you don't pay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country\nTo know that our infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increased it gas tax not too long ago\nHere's a story about getting what you pay for or more accurately getting what you don't pay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country\nTo know that our infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even prove those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increased it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens with new taxes not everybody is happy about 'em and they have taken to the ballot with

overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators called the ... is chairman of the yes on prop six campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement\nThe politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money so we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it\nBut even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these taxes haven't been indexed to inflation another reason can be seen directly across that street\nIn downtown LA at a Honda dealership its windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars Krista Ghouta is out on the law joking with other salesmen\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of it that\nCustom and nine costs have told me for the first day but I

Lakers are in town is a busy around here I'm going to break that it's only nine o'clock in the morning but\nUm yes when the Lakers are here this would be when they would normally practice oh right here in our um\nGee league a coaching staff as they get ready for ... yeah the south bay Lakers is our team\nUm that we use to develop our draft picks you know bringing free agents that weren't drafted I'll take you in here to the war room because more than ... says take where the draft is how\nDo you know ... or one two three four uh four or five like minded shoulders and screams all the

or want to root for at least four or five like Ninety urged soldiers and screen which are shows us ... of course I'm with this and you can or the best of all yes would you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and when you know when you hear the basketball's it's kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if oh so there you go you know we are one of the players we\nCan do is we rooms trading rooms right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms and joke so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the places where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us and and be part of what we're building and we've missed the class every year for five years\nSo this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to it in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view in la brown and Luke Walton you're coaching and Magic Johnson drugs for basketball and you know Kobe and and the other best for grits\nOur fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view a little brown and Luke Walton you're coaching and Magic Johnson drove for basketball and you know ... and the other best brokerage of you guys have the conversation on yourself about look this isn't going to be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah ... you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball they're\nReally interesting because liquor both couples like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years you know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right\nAnd we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more of a push all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business here don't do so too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to read uncertain he was going\nWas killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said Jeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground didn't really say oh yeah oh my God it's like [noise]\nWas the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to read an surgery was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground who said oh yeah when we looked like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long is it going to take you to\nGet the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kitt [laughter] if a laugh\nOr would hear about your family right I mean Dr Bush or to your brother who work with them and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book where we've talked about it in your views about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial read culture and says don't blow it with the family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nWas very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent or is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody\nWorthy and the power to make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent or is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke them your question about about and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you were too long\nThat was my first comment publicly was I apologized to Laker fans because perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff I Know because yeah it's like these young players they they're used to multitasking there used to having music while they're doing whatever\nLet me show you into a\nNo wonder you know you're a room with [noise]\n... this is my office uh one and I mean actually this is the trophy room I just happened on my desk in here and so we're\nGoing to be the postman under the terms of your trip that's cool [noise] Sherman who felt that\nThe reason you know it it was important the trophies were displayed so that the players could see that this is the inspiration or\nAre we overlook record and if they look or they will students trophies younger\nHere's a great feature\nGetting here and so are are never\nGoing to be the postman or be attributed trouble that's cool it's seven\nSo that the reason you
