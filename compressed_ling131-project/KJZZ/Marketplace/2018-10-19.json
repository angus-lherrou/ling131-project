actually the budget deficit all seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars over the last fiscal year he's Seventeen percent increase over the prior year that was on Monday and then yesterday\nPresident Trump said he wants to cut five percent from the federal budget next fiscal year and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he is disturbed by the deficit and blames Social Security and Medicare\nBut here's a big chunk of the increase in what we're going to do every year is because the federal government is pulling in less tax revenue thanks to the tax cuts passed last year yes the tax cuts that were going to pay for themselves marketplaces Kimberly Adams drugs in on how that has gone\nSo ... despite the rhetoric in the run up to the passage of the tax law\nTax cuts were never going to pay for themselves\nBrian Reed all is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and used to work for the Senate Finance committee\nAt this point\nLess tax revenue thanks to the

tax law\nTax cuts were never going to pay for themselves\nBrian Reed all is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and used to work for the Senate Finance committee\nAt this point there is no real scenario which sucks cuts for themselves are probably going to cost truer to two and a half trillion dollars over the years\nBut let's review that scenario where they do pay for themselves over ten years first you cut corporate taxes businesses invest that increases productivity wages go up and boom that\nMagical three percent growth per year we've heard so much about our ... at the American Enterprise Institute says it's too early to know what's working\nSo I think looking at one is numbers and saying well the tax cuts are not working and adding to the deficits instead of reducing them I think is is is kind of misleading\nEven if things take time she says time isn't the only issue we paid for these tax cuts with a dead\nEven in an ideal world where everybody imagines a tax cuts they for themselves in that period he takes place in a situation where the tax cuts themselves and not deficit finance\nAnother wrinkle companies aren't spending their tax savings the way tax writers planned stand colander is an expert on the federal budget for example he says we've only seen a modest increase in wages also\nCompanies aren't investing they're using it to pay off debt and they're
