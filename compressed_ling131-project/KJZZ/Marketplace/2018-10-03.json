introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders\nHe called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bay those act\nAs in Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax\nIt's Tuesday October seconds good to have you with us before we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders\nHe called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop Bezos act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states of Amazon\nThe idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages well Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this she's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\nWait hind employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nAmazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part-time temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States is about ... about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment\nSome changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about uh about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely oh a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers\nAmazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Wal Mart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that direction\nReally I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier\nUm so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market\nAs Wal Mart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example it's hard to do so I didn't want it to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where this raise we'll have\nBuying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies it also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think\nCommunities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly\nThere are places where this raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses on their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets\nA would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut fewer of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation\nIf wages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some optics and inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much Thanksgiving\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising

to some of the people who would know best\nAlex ... is twenty two years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast

actually like if you're like forty hours every week or more than that will be alert show much\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah she's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we hadn't bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with and being able to pay off his dad's\nI actually just paid off last year a car loan\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSplitting rent some was um an enormous all\nWhile cities like New York Los Angeles in Seattle are mandating Fifteen dollar an hour wages the fight for Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the country will get\nThe debt I actually just paid off last year a car loan\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with\nThree

of\nThese projects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches

hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively\nFunded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up and that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies\nThe people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties so these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect in which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some communities actually find most of this work themselves through local and county taxes\nAnd so in that case the federal government isn't really involved but for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions\nThey use that economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is\nIs that the corps tries to see which projects can they fund where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominant\nDecisions they use an economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is\nIs that the corps tries to see which projects can they fund where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up savoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities but something like Ninety four percent white\nAnd you found that the effect is that they're the same beaches just keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example tell me about rights bill beach\nSure right seal beach has been rebuilt I think more than twenty times in its history and uh this is a community we found where you know some of the properties right along the ocean are easily
