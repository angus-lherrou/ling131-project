nearly fifty year low on the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent\nSo we will start there and then merger further or perhaps farther afield I never get 'em right Catherine Rampell writes for the Washington both Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones everybody\nHey Ken Hi Kay\nSo Neal its job day you're on that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that ah the jobs report was actually a little bit of a mess on the number of jobs but but people should be happy with it wages however are another thing entirely still and again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be a market for it let's see they have that right at wages wages where the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained frozen wages as a little bit lower than than last month that but some growth at two point eight percent it was enough to spark some concern in the market\nThat this would spill over to consumer and prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pick up and go out with enough\nAh too concerned the markets about inflation and rising rates and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and the president and where we stand it is somehow amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA a China is still out there uh we have a still a president ah who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on housing\nA to trade and ah the president and where we stand it is somehow amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA a China is still out there uh we have a still a president or who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with terrorists and counter terrorists and breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um [laughter]\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly a breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure I is kind of ... there are that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric [laughter] suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nBut that's a good one the debris globalization Neal put on your your actual certified economists at which I should point out you are a ... and a poet bad for me to a you know thirty five thousand foot level and talk about what Katherine was talking about this idea that\nWe are now distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics you're being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done\nAnd where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's German perhaps\nFor it's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing

for the remaining two years of the president's term and perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing\nWhich is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened\nTook a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China and the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back and so as much as markets chaired\nThe continuation of NAFTA or some kind of knew named as rose that smells a sweet [laughter] um it's hard to translate a U.S flow when\nIn North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power in terms of their economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they set right in the middle of\nTo have some great monsters slow when that's a great line I'm OK well let me let me turn to the news today because we have to acknowledge it a Susan Collins declaring that she is in fact senator from Maine that she was in fact in their vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nUh Joe mentioned doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court or come you know mother Tuesday I Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean

foreign bills and all that stuff still has to be done thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller where does things were ...\nI I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage or and and the presidency is well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around for the last crisis uh\nTen years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's going to happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones knew what you quickly for\nSure and I just want to add on to like cats and I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you wanna call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nUh a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are are
