their premise a I was representing my district back in twenty sixteen I was fighting for southern Arizona and and there was one of my own campaign and I've never endorsed anyone for anything whether president or dog catcher and so I just continued with that path\nBut he's now in office and as the president of the United states\nAnd we have this historic opportunity to move America in a new direction and we've done that since he's been in office we've cut taxes we roll back regulations were working to rebuild our military we're working to secure our border so there's so many opportunities that we have in front of us\nAnd I built a good relationship with the president uh the first time I was invited over there I talked to him about the eight ten ward off the plane that I flew and how we see that a lot diminish ration tried to you know put it in the bone yard but how important it was to keep it fly and because it protects our troops and I talk to him right then into becoming an eight ten fan\nA I'm a working with this administration ... related to sanctuary cities and MS Thirteen gangs are so many things that we have to work on\nSo what's happened is because of

with you tonight and Martha it's good to see you were going to have a good conversation tonight on the issues that matter most to Arizona families rising healthcare costs protecting Medicare and Social Security and keeping our country safe and secure\nBut there'll be some differences that you'll see clear in this evening I been laser focused on the issues that matter most to Arizona families in everyday Arizona's Walmart has chosen to run a campaign based on nasty smears and false attacks\nAnd I expect you'll see more of that this evening but Arizona and snow that I've never been afraid to stand alone to do what's right and I always work with anyone to get things done in Arizona and that's the approach I've taken the United States Congress\nHunger is all in the family did you want to respond to any part of that sure absolutely I mean we've heard these talking points a lot already now just talking specifically about the campaigns I had a rough Fifteen million dollars so far as of attack ads against me\nFrom tears in cinema and our allies in fact in the primary over two million dollars were spent against me a ... by an organization that was a her previous can political consultant with a part of and it was a bit of a sneak attack 'cause when we found out George Soros and Chuck Schumer actually behind them\nWe're now up to Fifteen million dollars so what every day Arizona is really care about our job opportunities and we've been able to work on that and provide more opportunities for them we have more jobs right now more people are more jobs opening that people are looking for jobs\nAnd this is really providing more future and more opportunities for people in Arizona and we're going to keep working on that\nEveryday Arizona's can't afford their health care because Obamacare has\nNow up to Fifteen million dollars so what every day Arizona is really care about our job opportunities and we've been able to work on that and provide more opportunities for them we had more jobs right now more people are more jobs opening that people are looking for jobs\nAnd this is really providing more future and more opportunities for people in Arizona and we're going to keep working on that\nEveryday Arizona's can't afford their health care because Obamacare has failed and we need to make sure that we provide affordable available health care for them\nCongresswoman should've I asked the congresswoman Shelley regarding what had changed as what has changed with you may remember you as being a more liberal than you are now back when you were in the state legislature no you vote more often than not with President Trump will changed well\nIts head as Arizona and snow I had been lucky and privilege to serve this great state both in the state legislature and of course now in Congress for the last six years and over the years I'm proud to say that I have taken the time to learn and grow and occasionally even changed my opinion\nWhen I served in the U.S Congress for my first several terms with congressman Sam and he and I worked together on a variety of issues including keeping our country safe and growing businesses in Arizona\nAnd protecting trade so over time I think it makes sense for individuals who are willing to learn and to grow\nThe difference I think between Martha's approach in my approach is that Martha opposed to many of these issues before running for Senate and then changed her mind very quickly I've been serving for many years in the United States Congress and before that in the legislature\nAnd have overtime been able to grow and become even better at my job serving Arizona's\nAnd folks now in Arizona ... always put their interests first never party so as you mentioned Ted I often do vote against my own party and that's something I think Arizona's depend on and are proud of they want an independent voice in the United States Congress and what they want in the United States Senate\nMany years in the United States Congress and before that in the legislature and have over time been able to grow and become even better at my job serving Arizona's\nAnd folks now in Arizona are always put their interests first never party\nSo as you mentioned had I often do vote against my own party and that's something I think Arizona's depend on and are proud of they want an independent voice in the United States Congress and what they want in the United States Senate is someone they know who stands up for them not just does what party leaders tell them to do\nHave you changed your attitude about the first question Congress will change do where they actually\nNot I left my home at the age of Eighteen and joined the military I lost my dad when I was twelve and I was looking for opportunities to get a good education is the youngest of five kids so I chose to serve in uniform for twenty six years\nI put my life on the line for our country I flew three hundred and twenty five combat hours protecting our freedoms and our way of life\nI'm now serving in Congress and I've been leading on the issues of supporting our military securing the border and providing more economic opportunity for people and I been consistently doing that both serving in Congress and now running for the Senate my record is clear and it's consistent unlike my opponent\nOf real quickly you much of the new we're going to appear with President Trump to this week's yeah are you proud of the way President Trump has conducted himself in office the\nTrump ... ran for president one time and one\nUh and he's a disruptor he went to D.C to shake things up and he's doing that and we're seeing the results from that not a lot of people wanted to tackle the challenges of North Korea getting access to a nuclear weapon that could hold American city hostage\nNot a lot of people wanted to address updating bad trade agreement so that it would help Americans and so he does things for sure in Washington DC but providing more opportunities for Americans and Arizona's while ensuring that we're safe and secure from the threats\nThings up and he's doing that and we're seeing the results from that not a lot of people wanted to tackle the challenges of North Korea getting access to a nuclear weapon that could hold American city hostage\nNot a lot of people wanting to address updating bad trade agreement so that it would help Americans\nAnd so he does things for sure in Washington DC but providing more opportunities for Americans and Arizona's while ensuring that we're safe and secure from the threats that are out there who you're proud of the way President Trump has behaved I Am proud that he is gone to the White House and he is leading our country in the right direction\nI Am proud to be working with him to provide more opportunities and to make sure we keep our country safe he didn't need to be doing this I've gotten to know him over the last year and a half\nAnd he loves America and he's fighting for Americans every single day and I'm going to keep working with him to provide more opportunities for\nAll of us had I think this is an area where we do have a difference of opinion I Believe Arizona says service senator who just cause the balls and strikes and doesn't just always agree with their party leaders and so Martha has a Ninety eight percent voting record with her party and with our president\nWhich I think demonstrate that she's not willing to do what's right for Arizona if the president's wrong on an issue I'll give you an example\nRecently the president instituted very harsh terrorists and it started a trade war\nAnd that is devastating for Arizona's businesses and for our agricultural community\nI really think we need to move on to some other important topics because literally this has been debunked and she just taking up time but if you want to talk about protecting children then let's make sure we don't take a donations from back page dot com\nHere's it's intimate took fifty three thousand dollars back page dot dot com owners and it was until she was put under pressure while they were under investigation that she finally was shamed and giving it back\nAnd when she was in the Arizona Legislature when they were trying to hold John's accountable for going after him victims of child sex trafficking she was advocating for the job is saying that the girls twelve and Thirteen year old you know looked older than her look I'm not making this stuff up these are her words and\nAsk people to go to the real sentiment dot com to find out the facts 'cause this make over ... has been pretty impressive but people deserve to know what her record is what our past\nAnd what the facts are and the things she has advocated for\nDo you believe you honestly believe she was protecting adult men who are molesting children\nI Would ask people to go watch the whole video she wasn't offensive to\nGo to the real cinema dot com to find out the facts 'cause this snake over as been pretty impressive but people deserve to know what her record is what our past and what the facts are and the thing she has advocated for\nDo you believe you honestly believe she was protecting adult men who are molesting children\nI Would ask people to go watch the whole video she was a defense attorney so I I mean I guess that's where it comes from your will let them but it but in\nIn that discussion and then later on in ... and twenty ten in another hearing uh the based on her concerns for age Fifteen sixteen and Seventeen year old the jobs are basically in that bill allowed to have an affirmative defense that said\nI didn't know there are Fifteen sixteen or Seventeen years old and that's the bill that was changed when she says she voted on it but in two thousand ten watch the tape the real cinema dot com pay bills and is there\nA tirelessly advocating for children because she's seen the scores\nAnd in an argument with representative cinema because she was asking well what's changed why can't we just keep it as it is and Peggy passionately saying it's because they're getting off with less than a traffic\nTicket so again I just ask voters there's so much at stake here please do the research go to real cinema dot com and you can see for yourself respond please\nMartha's saving out is I actually voted yes on both of those bills after they went and worked hand in hand with my colleague Republican Adam drags often attorney to make sure that this legislation toughened the penalties against these bad guys who engaged in this horrible activity\nAnd something that's important for folks to know about me is that this has been my entire career my first job was as a rape crisis counts are working at a domestic violence shelter and since then I've committed my life and career to protecting women and children from abuse and from assault and my record is strong and twenty third\nShouldn't toughened the penalties against these bad guys who engaged in this horrible activity and something that's important for folks to know about me is that this has been my entire career\nMy first job was as a rape crisis counts are working at a domestic violence shelter and since then I've committed my life and career to protecting women and children from abuse and from assault and my record is strong and twenty Thirteen when we pass the violence against women reauthorization act to give\nBetter tools to law enforcement to crack down on these kinds of heinous crimes I lead that effort\nBut just last month when the vote came up to reauthorize this for the long term Martha voted no to give a long term reauthorization to the violence against women act so I Would encourage folks to go take a look at the votes and as we heard this morning in the Arizona Republic this is ridiculous\nWe ask people to just go look at our vote record because it speaks for itself\nYes it does speak for itself and that is absolutely ally that's like a procedural vote that she's pulled a few out there there was nothing to do with the author as I recall throws into violence against women act so please don't believe that\nI'm going back to congresswoman cinema and the original question about Brett Kavanaugh one of the main sticking points on both sides has been discussion about whether justice Kavanaugh would support overturning roe v Wade where do you stand on that issue\nI Believe decisions important decisions such as that should be made between a woman her family and her doctor free from government interference\nAnd where do you stand on that I Am pro life and I have a very strong pro life record so you wouldn't support overturned opera and I know I'm focused when it comes to judges on how they interpret the constitution and how they interpret the laws that we make it's not a particularly that ms test but I have a very strong pro\nShould be made between a woman and her family and her doctor free from government interference\nAnd where do you stand on that I Am pro life and I have a very strong pro life record so you won support overturned a ride and I know I'm focused when it comes to judges on how they interpret the constitution and how they interpret the laws that we make it's not a particularly that ms test but I have a very strong pro life record\nSo you would support the overturning of ... I\nWould support appointing justices I mean this has nothing to do with what Congress is working on the Senate I Would support appointing justices that aren't are looking independently at the constitution and at the laws that we make a and that they will have a good decision making process based on that [noise]\nAll right let's move on to health care a congresswoman or Mick Sally [noise]\nHow much should government be involved in health here especially when it concerns folks to find it difficult to get healthcare specifically those with pre existing conditions what is the government's role\nThanks head for the opportunity again to debunk another attack or from my opponent I voted to protect people with pre existing conditions to make sure insurance companies were forced to give them health care had no cats and insurance and could not canceling that is just a flat out lie we cannot go back to where we were before Obamacare\nWhere people were one diagnosis away from going bankrupt because they could not get access to health care\nAnd so it although was trying to fix it\nObamacare was the wrong or you know the wrong approach it's a trillion dollars in taxes it's rotting Medicare by seven hundred and sixty billion dollars it's mandates and penalties that were really intending to go after those who are falling through the cracks who didn't get healthcare from their employer or Medicare and Medicaid\nBecause they could not get access to health care\nAnd so it although was trying to fix it\nObamacare was the wrong or you know the wrong approach it's a trillion dollars in taxes it's rotting Medicare by seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars it's mandates and penalties that were really intended to go after those who are falling through the cracks who didn't get healthcare\nFrom their employer or Medicare and Medicaid it ends up is about seven percent of people and they're falling through the cracks there are still falling through the cracks had because I I met an entrepreneur this last week\nWho decided to start her own business oh who has three conditions but because of Obamacare and because of skyrocketing costs she has no coverage right now more people will pay the penalty last year than actually bought insurance on the Obamacare exchanges so we have to address the issue and we've got to make sure we protect people with preexisting conditions but\nThe Obamacare model has failed we move forward with a an approach that gives people tax credits and gives them options to shop around more and more small business support to have association health plans more opportunity for people to give to health savings accounts\nThat still can provide affordable available a health insurance for them which isn't working right now under Obamacare So we've got to protect it\nThe federal level there should be apart but it's best man is at the state as well where there's more options for them to be innovative because what works in California is not what works in Arizona were ...\nWell I'm so glad we're talking about health care because it is the number one issue that I hear from folks both on the campaign trail is I travel the state and in my office in the United States Congress Arizona's are very worried that they will lose coverage for those with preexisting health conditions\nNearly three million Arizona instead with preexisting health conditions one example is a woman named Leslie uh she lives in Scottsdale she was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in high school and she's been\nSure that I hear from folks both on the campaign trail as I travel the state and in my office in the United States Congress Arizona's are very worried that they will lose coverage for those with preexisting health conditions\nNearly three million Arizona instead with preexisting health conditions one example is a woman named Leslie uh she lives in Scottsdale she was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in high school and she's been taking five insulin shots a day for forty seven years\nBut when Martha voted last year to repeal existing law it would have eliminated the protections for people who live with preexisting conditions in our country today she also voted to repeal that same protection and two thousand Fifteen\nSo the reality is that Arizona is are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection away\nTo that is just a flat out lie again either just classic fear tactics if you turn on a TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions and as we were moving forward and nothing was moving through the Senate related to this issue\nFourteen or Fifteen counties in Arizona there was only one choice last year that is not a choice and the premiums have gone up over a hundred percent year to year there's so many people right now a pre existing conditions they can't get access to health care because Obamacare model doesn't work\nBut when things came to a standstill and we were watching these individuals' still not able to get access to health insurance I said\nMy Democrat colleagues and the problem solvers caucus and we sat down to see if there's any way we can find some common ground to help these people get access to health insurance and we can put in there was a couple of our Democrat colleagues out there with a white board in my office\nWe know when we there's something we can find to help states\nWatching these individuals' still not able to get access to health insurance I\nMy Democrat colleagues and the problem solvers caucus and we sat down to see if there's any way we can find some common ground to help these people get access to health insurance and we came up at the end there was a couple of our Democrat colleagues out there with the way board in my office we know when we\nThere's something we can find to help states\nWas collapsing and we came up with a plan at twenty three Democrats or Republicans\nAt least the the majority of the group agreed to so we showed that we can break through the gridlock solve the problem and actually help people get the insurance that they deserve and get the care that they deserve with the conditions that they have in their family again governments players in health care\nWell one thing I think all Americans can agree on as we cannot go back to a time when people couldn't get coverage when they had preexisting health conditions\nSo I'm Martha talks about a working group and part of the problem solvers caucus which I Am a proud member of the reality is that we took the vote\nAnd during the vote Martha voted to repeal these protections and they are the protections that Arizona and count on every day that seemed vote also took away protections for people age is fifty to sixty four and would've allowed states to begin charging them as much as five times more for their coverage\nThat's just not fair and finally that piece of legislation that she voted for would've increased premiums by as much as Fifteen hundred dollars per year per family\nSo while we all can agree that our health care system is broken it needs to be fixed\nThe solutions that Martha has voted for actually make the system worse and hurt Arizona and but she's avoided talking about this issue during the campaign because she knows that her vote hurts Arizona and and as I said chosen to just lob attacks against me on other issues\nEmily so while we all can agree that our health care system is broken and needs to be fixed\nThe solutions that Martha has voted for actually make the system worse and hurt Arizona ends but she's avoided talking about this issue during the campaign because she knows that her vote hurts Arizona and and as I said chosen to just lava tax against me another issue", "year": "2018",
