... it is Monday the first of October good as always to have you with us\nAnd we start today with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nThis we will ever result of much more happening right here in the United states it means more than anything goes far more American Jobs and these are high\nTo replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\n... manufacturing powerhouse that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs around the center of the rhetoric of everything and the and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars of trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW\nRight now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yup was set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these tours or else I take away your phone right we say that in my house while the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you made cars in Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession you might say well you know\nHi it's Phil Latzman and thank you for listening to kj ... online service which is supported by ... education foundations are proud sponsor of the cage ACC education desk he Leo's education foundation believes every student regardless of ZIP Code deserves a high quality education\nFind out ... dot org the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain and finding parts in Indiana\nWhere it's expensive and this bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent in since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars in sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect out of jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour\n[laughter] watch fit into that so there's still says a large percentage of each vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what companies do when we just got pushed up all sometimes yes they hire more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw afterward and more robots more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly take 'em all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know not all off the table and it's a little confusing let's hear and what's not yeah\nSo right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those or\nStation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly this doesn't take up all of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table um it's a little confusing what's here and what's not yet\nSo right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican still still subject to that and it's more it's complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration on that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd filing is interested in here in D.C today what are the chances that song gets approved by Congress well good\nLuck with your predicting a vote on this time next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats convertible took the house rights and historically Democrats had been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history questionable yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that says mentioned on there\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the

welcome back\nThankfully be glad to be here All right so based on what you know so far hum how does this deal look\nI'm so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taken away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think that people around you um are you know X handling a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important market for us agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and\nUh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico had established to tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you're on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year as that ship friday sale\nThink we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good movement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were imposed\nThat movement slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there and\nWe're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know

again or are there differences that you see I mean how does this plan for you on the ground is at the same thing with a different name\nIt does kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us in our businesses\nUm both hops in Apple's this looks a lot like a what we've had less fears and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nI think we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe\nMexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and
