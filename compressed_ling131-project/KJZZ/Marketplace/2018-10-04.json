something like that happening again\nYeah you should never be satisfied and I think I'm more explained that\nThe regular should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap\nI give you just do leeman redux it wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty but because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more

you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we planned for both not being exactly what you expect it so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like China can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\n... jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get to ... but but look let me back you up for me on the healthy account and I'm not going to argue that the headline facts right jobs GDP all of that good stuff\nBut as you said are on the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen them do what I mean I I I went to it but the good in the back yard so far so good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all all of the food water energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities that why is the capital markets and yes it can be quite a real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to it the economy's been going in Munich early and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but law and there are fixes the America\nWell all of the food water energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and

early and it's ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but law and the architects of the American post you know that everything we talk about their or fixes for be put her mind to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it all I appreciate the positivity generally I Do if there was some reality are right\nWe have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago\nIt is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy where where's the way have slipping a bit so that we have not had war with Canada and Mexico says Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's accident quite well and we should treat them very respectfully\nBut you're actually correct this trade issue a medical skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish does it sure doesn't look like anybody back into that look we devised a president that while you were young while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of CEOs have done it and I'm most was said\nThat we understand the issue to China and he's right non tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day that

problems so she'll put on your your most objective Jamie\nDiamond self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nI don't think so I mean there are all in a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and they're a lot of other big banks still on the I I'm going to be confused when the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money they were worth more than ... there's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do they have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they showed their find your Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also proud to compete when they were alley pay and we chat ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're going have competitors I Want Jake more chase to be the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would I think it'd be a mistake for America the best things in the world and the biggest banks in the
