that the Senate seats are all individual state wide elections\nAnd um it's a landscape that is difficult for Democrats um it is a ... it's going to be a state by state results um it's a little bit difficult for the Democrats to take control of the Senate everybody knew that it was going to be very hard this year\nIt'll sort of fun to look the Democrats are clearly against something most officer Donald Trump took people are less clear about what their full\n[laughter] I I Do think that that's a very good point because it seems to be easier this year to motivate people on the basis of fear

satisfaction which is a strange thing for American politics where historically the sunnier happier politician tends to win\nOr what but but what we see here is Democrats are obviously fearful of

conservatives seat on the court so they now have a clear majority they're\nOn and and how long can you keep them interested had not been confirmed I think Republican and Susan yet as them would have\nContinued and perhaps even grown over the next month the fact that he is confirmed seems the only way you can make them fearful is to make the argument that if the Democrats take control they will teach Brett Kavanaugh I'm so to try to keep that concern that fear\nAt the top of people's minds is one way of making sure that Republicans stay committed um again I I think we can say much more about this in a week or two when we see how opinion has changed now that Kavanaugh is on the court\nSaid thank you very much for coming on a couch in front of reaching leading expert in public opinion
