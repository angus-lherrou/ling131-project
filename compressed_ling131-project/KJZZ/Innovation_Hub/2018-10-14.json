to listen to this\nOnly need Chad [noise]\nI'm shining background we can't\n[noise] only way we can and\nThis is a song about corruption which is a move your next book which is about corruption sure\nUm so my first book titled bug bought was a an anti corruption children's book\nAnd the sequel ... which is coming out hopefully by the end of this year is about integrity so whereas the first book teach his children how not to be corrupt the second book jot it which means truthfulness honesty and integrity and my mother's bathroom language in Liberia\nI Want to know if people were delighted I remember being at the at the train station when they were coming in and people were applauding them as it came off the train but a lot of people really weren't very happy about it\nAnd so at it because of the politics of the the main parties people have been moving over to seek other alternatives and you have people who are very unhappy about immigration is she going to the far right parties ... very and on the immigration and on on the mark on one side\nAnd and [noise] and you are the there's the other alternatives in Bavaria there's also another uh spend her party fun to see us you just hire they know\nThey're not quite as as as radical has the um our state and other people are going there\nBut you also have people who in the middle who feel disenfranchised by the sea su so they are also a they're going further left they've gone and massively to the greens and the greens actually stand in this election to be the big winners are that are currently at about Nineteen Eighteen Nineteen percent in the polls and they could be the second\nThey're not quite as as as radical has the um our state and a lot of people are going there\nBut you also have people who in the middle who feel disenfranchised by the sea su so they are also a they're going further left they've gone and massively to the greens and the greens actually signed in this election to be the big winners\nAre there are currently to Nineteen Eighteen Nineteen percent in the polls and they could be the second strongest party in Bavaria for the first time\nRunner I can you wanted to jump ship I was just such a speaking to the very end friend in Germany a couple of days ago and she ... about the rise the greens but she said this is not the green both of you know your decision or the old foreign minister from ten years ago the rub the sort of ... this is the role of them will Rogers cool fundamentalist type of green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I I Would have actually it's often difficult differently the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders are they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd um they're they're at their pro you know they're\nAt on the racist I mean at and they're part of a large movement in Germany I mean there was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday to uh you know for tolerance they expect forty thousand people to turn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up\nThey're they're pro tolerance there pro environment you know pro was sort of a you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people are more interested in that kind of humane politics I've also heard people say you know I didn't mean that they see us use for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they are they missed the humane policy and politics that used to be in those parties\nWhich interest in using it or the migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\nAnd\nI think a lot of people that are more interested in that kind of the main politics I've also heard people say you know at that mean that they see us you've had for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they are they missed the humane policy and politics that used to be in those parties\nIt's interesting isn't it though the migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\nAnd well it's because that migration has as since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country\nDivided the way people think there are a lot of people who don't want people coming in in order to people who aren't doing very well particularly pensioners this is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money so they\nThey're also worried about a loss of and their their sense of German ... see no their culture and they're afraid at part of the thing that the ... say they're against and immigration\nParticularly from Islamic countries and that this is a theme with a lot of people who are worried about the uh\nThe flavor and that caller on the sense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope show\nJust looking back to that report from James no country from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows sticking with this topic of immigration but the last speaker was George ... founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant well she will take on that\nI did I thought it was particularly ridiculous I mean quite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls in detention to ensure\nHispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant what's your take on that I did I thought it was\nParticularly ridiculous I mean\nQuite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative and um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls and detentions to ensure that those people from across in Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border controls high borders detentions actually create more climbed a sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to smugglers\nSo you're essentially what you're doing is you're giving smugglers and people who engage in class time forms of migration I'm an income\nUm and and you're creating an opportunity for migrants to some to be more danger\nUm so I just I just found that it was quite interesting that this you know I'm Latino Republican so harsh\nAbout migrants coming from from Mexico when in actuality that's the same rhetoric the same race is sort of xenophobia grabbing rhetoric that Donald Trump has enabled across across the United states I don't know why does not happen\nBecause you you'll rush I've heard this perspective before why would someone with it you to ... an understanding of the issues that immigrants face what why would they moved to the ... I think what's\nInteresting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a you know notions across the globe have done a fund I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this us and us and them kind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because the senses you know there's a finite set of resources that we need to really\nI feel at Smith thanks for listing decay Jay Z's audio service which is supported by the UAE Eller College of management offering evening an online MBA options and the number one executive m._b._a. program at Arizona wrecked by world university rankings details Eller MBA dot Arizona dot edu\nUm because the offenses you know there's a finite set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who look like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who can't have migraine ... inches which for me it's very warm psychologically that's that's the way of the world's\nWrote them is it your professor of history and politics of modern China just how big an issue is immigration and China will\nThe really big issue there is no immigration the sense of people from outside China coming in but internal migration something like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the size of more than most European countries\nEssentially moved from their home villages throughout China to build buildings Welk on high speed railways and essentially provide the labor ... China but those people are often not properly documented they can't claim for welfare pensioner education rights\nFor their children and that's where the single biggest problems facing chimes today the question of poor people wanted to move to where the money is\nThe city's weekend from the b._b._c.

pricing I'm mostly from point for multinationals and you have you know the the wiki leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of of corrupt practices\nUm and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index\nWhich is more evidence base has more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be Transparency International should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption\nRona you mentioned corruption in Africa or the other the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that was what you mean China that sorry I didn't mean to you know I think\nOne of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days has been one of the series of high profile arrest this time among whom way who was the head of into polish to being picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery\nAn innocence what China's been doing particularly the last year will say with the setting up with something called the national supervision commission is what you might call auntie transparency there's this huge crackdown but it's very much the product\nOf ... state very little openness about what's going on you can be held on the up to six months I think without access to a lawyer and especially be putting the frightened there's a large numbers of well off people looked just officials but movie stars even say Chinese movie star who was\nA hidden away

people not just officials but movie stars even the same Chinese movie star who was and hidden away for three months until she came out in the great ... tax\nI'm Wondering what the effectiveness actually ease of this kind of very state driven very or for worse Terry and kind of anti corruption move and whether or not it's terrifying but effective or actually if it's just simply the wrong way to go to\nCasey well from my site or I I think in part to our atmosphere Casey this is about ... can you hear me just try again yeah a\nA ... international called ... that the national supervision finishing the systematic threat to the human rights in China which we agree with that the\nPeople without trial without access to a lawyer for six months for having an organization that you can't appeal for higher than the Supreme Court is probably not the way to go ... could you want to kind of the other hand I'm\nSorry I think ... a little cut off here\nYeah it it it's not the best I I I was a question for all of you um and in fact rubbed till\nWe have so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of the United states the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world does it work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there is a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer uprising or illicit financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout um but I think there is a way to fight\nPay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world don't work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there's a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer pricing or lift the financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment\nI think those will serve as the parent beyond just moving around the changing the practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe\nSo that people really face the full weight of the long\nRun up and I think it's very important that liberal governments exercise that kind of transparency in Sandy corruption because if you don't have that kind of effect of anti corruption it opens up the\nUh the waterfront for countries like China to say well actually our anti liberal and in many ways very known transparent ways cracking down on corruption a more effective and the liberal will have to have an answer to that\nWe're having all sorts of trouble with the lines of you and a half to say goodbye to our friends from Amnesty International there are sort of a newspaper article written that you've written a in front of me here and this is well this is corruption on a major scale by a movie star in China just tell me a\n... it's in this morning's London Sunday Times and it's basically about funding being the single most famous movie style celebrity in China sixty million followers on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter\nAnd she said she disappeared in July ... only three months later and

so it's by no means transparent but there is a sign out there in China at the moment that state Austin patients wealth shutting off your wealth is no longer perhaps in fashion and that's linked with the anti corruption movement\nRupture lost on this point if you have to sum up in ... seconds we do have a lot of ... young listeners on the b._b._c. World Service ... is a one point that if you're trying to say why not to be corrupt the young person what is the most important thing\nI think corruption I'm Still the way from basic social services so what could be used for health care what can be used for education again to educate the next leaders across the globe um are use for their dubious means and so I think young people across the globe have\nA stake and ... and ensuring that their resources um are not squandered off by people who may be incredibly powerful who may be rich and wealthy already um so we all have a role to play in young people particularly can change the practice of corruption\nMuch more than they may be able to change the policies\nRun that will come back to you show three this is the b._b._c.
