'cause\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single use plastics probably makes pretty good sense\nBut getting rid of all I don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation because they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more harm the environment because in in the nature of the way you use\n[noise] Peter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the union but University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make of that ...\n[laughter] I understand why he's saying about it\nThe legislation maybe circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more on the environment because in in the nature of the way you\nPeter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the university University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make a ...\nI understand why he's saying about having to look at the energy footprint of alternatives but I Do think that environmental degradation on climate change that we're seeing in the world today is such a pressing issue and we need\nSweeping um urgent action at scale on this\nAnd of course looking at plastic is not new um we've seen plastic bags being banned on the African continent for example in Rwanda Kenya march ... and Morocco\nAnd of course across the world ... taxes on plastic bags um I think it's a very welcome development my slights um reservation is around the bottom plastic strollers in particular\nAnd I've been reading the concerns from disability rights ... campaign is about this and who talk about how many people with disabilities need plastics jaws um in order to be able to drink liquids\nAnd how to use metal ones opaque well I well actually other materials such as paper on mental a glass of silicon don't necessarily what so many people can be allergic to them they can cause injury\nAnd that can be choking hazards metal for example is not safe for hot liquids and paper said dissolves with repeat the juice um so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ban on plastic strollers\nUm but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's a welcome to them\nMany people can be allergic to them they can cause injury and that can be choking hazards metal for example is not safe for hot liquids and paid petted dissolves with repeat to use\nAnd so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ... plastic strollers um but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's it's a welcome development and I also like to look not just a single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's in the oceans as well\nSo I was really struck by the high proportion\nOf plastic in in the oceans that's due to fishing I think twenty seven percent of the ... on a beach is from that and and I'd like to look at that as well as um clean up as well as prevention\nMatthew I Know this is an issue close to your heart's it's a civil liberties issue I think is is won't stop boils down to the Peter Morici into view that people should be free to the environment if they want\n[noise] ... well ... and I guess every time we come from the supermarket Laden with a huge pile of plastic packaging we're making our contribution to that site I think for those of us who are extremely concerned about is a huge she very refreshing to hear\nA political liberal politicians an on any political institutions in Europe taking strong action on this um but there's things sort of a ground breaking it will will cry yeah it is it's it's a directive at this age is not yet lure of course but hopefully it will lead to\nLegislation which will force industry to change 'em but there's also things we can do as well I don't know if you've come across IQ or bricks\nUsing incredible innovation that's being used by ... yeah that's right it's it's they're being used in South Africa or in parts of Southeast Asia where essentially you take your plastic ball for robbing them for being in a way you fill it up\nVery you you you you packet very densely with other pieces of plastic\nLegislation which will force industry to change 'em but there's also things we can do as well I don't know if you've come across ... brakes these in incredible innovation that's being used plastic both ... yeah that's right it's it's they're being used in South Africa or in parts of Southeast Asia or essentially you take your plastic both of them for being in a way you fill it up\nVery you you you you pack it very densely with other pieces of plastic a waste that you would normally have just jumped in the band\nAnd gradually you get a very solid piece of building material it if you can get it to the right place can be used to create a structure that's going to stand there for a thousand years so I was like saying we need to do feature [laughter] yeah that's an idea that's a lesson I did but\nBut yeah I mean it's a way to sequester the plastic take it out of the environment without even having to
