[noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in loser and county who\nYou know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nA what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the practice job candidate says something in the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you're really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric understandable [noise]\nWhat about religion this is a place that is very Catholic\nSaid well that's the press his job candidate says something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise] what about\nReligion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising are evangelical population\nTrump's um evangelical vote was off the charts you carry a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction ...\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nAnd that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty eight teen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty eight teen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there are also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area the opioid\nCrisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I drew the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and just trying to raise public awareness\nAbout it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and uh working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nBy in his first eight years there's only going up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care about\nWhat about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really\nCare and the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over or anything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like lives there and county well they certainly did and\nWith the twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats what other people that I talked to were Democrats a but felt that the party had left them rather than be leaving the party\nI look at the week in politics with here and now is Republican and democratic strategist is

Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students said it smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\nThat'd be ... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts\n[noise] um I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful [noise] talk about what is happening\nTensions and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book in the chapter calls why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise]\nIt seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening one of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty\nThey start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular are more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girls and having space to talk about that is not\nA bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing the stereotypes that we see of\nBlack women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that\nSure well if I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because\nOr send in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said\nYou know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like than you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why\nIt's such a vicious cycle because very often the kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is in a sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in\nAnd in fact tracking often does result in re segregation with in racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper attracts you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours\nIn your book but to read that was pretty amazing\nPaired and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper attracts you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nBut to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores that still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nTo the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counsel for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools\nAre black or Latino and often there's this sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs\nLook at the performance of the black kids in particular they often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not ... but you write another anecdote about\nA young girl who was in a school a majority white\nThe teacher was saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to see how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we lived in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance that she then ends up saying something\nThere's also may not ... but you write another anecdote about\nA young girl who was in a school a majority white and the teacher was saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to see how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we lived in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like that there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluate it how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically\nAnd also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class or if something happened in ...\nHappened I'm at the kids said they felt more supported they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say there's an example that one of the kids provided in this study\nUm they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era and some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting\nAnd so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about a debrief it's soda so to speak in that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful\nBut anyway the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria nobody ever asked why the white kids in the cafeteria their bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students were more likely to be racially isolated\nOh just a luxury you bought and sold on consignment as a recession proof business model\nThat it will get mark ... and you have a big market and

she's made it her vow her sworn duty to overturn the prevailing miss about Robbins her new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when the lesser welcome thank you for having me Robyn just you know thinking of the west Side Story scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou write it too but I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because Jerome Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing of\nThem in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches\nDug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer Isaac\nOlivia fabulous well so how does this all start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the one hundreds centennial of Jerome Robbins birth\nCertainly knew about his work says we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about\nHad certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University press is Jewish lives series for the hundreds centennial until Robin ... birth certainly knew about his works as we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the journal Robbins Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course music from Bach let's just listen to them\n[noise]\n\nOkay so you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see\nThat that really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story fleet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say\nThat had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done right and you even\nIt had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because he was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nDeborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crow Jay had panned and that she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nAh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called Jerome Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you are going up from Robbins words as a ballet choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of uh again the pieces and we will have as much visual as we can hear another word afternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of DC I'm willing to the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina tend to feel a click tiny\nRobbins muse and dear friend\nIt's worth as a ballet choreographer and so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much visual as we can hear now that the word\nAfternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of DC I'm willing to do the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina tend to feel a click penny\nRobbins muse and dear friend [noise] and this is a year before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\n\n\n\nHow long is this a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise] well I I just loved the stamps and it's only about ten minutes\nTwelve minutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful Everytime [noise] it's not just\nA reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has a priest is is dancing around them and stuff but he's practically a solar\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a ...\nWonderful to ... I think we're at simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fun and his dream girl who\nComes in visit him and with those two dancers tend to kill the clip and Jack Kemp was it was a knockout and what are they\nThey're like they're watching themselves in a practice mirrors\nThat is what it feels like and we are the mere they're looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in the mirror as\nDancers sometimes do in a studio so that there's this weird feeling of we're spying on them in a way\nAnd with those two dancers tend to kill the ... and ... was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves into practice mirrors\nThat is what it feels like and we are the mirror there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking at him near as dancers sometimes you do in the studio so that there's this weird feeling of we're spying on them anyway\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude toward things that had applied he was balancing loved dancers at a gathering which Robbins made and down she said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said he's like you could eat it the whole thing endlessly\nPopcorn and that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but let me ask you a little dances at a gathering this is a the dance Robin ... to Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nHe had been away from the New York city ballet doing choreography\nFor Broadway but this cancer that a gathering was an instant hit [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day\nDance in the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise]\nTouching the stage after many many minutes at a you know quite a long ballet of all the dancers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside watching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon of us on\nA combination of\nAll the dancers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside watching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon of us on\nA combination of\nA work that's meant for us and that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n[noise] uh you talked about his childhood which was difficult fraught relationship with his mother um and he became difficult there's a famous and encircle story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal you know he has his back to the audience\nThe valley freeways right now eastbound ITN we've got a crash inside the deck park tunneled at Central avenue\nWell gauging as easy as your source for Arizona election coverage in tonight at seven it's alive congressional district in three debates we'll hear from Democrat role ...

Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November twenty sixteen\nAt the appropriate time I will bluish though but right now I'm under routine order nobody cares still or cares is you know you and a few people that us they question obviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress\nMinutes after he was elected in November twenty sixteen\nAt the appropriate time I will release them like right now under routine nobody cares still and cares is you know you and a few people that as the question obviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German and ways and means just stopped delaying and yet Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner\nUm but he can appoint agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request\nAnd to be very clear on what the legislative purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both\nSignificance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house is not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtain drew the full house or the full Senate and presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote the committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would uh say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because uh the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because uh the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also rated the possibility of fraud in that story yes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly\nIt's doing and why it searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns yeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances or the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress in the early Nineteen twenties\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances or the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress in the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials\nAre the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the present it and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nAh there was a similar concern or about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nAh the the the Coolidge administration that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing industry ration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that\nObviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind ah the the the Coolidge administrators from that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing industry should push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses\nYou know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already have\nDo you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them well that's\nA tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think of some policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut it gives President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character is simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be [noise]\nAccess for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more as in terms of character simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be fairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake Perry is a relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the decisions and is there some personal or business interest on the part of some of the decision making going on\nI Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that well that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "17"}
