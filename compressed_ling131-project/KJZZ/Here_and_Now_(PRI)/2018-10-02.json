executive free comedy which is why it's any good and you know we we don't always towards the strange show\nWhich we had done lots of other shows aren't we knew one has to be different from all over the other shows where you worked on\nWell there was this incredible bursts of comedy shows in England and we felt that many times to John Cleese a boy he will go on any show will he not\nWell it's the whole divorce thing Alibis mean divorced years ago this is just he likes the money he once told me all we're not trying to use he should be do anything for money so I offered him a quick to shut up

really hit I ever saw who actually attracts a prime minister all the cabinet solar queen and they're all family or the ... the army the navy religion and they just demolished everything and I just thought oh my gosh you can be funny about all this stuff\nYeah well I'm thinking too that yours was the generation postwar horrific horse and now you had a laugh we ... we were\nBorn in the war and then we grew up in the fifties which was a time in England weather was rationing of everything a back to ... beef so those right great shortages London was filled with bombs science everything was blitzed and horrible\nWhat was interesting is that that generation that's they matured and became teenagers invented everything rock and roll photographers became one for the photographer you there was ... because there was nobody else there\nYou know they they don't have been in the army or just coming home so that wasn't anybody ahead of us so in a way that was a wonderful blank canvas and we got really lucky because they were saying oh you're just like not shall we had three years ago there wasn't the shirts or years ago\nLet's talk about some of the work wink wink nudge nudge to guys in a pub one being really kind of creepy frankly that you um sailing up to the other one asking him you know probably a question about his wife and stuff and done yeah liquor\nIs you'll walk I I Know

Smith who uh forward says was there\nA it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which\nAh he and his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which a that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which an incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer which is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ...\nCountry have you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that refers to flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you have the same meaning or with flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence a sixteen year book page\nOn 'em game ... Philip bump that's not what proved means well it's sort of\nUnclear what booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely but\nIt seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious that a reference to drinking there was\nWell it's sort of unclear one booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty wisely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right they reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nWell and just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says that moved refers to anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term as your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n\nDrinking game has played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYour plate quarters you know okay so ...\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups of range and to try and go the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this is this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of a suggestion is about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search\nOR Books that they have indexed I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports you know news for like\nOf the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this is this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of uh of suggestions about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search a books that they have indexed I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports\nYou know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically a but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says that a devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had me\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabinet and his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened if\nYou're asking about yeah blackout I don't know as you\nCan you answer the question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking nor do I okay thank you so Chad\n... who's a former classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking ah\nI I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot to\nThank you so Chad ... who's a former yell classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking\nA ... I I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank they're often times in which he appeared to be in the past hated\nAh and there are lots of suggestions or from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and they'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point\nIf it was the case that he with some regularity in high school or gotten jumped to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence\nThe story that he says which is that he doesn't he never I I did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event for happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to the senator's this is a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS if\nJudge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes I Would think so\nSo they're they're both saying that that line to the committee would be a problem ... how how is this all playing out a among the people that you're talking to at\nThis point well ...\nOne of the move sort of fascinating things here is the extent to which the sort of obvious white lies\nNomination job or are you ask them\nTo the they're both saying that that line to the committee would be a problem ... how how is this all playing out a among the people that you're talking to at this point well\nThis is one of the blue sort of fascinating things here is the extent to which the sort of obvious white lies of him\nOr trying to downplay for example as your book injuries are sort of given a password sort of established as odd spectrum of these sorts of false words that are are going to be considered\nBig storms like Hurricane Florence government men made money on beach in\nNorth Carolina the government has that more than eight hundred million dollars cumulatively to rehash the beaches and then said\nI'm Lizzie O'Leary which they just don't and ended up ... look at how property values determined to get some money next time on my side\nWe've got all the day's business news tonight at six on marketplace in at six thirty in the world business report\nSupported this program is drawn to you bye Janet from Phoenix center donation of two thousand four jeep liberty to support all things considered you could donate your vehicle to by visiting cars dot ... dot org and thinks it's twelve noon\nHere and now comes from that for the greater the law to simulate somewhere accelerating the pace of engineering and science and learn more men were not come\nFrom NPR and W.

University Larry Summers walking back to her now\nGlad to be with Germany and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it\nNever seen so

important domestic challenges facing the United states\nAnd the important international challenges but I'm happy with the new agreement put simply because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are tiny compared to the overall economy\nThe ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians\nAnd the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits the

short sighted of strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China\nTrading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used\nTo go after them have been quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government they encourage the Chinese sauna road\nTo self sufficiency and independence from the United states which ultimately will reduce our leveraging influence they fail to mobilize the moral and political force\nOf the entire international community which has surely the most effective way to influence Chinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about\nChinese trade practices and in particular ones relating to intellectual property but I don't think\nThe strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize\nRun American interests and what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China\nAn intellectual property but I don't think the strategy or that tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China they're all\nKinds of ways of raising taxes if you want\nTariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs that companies need\nIn order to compete that's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient and so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on\nCutting the taxes for corporations\nAnd raising the taxes\nOn uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas so are you surprised\nThen that Republicans who have long campaigned on being taxed cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican\nCraven this in front of President Trump is clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist\nBuddy it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge sponsored and supported by President Trump and President Trump may not\nIt is clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist\nBut it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge sponsored and supported by President Trump and President Trump may not have a majority within America\nWith him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline and therefore he is able to a\nRally Republican congressmen and senators who value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions to stand by his side you know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion\nBut John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage\nAbout senators who were guarded their\nCore beliefs\nAs being more important to them than their reelection I just wish we were seeing more profiles in courage or in the Senate these days on trade issues and frankly on some other issues as well [noise]\nWhat do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to recognize that any error and letting inflation rise a little bit\nWell what do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to recognize that any error and letting inflation rise a little bit too much\nIs likely to be a reversible error at any error in terms of tipping economy into recession is likely to take a very long time to reverse\nI'm One who believes that we have a very different autonomy than we used to therefore I think the approach that's being pursued is\nOkay and I would not be one or to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do\nI I have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry at a major bank and and he was saying\nThat the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nIt's possible uh there is some evidence that\nAt the end of expansions there's a tendency for productivity growth to slow\nAnd that may be for the reason you're a companion suggests\nThat ah when laborers in short supply some of the people hire are a bit less a qualified but it seems to me that what is striking is how slow any pressure for inflation is and\nPerhaps that's because of the

sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent out all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let Scott ... he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome I thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete adding the what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a ... change your lives you moved you\nStarted saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on the podcast that was very interesting to me\nAt that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the ... nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was was there that kind of escalation going on\nExactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nIn our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older ah and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves up moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going\nApartment in this little beach town and our our costs are much lower than and you know as we got older and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know the honest to\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as what was so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes or I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that is what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really liked my job and it for me it's not about work for me it was about offspring myself from\nThis idea of mandatory labor you know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOkay sell ... first of all when you say this mandatory\nFor me it's not about work for me it was about a ring myself from\nThis idea of mandatory labor you know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what'd you and your wife did just to keep the story going is it's a major part of this fire moving it's called arbitrage you move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now\nBut I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replace your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant truth that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retire doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels uh this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal\nFat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest ... to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance but the infamous yeah yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people decided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough that the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that\nYou work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance but the and stuff yeah yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough\nThat the whole goal was not to make too big footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game and have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different you know and then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race is\nOne of the the main roles for me was\nThe ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds and how much money you could save by not having a financial advisor you're essentially betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big dips and dives\nAnd if you can ride those waves if you can ride those lows and you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a an entry point for me well\nIn part of this in order to do this as a sort of a goal in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you were absolutely miserable and we'd go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nBut some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable with some of the things you were doing\nYeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah\nAnd we go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable what were some of the things you were doing\n[laughter] yeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for your we we actually uh we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter\nAnd we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents' house maybe it was a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we're living in the air and space and\nBy the way people have pointed out this isn't something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work in an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it's just so here you are doing this\nAnd I've been hearing of people doing fire we'd like one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems that's a lot of money but you're potentially going to live Seventy more years [noise] I mean have you ever thought about that\nOf course we definitely thought about that and that's something that you know we were definitely a nervous about an ass a lot about in the beginning and there's a couple of things without it I think the first\nDoing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire we'd like one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems a lot of money but you're potentially going to live Seventy more years [noise] I mean have you ever thought about that\nOf course we definitely thought about that and that's something that you know we were definitely a nervous about an ass a lot about in the beginning\nAnd there was a couple of things without it I think the first thing is the whole premise of financial independence and your investments making enough that it can sustain you is based off of this thing called the trinity study and it essentially a works
