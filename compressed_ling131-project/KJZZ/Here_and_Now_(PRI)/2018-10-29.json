own noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak Rosen is president of the American Jewish Congress\nJak words fail you know we're so sorry about this room to community\nBut has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tech not only the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was\nJews have been living in America is comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country she changed since the fifties and sixties and and they posted Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities and here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in over\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred Jews make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the country's religious hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous year have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols of long Jewish cemeteries schools the SAT\nPopulation the FBI data says they account for about half the country's religious hate crimes according to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we see more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on Jewish cemeteries schools the SAT on Saturday is quite a shock to the community and to America it seems\nAnd you know we already saw the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize ... political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any major changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe as those\nThat have had been spewing out some of his viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this you're a political leaders they have the microphones most important political leaders our president is a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing that\nIt was who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this you're a political leaders they have the microphones and most important political leaders our president is a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from both parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are met governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize be a little loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the to the polls is necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell uh actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president have been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August of twenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear but let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSounds on the documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in the synagogue that had to be chilling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are already\n\nIt sounds on a documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly accounting and God that had to be tailing\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of\nThe wrong tone being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of you know his views and his political rhetoric we should all work hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to been watching Clinton sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nShocked to see a\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you the wrong tone has been sending you said to myself what about ...\n... you're speaking of ... leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and\nTrump's Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against you know hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold the president did a little more responsible\nYou know he has to since he has the biggest microphone she's going to have to uh you know live with the fact that\nHe's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nOr in the mail ... said that they were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville and you got permission half as much and I don't think that you you can\nSo he has the biggest microphone just going to have\nA you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nHere in the mail President Trump said that there were find people on both sides in Charlottesville and some permission effort as much as\nI don't think that you you talk about Nazis and the old right and Americans I just don't think the comparison like you know any sense to us Americans\nCat goes in President as American Jews Congress thanks so much and again set aside for the loss in your community\nThank you for your kind of thoughts appreciate the time to be able to express their views of the Jewish community\n\nWell immigration officials are processing

this day when many people are morning we thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut cigarettes Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide and it's also about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together to even spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in nonprofit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part time controller dot com\nAlways loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve [noise]\nWe do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him and she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that and draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dogs see this\nWell she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll\nNow I remember I had to put a little dog to sleep once and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dogs see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought well that seems odd but\nI Am such meat yeah cats you can't say for sure that that would happen well\nWhen the when the shots started the injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they and then he did more afterwards\nOr as I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have thought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean this whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say that something happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog because you presume it's like old yell or your resume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life would be thinking\nThere she has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of that is a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asked her to party are near the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of it\nWith your narrator to other parts of her life thinking there\nShe has a life outside the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asked me to party argue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle them but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google as I should Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties and California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties the dog is listening buddies\nTrue that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen\nAnd to the child is having reading difficulties the dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nOr it could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married her really does this is something I definitely share with my married or she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that into our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter]\nDon't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs you know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that into a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nYeah dogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that she is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone\nOh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it I didn't have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle the story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it\nAnd that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nI say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among students spoiled at least in a draft because they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really

became the second leading cause of death the Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving as CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years\nWe'll have a form of mental health education the law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death the Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans are best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for a national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of the idea of therapy and mental health being on the table than let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York\nVersus another part of the state but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place doing also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look in and see that there are\nLesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school and to high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people are here now doubt or the great lakes sample like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum ... and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school especially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any\nA specific part of a curriculum day and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's ah got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nThat emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people\nLive with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment so this night also funnel people to real treatment as opposed to education\nAnd if you noticed opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health\nWhat we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's when Lehman he's the CEOs and nonprofit mental health association and the state where did the groups that advocated for the new law that it's just going to affect the

want to say that\nOf course throughout our history painters have been screwing around with light is Whitney curator Kim ... points out\nActually her practice has to do with something that painters have been thinking about for centuries think back to an artist like car garage into the Italian broke period trying to figure out how do you capture the ephemeral qualities of light something that surround us every day it's kind of phenomenon\nHow does that translate into paint and how does that translate onto the surface\nMary courses been wrestling with that cannot drums since early twenties at one point she was experimenting with light as part of the work first using fluorescent lights and later the more subtle radiance are gone\nStill for older experimentation she was pretty much kept out of the big boys club of Los Angeles art in the Nineteen sixties as the consensus of the time was the painting was dead concepts we're in the men were he men and women artist were pretty much ignored\nI was younger than everybody else so I was still really a girl I was in my twenties so maybe that had something I figured that has much to do with it as being a woman but I've also been in
