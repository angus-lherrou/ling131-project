debate over immigration many California cities have taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement\nIf if you quote unquote broke the law by coming to this country to work where there was a work of plenty that's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nOr by voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice\nThis is really about rule of law and about to local control\nThis year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities the law sb fifty four is called the California values act it's also known as the sanctuary law and has drawn lawsuits from the Trump Administration in several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alamos which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union was telling me to city manager Troy Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nYou look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue how do you respond\nDetroit Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue how do you respond\nTo some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or a sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around loose telling me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by the sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on in the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um\nI probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran she came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait and turned to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything\nAnything to do with racism um\nI probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran she came when the shah was overthrown she is a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait and turned to get into the United states and so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I'm actually I'm with my wife as an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with Las Alameda in defined the state law\nMarches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest high he says the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and it's a public safety issue it just ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I've met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing those\nDetails says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle\nUp here in our agents are the ones that help\nThe immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or that we're talking about criminal organizations that are doing those\nDetails says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed it sanctuary law\nDivvied been a few days is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of ... and has about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our residents\nThat they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and at the stadiums here to serve them well we we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that is not about racism why um why I'm doing this\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is a frankly a pretty\nA response there was no need for the city will selling me to take the position that they did other than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city\nThere was no need for the city of selling me to take the position that they did other than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope\nAnd we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what\nThat he\nIs a liar and has no idea\nUh about the laws and and the law of the land he oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city's downtown I Believe that any violent criminal should be ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you're only crime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family that is not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to\nArrest somebody for so what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is a slap certainly when we do here that's not what my mandate is tomorrow officers um we responded behaviors respond to criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from ice state makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so federal authorities um\nAre you know they they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law uh we do not and\nThis is not certainly will we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers um we responded ... responded criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from I say it makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so federal authorities\nUm are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law\nUh we do not and so it's like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law and the and and they do that so um the other pieces has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are they calling right\nSo um the ideas to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in and what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks that call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail system in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administer ration Bush Obama and now Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates at our custody for local crimes not for ice issues or here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place at the Tehran\nSo it isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can't communicate we release them back in the community\nAnd of that ten percent ice only really wants to about one percent of those individuals those are the ones they place it detain are on so it isn't everybody in our custody it's just that small population of inmates who ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can't communicate we release them back in the community\nJay Jay Z is supported by his shoes earth and space exploration day

Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters to approve of President Trump or so I mean do you want do you want that support do you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat\nLook it's a it's a bit of an oddity that's for sure and my values and my values and my values of the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education my mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to seek a better life so\nI'm as the author of sanctuary state

author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo ... and the grade my values have always been for working families in California and that's why and um my goal is to be a new voice for a California's in Washington DC and\nNow it's a it's an interesting auditing that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down the state of California doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice it's going to fight for them on issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if he becomes a senator from California\nWell I can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this was a man that was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity to our values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency or John Case tickets they even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nI'm either Democrat I'd be disappointed but I'd get over it in a couple of weeks and tried to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country a forward together um within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that I didn't fight from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can't allow one like tall aberration reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou've criticized Senator Feinstein over her hand\nUm within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that identified from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can allow one like tall aberration reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou've criticized Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of\nGross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner a Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated do you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a politics I don't support investigation of Senator Dianne Feinstein but I Would have taken a different approach to Brent Kavanaugh on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to his confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nAs Senator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man and a new partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation\nAnd I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's judicial nominees now these are as we know lifetime appointments and these are men who [noise] um oh surely will undo a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights a voting rights are environmental laws so [noise]\nUh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked ... what can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you we witness um junior senators such as ... Harris\nBrent senior senator from California what would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked what can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you we witness um junior senators such as ... Harris I'm Cory Booker I'm a ... senators Richard Blumenthal I'm and I'm\nA descended from Minnesota uh be very sort of a and actually make motions immediately four and a German obviously a delay tactic and\nUh I Would have followed suit as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee would have programmed with my colleagues and and they didn't seem to be any programming it was very disjointed and they I think a demonstrated a lack of leadership on a on behalf of the senior senator from California\nState you've alluded to this but let me ask you about it directly she is eighty five Senate or find say eighty five years old you're fifty one as a member of a younger generation what do you think that you can bring to the Senate that she cannot well\nLet me say this I don't think it's about age or ages them I I think it's about values and having the right representation to represent the most diverse in ... ah largest economy in the United states of America I think it's time that we have someone on the front lines and not on the sidelines and I think what California wants\nIs representation a representative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the existential threat that is before it's climate change\nTo fight for immigration reform and make sure that we stopped betraying the American born children uh and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's home to the largest number of immigrants in the country [noise]\nRepresentative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the existential threat that is before it's climate change\nTo fight for immigration reform and make sure that we stopped betraying the American born children are and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's home to the largest number of immigrants in the country\nYet we don't have that leadership or from California in Washington DC especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate so that seniority has not been working for California I think that's what they want in today's day and age when we have a president who occupies the White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity to our values and more importantly to our people to eat I think she is fighting for California [noise]\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country um I think that comedy um and this bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game or

basis sleeping in parks are asking for money on sidewalks and is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does salaries can't keep up with those market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nA there is historically been a lot of pushback against shelters and

the young people are much more diverse um Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting\nBut we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump now\nSo a number of people who didn't like him have come around partially because they didn't have another choice I think one of the reasons that\nI'm Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting but we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump now\nSo a number of people who didn't like him have come around partially because they didn't have another choice I think one of the reasons that I'm Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger\nOr and they had that experience of an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans wanted\nSo I think it was just that they had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country hadn't ...\nOrange County think President Obama\nCertainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight\nYears hating him pretty uh vehemently [noise] uh but um [noise]\nYou know it it wasn't because they loved Hillary and so what are Republicans hoping to do in the upcoming election\nSo Republicans are hoping to hold on\nYou know it's going to come down to three things it's a Trump\nIt's turnout and its taxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of Trump and I'm now I guess I've got to add the Kavanaugh factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out\nFor the Democrats to get all four of those seats um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think polls are really over estimating\nThe Democrats' chances of getting old for what are the Democrats need to do that the river\nSo the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big why [noise] um I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think\nSeats um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think polls are really over estimating the Democrats' chances of getting all for what are the Democrats need to do this do you ever\nSo the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big way um I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think she thousand in Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before not want the Republicans have all held elected office or are holding elected office so they've got experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust\nAnd right now Orange County I I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from\nWhen they have this
