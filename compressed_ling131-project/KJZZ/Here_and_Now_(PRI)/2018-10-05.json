and described to you and he's had with a far off looking as I Am this complete conflict that he has inside his his self that he that he survived but at what cost\nHe kept saying things like it you you may think we were selfish when we just ran\nUm because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left a father behind he said he was he was praying in his house he said we had seconds to to get out um and they were luckily on the street he looked up turns or saw wall of water coming at them\nAnd just ran it you know in some ways it's it's so serendipitous in miraculous that people survive these these sorts of events because this this uh sue nominee is coming at them like a locomotive and it's just building steam and it's building height and so I think it's a the personal stories um\nOf of people who whose lives are completely shattered you know there are a thousands tens of thousands of people whose livelihood has been destroyed\nThe economics of the city robbing are

what could possibly have gone wrong here and other areas that are completely\nOn on recognizable for example a church moved and entire over and over a mile it was moved by the churning earth below

just gobbling up houses and its weight they don't know\nHow many people are are are are lying beneath that that mountain mountain of mud is what I saw and so that will take a long time to to on earth and they don't have the equipment here to do it yet\nAnd that is part of the mystery of this place I mean it's really not knowing how many people perished\nNow we know a French rescuers were very frustrated they thought that with their equipment they heard signs of life under a four star hotel the collapse now they're thinking that that might have been a gas leak or something that they the there is no life there that you mentioned the lack of coordinated government response\nSo yeah long term recovery but what about you know tomorrow to people have food do they have water\nThey don't have food they don't have water there are scrounging for it and they're begging borrowing it on there are people coming in from the outside driving for hours to deliver aid um that said what you had I'm sort of amassing a edge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUh the b._b._c. ten or what's at stake in this election in Brazil\nOr for a lot of people do say that democracy is at stake and the reason they will say that particularly opponents of the man who is leading to the presidential campaign including the opinion polls that they said because he ... he's a fall right congressman who\nAs sort of sprung from ... ah he's a threat to the Democratic norms are in Brazil and this is just says he is remember from when there was admitted treat dictatorship here so will vote democracy is vibrancy in this country\nThat people don't take it for granted equally supporters of Mr ... and already said that they are the ones who are going to rescue Brazil's from the clutches\nOf the people who have been responsible for a surge in crime a surgeon corruption and the worst recession that the country has ever experience so they say that you know Brazil is under multiple threats\nIf the left gas and hence Europe's the rights to joke about polarized nation but also the language people use about what is at stake in this election could not be morph rules\nAnd we should also remember that two of the last few presidents or one of them is in jail right now the other was forced out of office\nYeah and that is ... ... depends a lot of the opposition to the main challenges to this fall right presidential candidate because the work is policy the P. T. to give it it's a\nPortuguese accident they would impact she's Houseman shoots two thousand and sixteen and uh\nForced out of office yeah and that is ... ... depends a lot of the opposition to the main challenges to this fall right presidential candidate because the work is policy the P.

until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series\nThis week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen and joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon hosting senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHey how you doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to tell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else do we know about her\nOh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist she lives in Henderson which is\nAnd let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen or a relative newcomer to politics compared to hell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else do we know better\nOh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist she lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college\nShe was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nColumn senators buying less because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada it ain't no\nYou're right now I cannot support the piece of legislation to ensure that we shouldn't be the most Americans are getting laid out his goes but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there but you're going to be held her focus\nPromise and voted for repeal deciding to stir how\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have seemed to be making I'm quite a mark here you know this\nPressure from his party leaders who the threat from President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there but they're going to be held her focus promise and voted for repeal deciding\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have\nSeemed to be making I'm quite a mark here you know this this was the vote about a year ago maybe a little bit more Heller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change the Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nOr just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue or what\nAbout Dean Heller um here's one of his dad's\nMy life I don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver stop\nTelling me what you're going to you and just doing\nDean Heller and get things done forty pieces of legislation to help our veterans parties to pass the violence against women act\nHow's delivered to victims of sexual assault Dean Heller is our voice our\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking in that had are women\nYeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen\nBy fourteen points over Heller fifty two to thirty percent that's a huge drop from the summer when ... was at about fifty percent with women\nWhat else do we know about ... other than this\nAll the people speaking in that had are women\nYeah that really really does stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the latest CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over Heller fifty two to thirty percent that's a huge drop from the summer when how it was at about fifty percent with women\n[noise] what else do we know about ... other than the fact that he sort of straddling between supporting his partying you know voting against his party occasionally\nYeah no that's really the kind of become a central issue although he until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote on reliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed you know reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called Heller and and and said you know or don't opposed Trump on this\nUm that's why the hell are seemed to change his vote and um they Adelson interned have given to his campaign war chest\nIs adults in a huge player still in Nevada politics\nHuge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest men in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need him on\nYour side in order to hold office there\n[noise] you know this this will be the ... election to see if that is the is the case\nI any sense of how the cabin or a nomination fight as playing with voters in Nevada\nWell one Heller said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a hiccup it did explode across the social\nOh yeah he's front and center you need him on your side in order to hold office there [noise] you know this this will be the ... election to see if that is the is the case or any sense of how the cabinet or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada\nWell when Heller said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a hiccup it did explode across the social media landscape here um\nAnd and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking a direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearings what", "year": "2018", "show_name":
