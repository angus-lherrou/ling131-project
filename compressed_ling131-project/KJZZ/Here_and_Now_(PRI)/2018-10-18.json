... it's here and now secretary of state Mike Pompeo said this morning that he wants to give the Saudis more time to finish investigating the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal ... before the

that continue to be important counterterrorism partner\nOr they have custody of the two holy sites are there and important strategic alliance of the United states so we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us now to talk about that as wrong as far as that host of the podcast full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S imports from Saudi Arabia\nLook that's about Thirteen billion dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a now about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments in the U.S shale patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nThese are the two biggest foreign holders of U.S government's securities they could if they wanted kind of hold us hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis they really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very

denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very threatened by too strong a dollar so it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars\nOf arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard this from a a fan of President Trump's evangelist Pat Robertson who spoke earlier this week on the seven hundred club\nWe've got an arm of the everybody on a piece of is

three deaths\nAnd Rodney or you're an hour north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we we took a direct hit the when it hit us it was right at a high cat three low cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people realized that they stole it does affect people that deep inland\nAnd when you've got a storm of this magnitude in movie as fast as it did it held together a lot better yeah and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you understand your home was hit\nYes it was it

a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and if it's the damage as it is just off the scales but and buildings down almost every tree has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that used to live here and come back so they don't recognize the town\nWell the county appraiser Carlin the cocktail the Tampa Bay to be in that she guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county were down and she's using tax rules an aerial pictures is that is that you sent\nA sense that we ... we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plush are completely destroy she's looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nSomeone with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had it's a rebuild of the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd that after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were tone do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to trim back those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting power alone\nDo you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you on a critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job\nAnd they have had very aggressive programs to trim back those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nWell what what are some of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just that was so much debris down they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped so they were not transmitting\nNow you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to find a study on storm response failed in the state legislature twenty Seventeen do you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level\nUm emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it is so much climate change as it is is just a natural process that occurs over the\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour\nThere's fifty show of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike I ask you run and just briefly um does they're all have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know is so much climate change is it is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their metal saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level it's not a question of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee this will change the climate among community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County in Mariana Florida we wish you the best\nCase thank you very much\nWell parts of the country

think they are an art form I have to pay our cookbooks pictures of pairs and all I Do is use them in salads we blue\nOkay well your whole pair world this is about to get blown out of the park and I'd say so I was writing okay well the most common one that we see in\nGrocery stores is that on Jew or mans you um there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green one which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that it's an incredibly versatile fruit and most of us\nWell the most common one that we see in grocery stores is that on Jew or and chew 'em there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green one which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Robert they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are some what if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian pair and I caught one up for you right there\nThey are very crunchy very tart\nSweet also these are best eaten raw\nTimmy and Asian pair tastes like a pair meeting with a water chestnut and it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juice scene is and wonderful and salads wonderful graded also\nBartlett another very common for riding very sweet red and green as well they are ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is that they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also boss pairs same deal\nVery earthy flavor and boss parents have any long gated neck which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have one of ... we did it seems so hard\nLower court judges before reassessing until the midterms\nBut now they say Republicans broke a promise regarding judicial nominees what's going on here\nWhat's going on here is that the Republican Party and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nHas made basically in a a bet that one of his significant and lasting accomplishments during their tenure is going to be the confirmation\nOf federal judges mostly young conservative white male federal judges to lifetime appointments on district courts and federal appeals courts around the country and these Republicans are not going to let things like the Senate recess stop them so yesterday they went ahead and held a hearing\nOf for six judicial nominees even though a Senator Dianne Feinstein a Democrat from California the top Democrat on the committee as you noted Jeremy was actually at home in California are preparing to debate her opponent because she's right\nOn district courts and federal appeals courts around the country\nAnd these Republicans are not going to let things like the Senate recess stop them so yesterday they went ahead and held a hearing of for six judicial nominees even though a Senator Dianne Feinstein a Democrat from California the top Democrat on the committee as you noted Jeremy\nWas actually at home in California you're preparing to debate her opponent because she's running for reelection other Democrats didn't show up either in fact very few Republicans actually showed up for this hearing a so the nominees got a very very light and round of questioning and moved along\nIs there anything Democrats can do to stop Republicans for doing this you\nKnow they can win elections Republicans control the White House and Donald Trump has been nominating these young conservatives for the federal bench and Republicans control the Senate which has the advice and consent function here so if Democrats really want to do something\nThey're going to need to win more elections now if you talk to\nA progressive advocates and activists out there they say that Democrats could have been firmer and standing up last week and not agreeing to this deal to confirm Fifteen federal judges before they left town for the recess\nOr there are some things on the margins that Democrats could do more of but by and large the Republicans hold the power here and they're using it\nAnd just give us a sense of what we missed yesterday who got through\nYes so then the main focus of yesterday's hearing was a young woman lawyer named Allison rushing she's been nominated to serve on the federal appeals court for the fourth circuit Jeremy\nShe has only thirty six years old she's one of the youngest people we have

absolutely that\nYou are has the fact that this has been an open border is something that's it's promoted commerce promoted good relations and again it's kept the peace the issue is though if the u._k.\nSteps out of the European Union as is the plan under breaks that there has to be a border somewhere and that's where they just can't agree on I mean the Europeans have taught or the email I should say has talked about\nDoing it in the Irish Sea the u._k. is talked about maybe having some of their of agencies and and and authorities handling the customs and the and the border controls and that's something that you doesn't want so there's just a lot of disagreement over exactly how to create a hard border but they do agree it shouldn't be between Northern Ireland and Ireland\nAnd and what about her sense that there's going to be an extension is everyone on board with that\nThis is interesting because a little later today after a Theresa May statement a Donald ... the president of
