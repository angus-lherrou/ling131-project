obviously is at the very early stage but what they are willing to say is there characteristics of these devices the one cent to Obama the wants them to Clinton and another that was also sent to the liberal financier George Soros earlier this week\nAnd we could draw a few conclusions from that one is that a single person could be responsible for those and potentially some of the other suspicious packages that have been intercepted are uncovered on Wednesday but it's very early days as I said and beyond that we don't have very much more to go on where they're bombs in these packages\nWill

still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump's favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African

within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now or a Republican Senate refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissent has said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American he was also coming to

with Ron descent as you said he was just do it for the president you made no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is without acts of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\n... times polling numbers they bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nI'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I

this day\nUnfortunately for most of the center this is not Russia or we don't bow down to the president we work with\nA check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement tried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to since lord a to point eight billion dollars\nI'm going to take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on

can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of photos capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of

necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda we recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise and so we got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases\nPoint where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time well\nListen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely after top of our

closer to you I'm In your state [laughter]\nAnd we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin from ... well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been sending off these charges that he took tickets uh Hamilton I mean handled and makes it into this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke a story the text\nIn which a Gillum friend a lobbyist told him about this Hamilton ticket or that the developer had for them Gillum responds awesome\nBut he is insisting it even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket is is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent isn't some polling\nRight yeah I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with ah Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on what it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight and the gubernatorial debate or that or it's going to come down to how Andrew\nTo remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on what it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida or that or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe disadvantages camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president and keep people in the administration Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation our water resources which been a big problem here\nAnd we need to work constructively what the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on him teaching Donald Trump I don't know what for 'em but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive ally with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nIn mind so how is President Trump laying out and say well I mean I think\nYou need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary\nUm to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's and ah\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and bang bang Santas was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results the Republican primary\nTrump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying or\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and being being the St Louis was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided well before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWell and make it as if they don't let me bring you in here because of passing it also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of ah some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way through Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are doing something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that boarded kill December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack\nOn the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the Caribbean and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nIt puts that the the issue of immigration front and center which you already was to be honest in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention describe and has had in the last couple of days and that he will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nUh we'll see that on a ... or ... depending on the turnout both parties I think it really is a a turnout election well let's be clear this\nAlong with health care and and the economy um um I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the coverage and all the attention describing how fat in the last couple of days and that he will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nOr will see that on a ... depending on the turnout both parties I think I read is is a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cat and that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was of the size\nOf a group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last ... than that made you got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people\nOr were accepted into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nOr you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point and Florida it's a great example Robin you see the Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr Trump won the state in two thousand sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans to many of them who are already in Florida before money about all the security Maria over the weekends I have seen ... are coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in to resolve\nA for for the governor's race in ... in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not among a lift ticket\nWho are already in Florida before Monday about all the security Maria over the weekends I have seems a coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor's race in in in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic communism different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling uh shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson Andrew Gillum\nWill kill the economy there like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent thinner and also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out or so after telling a lie because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh and daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee I always colorful but who said the edge here and ... especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the edge here yeah I I mean are\nYou know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday had Nelson's lead a at about seven points I mean a hurricane recovery obviously inherently\nI every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof

better for\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a former selling himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally returning home and try to rebuild my life partner that wanting to be a part of the community couldn't happening now so I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for non violent felons to gain their rights back\nHis administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott as approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past that will be conviction Eddie Kane is one of

his rights back but the process is intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we live alone so other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but I also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons a and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against them and for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but getting what he calls blanket clemency what a constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided\nOn an individual case by case basis with due consideration for the seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important but\nSome law enforcement officials say the current system is making Florida less safe Leon county sheriff Walton McNeil agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like ah you know the sex\nThe seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making Florida less safe Leon county sheriff wall to make Neal agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like a you know a sexual batters who are as keeping them away from kids the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to take but just the a fundamental right to vote there is no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nThe tourists them from any other crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole commission that showed ... who's right to vote was automatically restored under governor crashed were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to give up and turned to a life of crime or 'cause there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I wanted in office to her next certain things but I never got involved because I said what I Can't make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen account and made me feel like well if I'm not a citizen waggling\nSawyer recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIt's kinda like a victory for me and it's kind of like a a book of this\nSo really it made me feel lifted a citizen it kinda made me feel like well over ... ...\n... recently got his rights restored him while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me it was kind of like a book of this part of a book lists I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level do an adjustment for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold that would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in a case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip the Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends\nBut the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future course a hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland\nLet me tell you in person um explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of tightening the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get to hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms\nAt our highland even person I'm explain this decision will you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the ... the consideration that did go into this\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course one to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis\nPicky queens um all part of a you could say a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for three decisions is the fourth record how important is this\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point the point of contention between Republican leaders\nAnd this particular Supreme Court so\nLegislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders\nAnd this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in the past\nWell this is also become a big part of your gubernatorial race here we've been talking about it today Ron sent is a spokesperson warned and he's a Republican or that or the Democrat Andrew Gillum would bow to pressure by out of state radical groups to pick 'em up these activists judges that you just referred to houses that factoring into that campaign\nWe've got all the day's business news coming up on our evening business walk tonight here on key genes easy it starts at six with marketplace\nAt its followed at six thirty by the world this this report from the BBC\nWe've got all the day's business news coming up on her evening business block tonight ... starts at six with marketplace and it's followed at six thirty by the world business report from the BBC [noise]\n\nCame Jane Leavy is supported by a man Kermit cancer specialist worked together to provide personalize care right here in metro Phoenix more at Mayo Clinic dot org slash Arizona\nClear skies this evening in the valley alone you're sixty five degrees sunny tomorrow night eighty six\nEighty eight on friday a few clouds right now with rice fierce guys we have eighty one degrees in Phoenix at twelve forty\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

incoming president we started with Doug so when it comes to work is just give me the ... of the problem that you're seeing and getting workers here\nIn two thousand seven recession we lost fifty percent of our industry and they have not return when founder the work so as things if the backup we're still working with half our workforce\nA lot of people left the industry and then I'm Mark you're left with people who might have aged out of the industry retired\nAbsolutely as a matter of fact our average age framing contractor is fifty seven years old\nSo can you give me the kinds of jobs you are missing right now\nEvery trade is who are missing from drywall are still plumbers to office staff in the construction industry if you talk to any company they are looking for help and they can't find it ended up what's\nWhat some of the side effects what happened as a result of not having enough workers\nFor my general contractors prospect of their homes that used to take us three to four months to build now they're taking six to eight months and I'm sure that your bits have to be higher than they do they have to we have to recover that calls but you still you don't cover the full cost materials have gone up the last three years probably thirty percent\nAre you worried about materials clean up even more up with a tear tariffs and hurricanes\nLeno send us email ... several times a day I was looking from Mary in at a pin\nNow they're taking six to eight months\nAnd I'm sure that you have to be higher than\nThey do have to recover that calls but she's still you don't cover the full cost materials have gone up the last three years probably thirty percent\nAre you worried about materials clean up even more up with a tear tariffs and hurricanes\nAbsolutely lentils send us emails several times a day of those looking from Mary in Panama City to all these places needing their homes to be rebuilt or repaired and I'm thinking to myself we we struggled day to day to keep up with what we have had prior to the storm\nWe I mean physically community housing new has just struggling with balancing act balancing it how do you possibly take not enough workers and take on more\nSo than I Want to bring you into the conversation what are you hearing from people who've been hurt by Michael the lack of finding anyone to help them the lack of a equipment a lack of roofers and a lot of unlicensed activity\nWhat else uh do workers that there are I'm sure you have to really compete to keep them maybe raise salaries mark maybe increased benefits\nIf there's not enough farmers in town or not enough electricians in town to do the amount of work them when they do jobs they raise their prices because they know there's no one else to come in to take the work\nOr if mark has his paint are coming and I know he's coming to Mars job and I look at him and I said listen here you know how about a few extra hundred bucks to come by assuming the first\nYou Patti mark in the back as you're saying that [laughter]\nDo as a small community there is some of that trading that does go around\nThat's ... trading one thing but you're talking about stealing you convening though we ought to be\nYou talked about what happened because of the recession a huge blow but then you have this you know slow steady blow that has to do with immigration I mean we're reading that some of the cuts in both legal and illegal immigration are you're not\nTell us the small community there is some of that trading that does go around\nThat's neat and training for one thing that you're talking about stealing you can think we ought to be\nYou talked about what happened because of the session a huge blow but then you have this you know slow steady blow that has to do with immigration I mean we're reading that some of the cuts in both legal and illegal immigration are you're nodding markers are impacting the building and see\nThey are if you look at a lot of the trades they are immigrants I Believe the hurricane Michael the damage done over there if we did not have workers from other countries that were just would not get done so where do you do\nWhat we're doing through education and bringing our younger kids and introducing them in the construction for decades we taught them it's gotta be college just got to be college got to be college\nAnd you know there's a vast majority of aid don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them and we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract isn't the way over here\nAnd and these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner\nAnd that's climbing so at some point there's going to be hired to me\nYou're right we I mean we push college and for many on people the colleges in the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through a future bill does America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school\nAnd they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine\nThey can go through a future billed as America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school and they can be an apprentice and worked their way through location on a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field of making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys out so it it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but but not to lead immigration just yet\nIf you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and it's you're telling me it's necessary for your industry so what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard workers often times the immigrants are the on the job before anybody else they're working hard they're staying till sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need\nMarked I hear you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's\nA lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and one thing I notice in common of all of them is it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because\nI've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's\nA lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and\nOne thing I notice in common of all of them is it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because their homes or go on their place of business might be gone the shop that he had he was gone it's going to take a lot of builders from a large\nPart of the country that's just the way it is what\nElse would change this place\nWe see a movie recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools we spent many years not exposing\nYoung people to that type work and telling him what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college the guys right here standing there doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nSo Doug should there be some sort of government involvement of kind of making it more enticing what how else to get their revert\nBack to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisory Rosen your you know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners and companies\nDoubled tripled that one more thing I think the stigma that's what the big talk was the last Thirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big hardly you got to get over you\nWorry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming fees and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will not have a building boom\nActual you know getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big hardly you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming fees and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will not have the legal\nNo I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe other states should follow our suit and build strong homes in
