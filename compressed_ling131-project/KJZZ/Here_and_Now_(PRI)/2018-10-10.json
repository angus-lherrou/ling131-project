they have at least twenty victims of the shooter in an area that that was\nDecember second twenty Fifteen the terror attack would claim fourteen lives and injured twenty two including Julie pious who was shot twice after her co worker opened fire during an office Christmas Party\nSix months later we met pious at our home where she showed us some of the Mentos she received during her recovery including a star of hope from one of her nurses\n[noise] the the things that get into the nice people so he runs marathons and Everytime he runs marathons and he said to them for people's comes across

recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona just start over Julie pie as joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed a fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I\nEach hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression is they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were staying on the county\nUm even for that second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing ...\n[noise] now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy so we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um\nNot be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and uh spending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police and he got a hold of me\nAnd we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states and so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to the law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually hurt me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch group\nAnd what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from\nKnow what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he\nGives his perspective from a supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nAs what they experienced and what was running through their mind and how law enforcement and really how they can improve their responses\nFor the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assume they were bad\nI recently met a I'm a teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during the shooting and after I found that out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Detroit thank him do I say a great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through what are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice I think they expect to see someone\nWell meet you and find out what you've been through what are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured\nThat they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations that I've done that actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story it's become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke of us have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\nI I it's so frustrating to me and\nIt just always seems that at the ease of obtaining weapons here but especially the the weapons like the air are Fifteen sons and these\nWeapons that are made to hunt human beings really that's what they're made for they're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting Easter made for hunting humans\nBut especially the the weapons like the air

D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility the richest and the poorest state we\nGovernor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom a Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls is Cox have a chance well\nIt's tough the math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide it's new\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent and the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will it be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and using indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California to coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut\nAnd those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown using has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nWas as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump or the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump's slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nI think the government's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know\nThey have property in California will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great properties of what is the taxes are way way out of whack and [noise] it was such a move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meaning if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are boring grew in California\nI think the government is doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know I have property in California I Will\nSay I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property in California the taxes are way way out of whack and such a move pretty soon and if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs if Lori Drew in California than doing\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters are prepared to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater or last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates are in persuading them to vote for us for the Republican and these congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nI Ford ability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races and you know there are just issues and affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference and others and\nPeople can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races\nAnd you know there are just issues of affordability that I think a lot of these a new party preference voters at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat\nBecause in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh hearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some that said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ...\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary\nUh you know I think Kevin do we don't just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media are paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nOr and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure is going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part-time controller dot com\nEra's gonna help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly a it's a it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know I haven't seen\nBroadwell but one thing one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old\nHe's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California and to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is for some especially for younger voters here in California I'm daily and arguments are certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we find a rewind back to twenty sixteen\nBernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California many of them are young people

American population in the nation\nMary and food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the

diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim his principal and CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Honda former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican and my second generation friends are more on the Democratic side why is that maybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion\nA butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans of Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why the Republicans\nBecause they see the the corruption the government the distrust of government and why the second generation going more democratic I think because of the American values the\nLot of these Korean Americans that grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the process in urban areas into focus more progressive thinking than more of the conservative suburban ideals\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nIn the thought of eliminating that because a lot of my relatives came here through chain migration so and the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from that chain migration system so it seems like Korean Americans the first thing\nAn Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nAnd the thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so\nAnd the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration\nSystem so it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally of a majority of them and they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country\nWill definitely be the my friends are being more democratic or liberal Republicans are progressive Republicans I myself have have definitely some qualms about the key issue\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like Tam and sunny new when we met them at a cafe sunny owns it an Orange County neighborhood called little Saigon sunny told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I I think you know you look at generation one which is our parents um and and I mean we're all one point fight and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences in stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a country where you can't really trust the government\nUnderstand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to vote sites and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it's a stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from us so we came over here you see a lot of all this is a family\nCash only pay you know what you don't want to say what we have our own strategies and we don't want to\nShare a best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why first generations they're known\n'em to be very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate but we grew up in\nAmerica and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually through and\nYou know and being an American\nOr you know and having inclusive easy I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown that because we do collaborate and we're showing\n'em or Christian parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing of best practices we actually sharing best practices entrepreneur and they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big difference from generation one and two\nOutside the cafe in

quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican than helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this\nConnection this this uh ethnic connection and having not a single Korean American interest right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat Republican I Would like to see a Korean American other to represent me up there\nWe heard something similar from Vietnamese American Tam knew when\nYou don't see myself especially as a business owner the community as a Vietnamese American first before\nBeing part of the party as a Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment says very and food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the
