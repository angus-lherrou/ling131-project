Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region and surely Iran has been

Saudi Arabia's in Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old\nCrown prince a has a some some growing up

endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez and it does is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this races reporter WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nA German so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in a mist trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign event he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and you can has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with imminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nGoing over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want to change their embarrassed by this guy\nIt's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting\nWith the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez has lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that the his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so what about you and says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob he's he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about judge\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting for you\n... you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not twice with three times for drugs that those cancer patients critically need\nHe has blamed insurance companies for some of the cost of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting [noise]\n... you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not twice with three times for drugs that those cancer patients critically need\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the cost of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients a vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up cell gene has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he went to the the Republican convention so\nYou know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about him it keeps coming up in my conversations with people but so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know you get tied to Trump and Menendez tied to ...\nThat but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with ... ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election [noise]\nYeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty pretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often does elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank will be on does retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising\nThis race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got it\nWell known now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of

Tom water two cases emerged of men who continued raping women as their DNA sat and the testing cue\nThat's increased the urgency to fix this problem we're looking at how other labs like in Ohio had been able to process than more quickly this year Ohio was able to nearly eliminate its backlog around fourteen thousand rape kit [noise]\nYou know I bought zero really means that my odds of winning
