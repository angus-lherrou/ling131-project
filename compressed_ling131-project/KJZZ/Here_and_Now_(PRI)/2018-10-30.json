through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing which remember short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note until you're thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with them about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian ... ridge I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to a structure of the company for example the so called rust belt who's populated largely by industries which are very old\nSilicon Valley for example is a classic case of who've already knew there are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation threw out the country and it depends obviously whether they were ... were were sort of being processed\nPopulated largely by industries which are very old\nSilicon Valley for example is a classic case of a very new there are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether Iran you Gregory in areas where it was sort of being prices mean something mhm or whether you're on the west coast\nOr the issue of high tech stock prices a little everyone talks about so one thing about this country it's very diverse at at the ... where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge add to this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of the new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity\nFlying uh well basically because fear you know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify\nBudget can you can look at the consequences of it and the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks\nIn the book instantly I might add discussing whether the lowest the long term outlook is all about\nWell we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data unequivocal\nTo take risks in the book and suddenly I might add discussing whether the law the long term outlook is all about\nOh we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data under critically show\nIs that in title ... which are mandated by law a gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar and so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nBut what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging right now the official actuaries of the Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance\nThey'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent indefinitely into the future to do you think they should do that\n[laughter] first of all the drugs that gets going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it they're going to cause the debt overall total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation ... it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact\nSo long as you don't do it they're going to cause the debt overall total government that low over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation ... it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nBut that's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about uh for example interest rates since fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we should have rates low as ... on employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace and the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nRate kept falling oh well below a brief usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept fooling below four percent with no impact on information\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand is there a two conditions as hard for a crisis\nOne is a toxic assets like a secure does two mortgages\nBut the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and when they are financed by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell I don't want to be a general you know that that was a very extraordinary period court narrowed it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve or keep breaks down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWas that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not lower productivity but it's an issue when you get the sort of tight labor market\nWage rates begin to rise of necessity and it's the wage rate rises which affect the cost of production and hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because the costs are going up\nThat's where the problem was that hasn't really been growing up\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talked about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nMore creative destruction is the process by which people do two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing\nOlder equipment but more importantly engenders unemployment and uh\nIt's to process which are unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nServe a condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nHas something to do with Donald Trump's an Australian watches the polarized

Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell then this is really sad day in the neighborhood\nUm I Know that I'm afraid enjoyed the community that diverse than the diversity in the community of squirrel hell and um he loved walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches\nUm that all made him feel at home um the bakeries that delicatessens and he often commented that he could hear yet ... Hebrew and a dozen other languages spoken as he walked down the street of that community\nHe actually learned ... and they pay get yes ah do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on squirrel hill\nI'm\nThere to Mr Roger's neighborhood I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy named it the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think what's reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd ... the ... community where\nAnd I just never heard I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it was a fantasy neighborhood the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think what's reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd ... the ... community where I grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nWhat is that the nation me\n[noise]\nHave you heard that word a lot today in [noise]\nAnd I didn't know what it meant\nWell it means\nSomebody getting killed in a\nSort of surprised way what happened you know men killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about a lot of people are\nSad scared about it you know\nI'd rather talk about some other day and heavy like\nSound courtesy of the Fred Rogers company late ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tiger says he doesn't feel like a picnic\nKnow too many people are talking about a lot of people are sad scared about it you know\nI let it talk about some other day and if you like\nThat sound or courtesy of the Fred Rogers company ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tighter says he doesn't feel like a picnic a she says that's okay\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers talked kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] well I think one of the things that he taught us all lift that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid and there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grim naps were\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with so that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen a lot a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for that\nFor says the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone um have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days look for the helpers\nYes [noise] as\nPart of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence will do some\nI've been terribly concerned about the graphic display of violence which the mass media has been showing recently\nAnd I played for your protection in support of your young children\nThere is just so much that a very young child can say with out of being overwhelming\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of us to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but they don't have to think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers\nI used to be together away from media where we can talk and share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but he also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us\nFred Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time\nCreating a encouragement and spaces where children it and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way\nWere British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nI think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um\nAnd I you know I think that that comforting if neighborhoods um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and\nNeighbor in the greatest sense of the world and everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor\nUm and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds of all faiths of all races\nThe people um and you know I think that that comforting neighbor could um I think he would also said we need to turn to our neighbors and neighbor in the greater sense of the world every one lives on this planet isn't making per\nHum and reach

radio she's in Columbus I Joe\nHello and let's talk about these candidates a Richard Cordray a lot of people know him because he used to run the consumer financial Protection Bureau he is also a five time jeopardy champion and the marshals scholar tell us about him\n[laughter] yeah you know he's kind of nerdy actually and he would say that he's describing himself that way actually but uh\nCovers state politics for high public radio she's in Columbus I Joe hello and let's talk about these candidates or Richard Cordray a lot of people know him because he used to run the consumer financial Protection Bureau he is also a five time jeopardy champion and the marshals scholar tell us about him\n[laughter] yeah you know he's kind of nerdy actually and he will say that he's describing himself that way actually\nBut uh you know the thing with Cordray is he's he's very majored in what he says people here know him he served as a state lawmaker he served as state treasurer he served as a G and then as you said he served in the federal level\nHe's been out of state for a while but now he's back running for governor\nA and he is a coming in saying he wants to uphold the Affordable CARE Act he has a a comprehensive bond package of for road repair and infrastructure improvements so that's that's where he's running right now\nOkay and Mike DeWine is the current ah A. G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMight the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor our former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed against a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying\nHe was a with our governor our former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea of having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAll right let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we are going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let ... it's my turn to an eight out ... and they get out it's my turn on your ...\nOkay here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports said we had the highest increase in ... last year and he stayed in the nation All right so\nWhat we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and ... and it's gotten out of hand\nAnd one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand\nAnd one of the things that we are the issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it with you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but ah you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for\nThem is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or order people what's on their minds\nWhat seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions\nThere trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it what's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind\nBut the most recent polling shows is that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have\nIn this election that can vote\nAnd um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they weren't they\nWant to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you\nWell at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have in this election that can vote\nAnd um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal in Ohio\nAnd that is a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to fly out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good opportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on\nUs joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you representatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing\nTo discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning\nThe plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it

take\nTo crash into the sea early Monday morning the plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us now is ed Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially Going Radical and doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like\nMore than that something perhaps\nTo do with air speed indicators\nAnd a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know if that played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that is happening in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crash of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issue some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly in the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a ... very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening\nActing properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nOr you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so are the very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that health related flight\n... when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new are planted flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max aid is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nOf flying you know for that matter the airlines like American in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border\nAnd and you know of course this is also very rare for something like that so sure at this point you ... you could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened\nAbout the issues and candidates that matter most to you [noise] America on the line\nAnd America on the line is tonight at seven ...
