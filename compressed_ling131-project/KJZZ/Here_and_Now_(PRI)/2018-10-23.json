the races in the mid term elections there's one that doesn't fit the mold a Republican in a very blue state who is way ahead in the polls\nIn fact Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker is the most popular governor in America again a Republican in Massachusetts He's facing Democrat Jay Gonzales and at last check is almost forty points ahead of him in the polls\nAnthony Brooks is senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston he joins us by Anthony hey Jeremy and why is a Republican like they are so popular in Massachusetts well\nWhen it comes down to is that he represents a brand of Republicanism that works really well in Massachusetts is relatively conservative on fiscal issues he doesn't like raising taxes but he's liberal on social issues like abortion rights and marriage equality\nAnd he works well with the state legislature which is dominated by Democrats so in this age of hyper partisanship across the country Baker represents something very different that appeals not only to Republicans in the state but according to our polls to lots of Democrats and independents as well\nYou'd probably call him a Democrat if you were in any other state here he is in a recent debate with Jay Gonzales talking about issues that matter to him or where he has to go against the president\nAlways been quite clear about where I stand on a whole series of things with respect to the president and managed to work pretty hard over the course of the past four years to stop some of the things that the Congress and the president was proposing that would have been particularly damaging the Massachusetts Affordable Care act cuts the cuts in the end I H\nM and cancer and other forms of research and a lot of the work we did associated with a travel ban\nPresident I've always been quite clear about where I stand on a whole series of things with respect to the president and managed to work pretty hard over the course of the past four years to stop some of the things that the Congress and the president was proposing that would have been particularly damaging the Massachusetts Affordable Care act cuts the cuts in the end I H\nM and cancer and other forms of research and a lot of the work we did associated with a travel ban immigration\nWhat more do we know about his politics well we mentioned he's moderate a fiscally cautious socially liberal by contrast his Democratic opponent Jay Gonzales wants to talk about big democratic programs raise taxes on the rich and that's billions and transportation education\nProvide tuition free college and move toward single payer health care system\nBaker is much more cautious I kind of cautious fiscal manager\nPresents himself as a responsible custodian of government a government\nFor example he's made modest investments in early childhood education an effort to fix the T the state's public transportation system but he opposes the kind of big tax hikes and big programs that comes out\nAnd gets ... is trying to remind people that Baker is in fact Republican listen to this moment from that same debate with Baker refused to say whether he would vote in the election for Republican jak deal who is challenging democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren next month you're going to vote for Jeff deal\nGovernor I'm going to vote for me I'm going to vote for Karen polio and I'm going to vote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do you expect to that one you don't know if you're gonna vote for the ... decision\nIt carefully to find out if that's his lieutenant governor ... this is a tough issue for\nReally that was an awkward moment for Baker and it became even more so after the debate when he said that he misspoke and would vote for the Republican ticket which would include a deal now Gonzales is trying to link Baker to deal and by extension to Trump and and this does put\nI'm going to do you suspect of that one you don't know if you're gonna vote for the guardian ... decision\nIt carefully to find out if that's his lieutenant governor ... this is a tough issue for ... really that was an awkward moment for Baker and it became even more so after the debate when he said that he misspoke and would vote for the Republican ticket which would include a deal\nNow Gonzales is trying to link Baker to deal and by extension to Trump and and this does put her in a kind of awkward position this socially liberal anti Trump Republican who says he'll vote for Jeff deal the state's number one Trump supporter of the guy who co chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts does Baker have a relationship with President Trump no\nThey're not close a Baker didn't vote for Trump as we mentioned he's opposed several of his policies but he argues that when he can work with the Trump Administration when it helps Massachusetts he will\nBut this is a state that voted two to one against Trump um so uh you know Baker has to do a bit of a balancing act year when it comes to the president now Massachusetts has a history of modern Republican governors William Weld pulse solution even Mitt Romney who was governor in past\nRomneycare which was the model for Obamacare that's right and Baker is part of that tradition of moderate Republicans that have had success in Massachusetts and across New England for that matter\nThey included people like late Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Olympia Snowe of Maine they were known as you know Rockefeller Republicans fiscally conservative more socially moderate even liberal Baker is part of that tradition if\nBaker does when what is the lesson or is there one for Republicans in other states you know the lesson is that Republicans and Democrats can overcome this hyper partisanship and work together and get things done I think that's one lesson that said bakers brand of moderate Republicanism is increasing increasingly rare\nOnce upon a time it represented a viable wing of the Republican Party that existed across the country but now that wing is on the verge of extinction\nWhat is the lesson or is there one for Republicans in other states\nYou know the lesson is that

lesson is Republican moderates like Charlie Baker increasingly rare\nThat that he Brookes senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston has to be thank you my pleasure well a more traditional Republican is gaining ground on his Democratic opponent in the north Dakota Senate race Kevin Cramer is ahead of senator Heidi Heitkamp in the polls\nI kept one her seat in twenty twelve by fewer than

Guatemala and El Salvador and after those countries failed to stop the migrants from leaving\nHome ... Honduras El Salvador\nYou're in now from NPR and WB you are I'm Peter O'Dowd\nA group of Central American migrants is still moving north today through Mexico toward the U.S border the images have captured the attention of President Trump who said yesterday that he'd cut aid to Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and after those countries failed to stop the migrants from leaving home\n... Honduras El Salvador that made a lot of money every year we give a bar they and they did nothing for us nothing the\nUS will send one hundred and eighty million dollars to those three countries combined\nIn twenty Nineteen alley bill she is MSNBC anchor and economics correspondent he's also the co host of ... in rural alley always good to have you made her so first let's be clear any significant change to that hundred and eighty million dollar funding stream is not just up to the president he'd he'd have to go to Congress and get them involved to\n... to go to Congress for half of it because Congress passed legislation last year that allows up to twenty five percent of the aid that goes to those countries to be withheld\nIf the secretary of state doesn't certified to Congress that they're making progress reducing illegal immigration so half a twenty five percent can be held that way but up to fifty percent of it can be withheld if the administration determined that the countries\nHave run afoul of anti corruption provisions so there are a couple of technicalities but they can actually the administration can withhold up to fifty percent of the aid that goes to these countries without Congress\nOkay and by the way that one hundred and eighty million dollars is already less than what the US ... past years\nRight ah in fact foreign aid for the three countries the president's talking about his forty percent less than what was allocated in two thousand sixteen so they're already getting a lot less funding from the U.S than they did a also you know the president's trying to push each of these three countries to enact reforms to\nIncrease private investment so they're not as dependent on government money and stem the flow of immigrants and he's\nLess than what the US ... past years that's right ah in fact foreign aid for the three countries the president's talking about his forty percent less than what was allocated in two thousand sixteen so they're already getting a lot less funding from the U.S than they did a ... also you know the president's trying to push each of these three countries to enact reforms to\nIncrease private investment so they're not as dependent on government money and stem the flow of immigrants and he's also a made a decision to cancel temporary work permits and legal status for about two hundred and fifty thousand Salvadorans Hondurans who are already in the United states this hurts those countries because\nThey depend so heavily unwritten Minton says from people who work overseas who then send money home\nAnd I'm taking a look at where the foreign aid goes goes to programs that help reduce poverty in the country's help reduce violence help reduce food insecurity those are the very problems that force people to migrate north in the first place could the president be making the problem worse for himself\nYeah absolutely or he could be that the the new one sophisticated view of this is that there are problems in particularly Nicaragua which is about to collapse and further south in Venezuela so there's a there's a bit of a refugee asylum\nEconomic problem all through south and Central America right now and you know the same way the Syrians in Iraq is go to European countries\nThat kind of a problem we've got here we sort of need to try and figure out what this problem looks like in the host countries and with Mexico who maybe in exchange for certain incentives might be able to settle more of these people but yeah doing it this way cutting this funding or it will only exacerbate the problem\nBut could the threat and be a big enough stick for those countries who don't want to see that money not show up in their coffers do to get them to do something more to to keep those migrants at home\nThat's definitely the approach Donald Trump is taking with kind of every issue that he's dealing with the you know more\nIncentives might be able to settle more of these people but yeah doing it this way cutting this funding or it will only exacerbate the problem but could the threat be a big enough stick for those countries who don't want to see that money\nNot show up in their coffers do to get them to do something more to to keep those migrants at home that's definitely the approach Donald Trump is taken with kind of every issue that he's dealing with the you know more more sticks than carrots we haven't heard from anything from these three countries that we don't know whether they're considering policy changes\nThere is a technical problem because by treaty citizens of Honduras El Salvador Guatemala can move freely within each country without a passport so you can't prevent them from leaving the country very few countries actually prevent people from leaving\nUs so we don't know yet what they're going to do and MSNBC's alley bill she thank you my pleasure this you know\n... supported by Mayo Clinic where cancer specialist worked together to

hailing company lift is bringing electric scooters to Washington DC it's the first east coast city to get scooters from lift but scooters are already widespread in the nation's capital with companies like bird lime and skip already offering rent a boat dock all is electric scooters for short trips around the city\nJeff ... is the director of the Washington DC department of transportation he joined us there Hi Jeff Hi Jeremy so how many scooters are there in DC right now approximately\nWell we currently have upwards of two thousand doc was vehicles both a bike and scooters combined and how long have they been around\nWe launched a pilot program about a year ago or two\nCity Jeff Rudy and ... is the director of the Washington DC department of transportation he joins us now Jeff Hi Jeremy so how many scooters are there in DC right now approximately well we currently have upwards of two thousand doc was vehicles both a bike and scooters combined and how long have they been around\n[noise] we launched a pilot program about a year ago or to allow these companies to demonstrate to technology here in Washington DC about a year ago and have people been happy with them so far are what are they saying\nWell we've gotten a lot of feedback about their use and certainly there are several people who have a really be be on to use these as a part of their daily commuting experience and others who are using them for a periodic trips to go a long distance or how how far are they going to commute with a scooter\nWhat we've seen a different types of trips in some cases they are short distances in some cases they are a longer connection a distance is getting to and from metro stations for example so there are number of use cases that we have observed or over the past year and\nOne of the things that a lot of cities have said about these scooters one of the problems that they've seen is that people just leave them on the sidewalks and the clog up the sidewalks and then if you're disabled and you're trying to use your wheelchair and get down the sidewalk you could get stuck because there's there are a bunch of scooters in front are you seeing that there\nThis is something that we heard very early on during the demonstration period and it's something that we took very seriously in working with\nThe companies to ensure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use of were reflective of those things and uh that it has become\nSomething that we're we're working very closely to to enforce and and we see the incidents of those things are decreasing and do you have a good relationship with the companies are you in contact with them regularly\nA we have ah been working with them\nEnsure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use a were reflective of those things and that has become something that we're we're working very closely to to enforce and and we see the incidence of those things are decreasing\nAnd do you have a good relationship with the companies are you in contact with them regularly\nA we have ah been working with them to collect data and information and also to report problems that we hear from from members of the public here in Washington DC uh and so we have a opened a line of communication with them to ensure that we're sharing information at and that they're sharing information with us\nAnd they are sharing information with you that is correct\nSo obviously one of the big concerns is safety and I'm just last month there was an SUV that hit and killed a man who was riding a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time that somebody has\nDied in an accident in the U.S on on one of these scooters what are you know about that or what can you tell us about that and and how you're making sure that that doesn't happen again it leads to the extent that you can try to stop it from happening again\nWell D.C is a city that is committed to vision zero which is a a a strategy that under the leadership of our mayor we've put in place\nTo eliminate roadway fatalities in serious injuries\nAnd we're doing everything that we can taking it very seriously to work with uh the technology companies that are here to ensure that that their rules and regulations are are are followed by their users we're also taking a number of steps to ensure that we're building the safest possible infrastructure [noise]\nAh it's worth noting that all forms of transportation come with inherent risks\nAnd so we're working with in this case with these companies specifically a two to ensure that they are promoting the safest possible a use for their users and that we are a informing the public\nWasn't regulations are are are followed by their users we're also taking a number of steps to ensure that we're building the safest possible infrastructure [noise] ah it's worth noting that all forms of transportation come with inherent risks\nAnd so we're working with in this case with these companies specifically a two to ensure that they are promoting the safest possible a use for their users and that we are a informing the public about uh about this new form of technology this new form of mobility that is on the road\nWith one of the things that people upset about the the safety risk of these scooters is that a lot of the people who ride them not just in Washington but all over the country are wearing helmets and that they're they're out on the roads with cars but they're not wearing helmets or do they have to wear helmets in D.C\nCurrently the law and DC are for helmets is is limited to individuals who are sixteen or under or some of the companies as you may know do a giveaway helmets and they strongly incentivize a riders to use helmets and and that's something that that I think companies are are thinking about as a as this technology moves forward\nAnd what about a a government or what about the district of Columbia are are you thinking or are people in D.C thinking about putting in a law that says that people have to wear helmets if they're writing these rented scooters\n[noise] you know I Can't speak to what lawmakers may or may not do with respect to changing the the current helmet law certainly we are uh always encouraging both cyclists and people who are using scooters or to to be as safe as possible and that that includes wearing a helmet\nSo you get to see the data as you said what are you finding about how this is changing transportation in DC is it having a big effect\n[noise] it's it's very early to tell what what the impacts will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling and to to trips taken that's really why we have decided to do this in an incremental approach to allow a cat\nSo you get to see the data as you said what are you finding about how this is changing transportation in DC is it having a big effect [noise] it's it's very\nEarly to tell what what the impacts will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling into to trips taken that's really why we have decided to do this\nIn an incremental approach to allow uh kept a number of these vehicles on the street to observe their use patterns but also to to really a dive deep into the data to to get a better understanding of of how the public is interacting with them\nAnd right now the cap number is what the cat number is four hundred per company okay and so now we're talking about with the addition of lift are currently in a district there there are five companies five companies Jeff you've been in Washington now for a number of years how big is the\nAddition of electric scooters Douglas rent a bull electric scooters compared to any other changes that you've seen and transportation including by the way over and left over the years\nI Am glad that you mentioned uber and Lyft because there was a time when that technology first emerged and came into the market uh that that people were asking a lot of the same types of questions that we are now asking about a duck with bikes and scooters\nAnd Geico
