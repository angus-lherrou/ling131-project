I Would say you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part released in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and it really key document is an internal memo written by coverage secretary Wilbur Ross who as our secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty sexes\nAnd ... he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty census as soon as shortly after he became ... the

the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen and then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey what\nReasons then does the administration gave for why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least once a thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department or which is representing a secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the lawsuits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intent is mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to a better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted\nResponses from a citizenship question to better and for section to

data is not enough ah is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty census\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include\nA communication between a Kris Kobach the currents are Republican gubernatorial candidate as well as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross to add a citizenship question and his concern was that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers juice to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty census is going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what is a massive undertaking\nWell they are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross added will it stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau is facing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play important part for live households and me\nWhat does a massive undertaking well\nThey are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross edible at stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really

particularly well and he passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were ah myself included\nAnd I was struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like ah our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of\nPublic we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case evidence in a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presents his kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan hands into your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan ... kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nWell I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also that the people around\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also that the people around him are killed by the story as well my mom she feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this ... you know best friend of their son who of course isn't I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear haven't mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they can\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter] I'm not [laughter]\nYou have to ... you were able to put those feelings into a song what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nKnow it's true I'm enjoying the we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments in the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nYeah it is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book\nAllows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and uh and same token we also felt like we want to distribute different experience from musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments\nProcess of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as as a novel because the book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and the same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and then also had slightly hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty hair becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before where I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you Erica I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact we all wanted to know more about ...\nSuicide Iraq I'm an engineering be careful not to romanticize that's\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and the and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I say I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's there's a him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all\nYou know I'm darkness they don't want to get anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter do you want to imagine more about Connor and\nI think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does and it was important to us that it not feel mano causal\nI'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does you know\nI think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know using the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times of what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country\nIt's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're you know doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't paw I understand that while you debated what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan and Conor what might happen\nYeah this is just than you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing a novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fans around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listen to the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and\nIf your head or

George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned it to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were ego that people take care of their team take care of themselves recognizing that there's a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay within their areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult to uh in in desperate\nHave you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that we're going back to work with a next month so we're hoping

a pretty ... white community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHave grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah follows me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they married someone from outside Greece needs ... workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants

what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned you're in the states and take it back to the origins of you
