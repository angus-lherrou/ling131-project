nice\nTo talk to you tell me first to focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women\nAre the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nSo um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen\nFor planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handout stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses but before they even carried out there\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... audio service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in nonprofit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part time controller dot com\nHandouts stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses but before they even carried out their plan\nThe police in in all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around ever rats and focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what is the ... well I'm well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because I'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charge them with and and in the end it was something\nAkin to disturbing the social order\nUm but the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film is fine\nUm well I mean among the feminist five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse and their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the mites herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nImpetus for these particular women the film is fine\nUm well I mean among the feminist five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse in their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement\nHas personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back\nOne of the of some of his five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined the only need a bachelor's degree you know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China\nOr equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nWell I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume that double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the con find moments of of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda\nI mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically\nSo the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and ... and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant um they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part\nAs if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um says that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy\nIt's been encouraging are trying to push 'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year\nAnd this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\nIn every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went online and we're sharing their stories but how other areas I work with all the censorship going on in China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship which has become incredibly sophisticated\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went on line and we're sharing their stories but how other areas I work with all the censorship going on

them in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences Sarah Verizon has the child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student beat John have in common\nWe went to similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school as you did I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books\nHave in common we went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school as you did I I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller [laughter] so [laughter] you should um\nGive it up we both love comic books and we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help he is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um Dijon is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues ... right right and heat you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorists holding an AK forty seven was in the ... right right yeah so shocked on yeah and has sent it anonymously to the student body so the schools trying to figure out who has sent to his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him an allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to\nBe a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right [laughter] and people have all sorts\nOf rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and all these kind of ...\nSort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be\nUm the poster boy for international politics right [laughter]\nAnd people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do do you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating\nA Japanese person to a Korean person where it so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of\nIt before you called us polite racism and this is something to be John faces as well\n... what's the difference between polite and impolite where he says I think most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone\nPolite and impolite where he says I think most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone\nSo how does speech on in the book realized that understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of\nIt's in for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part it's pretty cool and calm and collect 'em and stands up for other people in his ear and himself but there are other times when his internal\nMonologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know stop or yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to\nTo have him have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean wouldn't have what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because they do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia I like the character to just have an adventure or you know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do twenty so just like you\nYou know what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because they do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia I'd like the character to just have an adventure or you know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get\nTo do twenty so just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't white lady chose your person you don't want to be the vote no well no but\nFor all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved but I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time [noise]\nWhat do you what's the pay for you it was just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but I it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people less\nIf you were you know I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and do you want to the conversation to be started among students would be the theme of that conversation huh I Would\nReally even though he's fictional and very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people last\nIf you were in I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and the one of the conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice and prejudice times and\nHow can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ... thank you thank you so much appreciate it Sarah

three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not saying natural catastrophe it's a man made a trauma that is the result of a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years I wouldn't either side winning\nAnd I want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a

when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so we ... them into the

he still rather we not use his full name his first name now is Randy\nIn Nineteen Ninety Randy had a passion for symphonic music the moody blues and the trombone he's still place makes a living at it mostly in house bans on cruise ships but back then Randy had recently earned a masters in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing to supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nYou know at nighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read I could bring my horn and practice I was always happy to say yes to filling I'm\nDoesn't recall any special training are specific instructions for the night shift beyond the requirement to register his presence in each of the galleries\nOr versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nYou know at night time when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read I could bring my practice I was always happy to say yes to filling in\nRandy doesn't recall any special training or specific instructions for the night shift beyond the requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries\nOn all the floor during his round he did that by swiping magnetic strapped he wasn't originally on the schedule to work the night after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reported they called in sick\nEdited told him about the carriage has to learn but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to us at the watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police I immediately made that connection oh this might have something to do with the alarm that went off\nOne of the uniformed man said he recognized Abbott and asked to see his id\nHe said yeah I Do know you there's a warrant out for your wrist and he told ... to stand against the wall and put his arms up he does the pat down he puts the cops on\nAnd on just standing there with my job open going wow you know what what's going on what to do this he really in some kind of trouble and it's still never occurred to me that they were anything but policemen\nBy stepping out and away from the desk Rick Abbott's also stepped away from the still means a signaling traveled to the outside world to museums panic button no sooner with Abbott against the wall and

eyes so about the time that he begins putting the duct tape and he says this is a robbery and so then everything was finally crystal clear what was going on you know that it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and then suddenly and made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why the war was going to your mind when suddenly duct tape is going around your head\nIt's very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise] um but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them saying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some relief\nAnd I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid go along with whatever they\nThere's nothing here in this museum that is worth my
