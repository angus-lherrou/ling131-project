Know the efforts have been made to try to convince the Taliban not to not to damage at this crucial protests but of course no matter what the what the Taliban do or don't do there's still the forces

Seventeen years now since the U.S led war in Afghanistan the toppled the Taliban it doesn't sound like they are are giving up anytime soon that they still would like to retake control of the country well\nThat's a big question I think there hadn't been studies which show that the Taliban\nOur eyes are controlling or have an influence in a very large number of Afghan districts the estimates go anywhere from fifty to Seventy percent of of the districts\nBut it has always been said that they cannot take the capital Kabul which would be the most heavily secured a part of of Afghanistan and of

B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ... and we learned today that China's economic growth is at its lowest level since the global financial crisis\nThe economy there grew six point five percent in the quarter that ended last month down from six point seven percent a year ago China stock market is down thirty percent since January and the currency the yuan is falling against the dollar the country's finance officials today last day media blitz to try to shore up confidence\nKind of his economic growth is at its lowest level since the global financial crisis the economy there grew six point five percent in the quarter that ended last month down from six point seven percent a year ago China stock market is down thirty percent since January and the currency the yuan is falling against the dollar\nThe country's finance officials today last state media blitz to try to shore up confidence in the economy joining us now is NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz Hi Rob hey Jeremy so six point five percent of we'd love that kind of a growth rate in the United states in China it read news\nIt is bad news yeah six forty five percent we haven't seen that uh since two thousand nine and that was when the global financial crisis hit and had a pretty tremendous impact on China and the jobs in China you know there are many many jobs lost after that and uh\nSo going back to that is not what I think China's regulators and China's bankers and China's economic planners were hoping for\nAnd so what is causing it is it mostly the terrorists from the United states well China's economy has\nBeen begging for the last few years you know the government is dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble in urban China and the biggest pressure on the economy comes from this historic transition that China is making to shift\nThe way that its economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and when you're the second largest economy in the world and you're managing one point four billion people that type of economic transition is pretty painful in pretty complicated and that's part of what we're seeing here\nAnd are they expecting that it's going to last for a long time this downturn or or that they'll be able to work their way out of it somehow\nWell I think that's where the terrorists come into play because we've got in the midst of a downturn we've got these tariffs from the United states and that is happening at a pretty vulnerable time\nOr a billion people that type of economic transition is pretty painful and pretty complicated and that's part of what we're seeing here\nAnd are they expecting that it's going to last for a long time this downturn or or that there'll be able to work their way out of it somehow\nWell I think that's where the terrorists come into play because we've got in the midst of a downturn we've got these tariffs from the United states and that is happening at a pretty vulnerable time for China so\nAh when you look at both the fact that China's economy is already lagging it's ... you know markets are tumbling and its its its currency is also starting to decline pretty quickly here\nAh and then you've got these new tariffs coming for us I think that's creating a lot of psychological bears for the Chinese and it's a it's basically making people or try to make sure up what they've got and I think the entire system is preparing for a big shock right now\nWell you mentioned the currency or it hit a two year low against the dollar or this week and President Trump has been accusing China of keeping the currency artificially low so when uh the currency hits a two year low is that by design or is that by accident\nThat's an interesting question you know the economists I talked to are dismissing this idea that China's purposely weakening its currency to make its exports cheaper China used to do that but that's not really what's happening now what's happening is that the u._s. dollar is stronger than ever thanks to President Trump's tax cuts and the feds raised interest rates\nIn fact it's fair to say here that China doesn't want its currency to beat appreciating this fast because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nAnd what's interesting also is that China is manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what Trump is accused China of doing a sense of summer China's been trying to strengthen its currency so that it wouldn't weaken so fast so\nIt's in fact it's fair to say here that China doesn't want its currency to beat appreciating this fast because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nAnd what's interesting also is that China is manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what Trump is accused of doing a sense of summer China's been trying to strengthen its currency so that it wouldn't weakens so fast so if China should stop manipulating its currency the\nUN would weaken much faster which is what Trump does not one because that could lead
