I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to you and ... that's a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for some people or if not with the audience fought people from the fifth each\nSo would you use many different techniques like links to his identification whereby ... gone for the footage until we notice and normally scientists and appearing mostly because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that we've got some memory and then if we see that person to get enough of it if it were stopped building to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person we're looking full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there is some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of that evidence for you as a detective in it in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant it's estimated about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because being on that said ... which I was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps are pictures of suspects the oath I Would not always look into the suspects sometimes ... victims were looking for missing\nHow important is that trove of evidence for you as a detective in it in that unit\nI think is actually pretty in his estimate about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nThey know that said recognize unit which was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wants\nA pictures of suspects the oath I Would not always look into the suspects ... victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help self ... people well what kind of cases did you crack a really good one was there was a mouse who has a one of ... most wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out of the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... just to suspect I've never met them before about seeing a picture of them full\nSolve going around in the police ... he's giving me folks details destroy swab or lost at the same and they'd been stopped several times on the police officers who had recognized him being on London's most wanted but luckily ... I'm In ... when we took him back to fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell us how you found them\nWe did get quite often we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe you me for that one sided I ah like did appreciate is a very unique skill\nWow Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think that she's sort of been that we think that super recognizes a less than one percent to population very very few people have this ability\nWe found some very small differences in the way that they have brains function and I think that's the sort of direction that the research may be going in future\nIs it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nThink it's a different function is is quite an interesting question that because\nVery few people have this ability we found some very small differences in the way the brain function and I think that's the sort of direction that the research may be going in future\nIs it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think is a different function is is quite an interesting question that because\nPeople have done research on a world champion soup and memorize is who ... hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested that face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing so to streams and numbers in words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that these specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact almost the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities\nNeeding to know a large number of faces wouldn't being very necessary so so that sort of strange situation as far as the sun is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associates it with\nOther aspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly too in the super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis ... the sun's definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces is well how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I say we're very very good high quality images computers\nSomehow change slightly to in these super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis and that's not the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces is well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I say we're very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut with low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human beings still beat computers\nI think in the future well what the situation is going to be it's the best algorithms working with the best humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions\nWhat are the limitations that people like Kenny have\nAs a human being needs to sleep unlike a computer or we get tied fatigue there isn't that must be a limit to how many images and how many people can he can say I'm big before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\nWell is really I think ... impressive about Kenny scale is he's ability to rule out\nWe have a

most importantly for cancer patients around the world will tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works\nOr in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and his main insight was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably at Dr level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure\nThat acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that

ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood\nThe underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer and so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call them you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation\nAnd creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments are sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nI I Do believe that this will lead to insights\nAnd two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new

more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at ... or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nThe Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his

I spoke to lots of people while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticize that even though you know this is a part of Spain where\nIt tends to bring quite a lot and it's on the Atlantic side of Spain um people tend to get into their cause whenever it's raining\nAnd also people said to me that just change their habits are they\nWhat about emergency vehicles police fire ambulances

what did he say about why he wanted to do this\nWell he you know he basically said that the old city was effectively a dumb but it was a that people didn't like going there that it was full of

this up could underscore that by tomorrow but they can't be viewed as rushing this remember the terms of the agreement laid out by Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona on friday was that this was supposed to take a week\nNow let me get a little bit into the weeds here and this is very important and there's a procedure\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader has a right to file what's called cloture that's an effort to end debate and whenever he does that consider that to be day one a confirmation vote after you run through all the Senate traps would be on about day for maybe day five\nMitch McConnell really can't do that until Wednesday at the earliest the question is if he goes ahead before the FBI investigation is complete\nIs he interrupting disagreement with Jeff like Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOr if they they are OK with that and they're like yes okay this is satisfied it hasn't been a week that's fine let's go ahead\nThen everybody a you know is is cool with it that's fine but if if the he's perceived as jumping the gun that's a problem that could be viewed as a violation of the agreement and you know just like got a lot of criticism from some conservatives over the weekend or who you know criticized him for saying that you know he was delaying all this\nThey wouldn't have a chance of getting the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh were it not for Jeff Flake they're basically sitting right now about forty nine years\nAnd with this deal they could potentially get Collins potentially get Murkowski maybe Joe Manchin a

up hundreds of mainly young independence activists who have been sleeping outside the capital and politicians\nSaying that for the next few weeks and months later to try to protect the general states of the government the regional governments until they declare independence so that could be here for some time well let's hear from one of the activists that you spoke with this is a man named Roger Espanol who was shot by police\nIndy I he was actually he was blinded by a rubber bullet last October first and you asked him what has been achieved by the referendum the first step\nWas the first of all the ... and I'm sure we're going to make it yes\nEven if we're going to have the political power in our site\nGabbing to these protestors believe they still have a shot at independence\nSome of them do one of the grassroots group called the CD all through the campaign for Democratic Republic who this morning touch on some of the major no toy routines about selecting a stop to all the traffic they they have managed to break into the train stations to a high speed train running from\nOne of the major cities to fall alone you know their rights even in the new regional presidents and uncle Kim Toyota\nHas said today that base activity is working keep pushing it so I think this will be seen as provoke us have certainly by the main government in Spain you're saying the socialist government and the prime minister ... there is no chance of\nEver a referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy\nAnd last night I put that to the spokesperson for the cattle on separate discussion here\nAnd join the PKK he said to me categorically no and they will\nBe seen as provocative certainly by the main government in Spain and you're saying the socialist government to the prime minister Pedro Sanchez there is no chance of ever a referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy and last night I put that to the spokesperson for the cat on separate his government here\nAnd join Maria ... he said to me categorically no and they will continue he said working on accept disobedience like be illegal referendum if they don't get an independence choice now he said when and how he said not now I'm telling you will do something\nWell you know we should point out that their recent polls that say that people in the region are split on the issues so there are many people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those who\nDo not um how how divided yeah Catalonia\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because you know in the in the year since we had a really pivotal moment the polls haven't changed even divided fifty fifty and I think that the the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts who look at the situation now they believe the\nWrong thing this increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is that you nailed it that divided front gel sense it could very easily spark off again\nOn the streets but the BBC's Gavin speaking with us from the streets of downtown Barcelona Gavin thanks so much for your time we do appreciate it\nKnow [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] Mm [noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather is a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy against is here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make\nMm [noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm us up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to me I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved deep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you start a fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk a walk the ideal shape for holding the oil knows flattering it's got the high sides\nYou want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a it's a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I have my walk I also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nHad about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Chris go you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there\nI can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred and I am always adjusting to tape it around through twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get is three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk that's fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch All right good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into it\nBut he's a Gemini type it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk that's fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch All right good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender I says chicken it at some of that is sick flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another ... okay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the breast pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not an over or under cook it now you got a little bit of money here and some lemon so I didn't do so you would yeah that and I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey\nAdds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken for ... oh yeah and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting out this sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle and a kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did\nFor waffles and chicken for ... oh yeah and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting and Israel aims out this sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle and a kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answered the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end\nAnd was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having\nNot greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go just gone\nAnd soy sauce ginger little ketchup sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important\nThis is double fried food so you fry it you cool it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy knows that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy arenas\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I similar it down again the chili paste the ginger and I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and\nI don't know what do you think it's delicious and and find a way I sent well and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans I've also\nThe marinate I similar it down again the chili paste the ginger and I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and\nI don't know what do you think it's delicious and and find a way I sent well and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at past schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go and how well his fried chicken\nBack in the day so there's a lot of history lots of history and David ... did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode

recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen\nAnd statewide the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years across the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening in a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one\nWhy the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years across the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming\nWell it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington and one of the district trying to figure all this out Carly welcome yeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing their peers county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have the total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you're working minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars\nOr you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and\nReally it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNow you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them\nAnd it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off there are families that aren't even getting identified because they\nUnderneath them and it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nI noticed that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it\nI go out and my community and I do drive ... to go to the address if they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment that they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports\nJust want to ask them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years\nUm there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska this used in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with\nUm just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need so what kind of help or are you getting\nWe um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to\nHave the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive\nWe'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need and we have a food program where we\nI'm funding and donations\nI Believe a vessel we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need some times we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on friday so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and so I guess it's not it's not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team baffle it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you will know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day in your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nOn their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it the bill ... them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be I'll just give you an exam\nWith the class work it's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nUm their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be [noise]\nI'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had\nNo self value could care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHis like I'll probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy so after a couple meetings with him over the next week um I had discovered they loved animals", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)",
