ten years ago Trump denies that but did authorize a payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen\nTrump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment will Stormy Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure\nJoined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about more than the night she says she slept with Trump\nEverybody wanted me to write a tell all and it was like I really don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that at big you know Ninety seconds and ah back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it'd be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that and the interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I Want it to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSo like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said housings transpired and why they happen the way they did and the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control 'em all\nThings that I Want it to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSo like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said housings transpired and why they happen the way they did and the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still sure that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I read\nIt might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you talked about at the beginning you grew up in Baton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food or you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine\nAnd you were called the liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you were able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know\nUm basically what I just said that I don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a a feeling for\nWhere I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there was a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was silent saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than ...\nCompletely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I was and I would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than the hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted it to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy with you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out\nBut then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and I just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell the my side of the stories of people to understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward\nAnd I just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen\nUm I think we're all about to find out on what is the December twelve\nHe was the kind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it\nYou know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled and then he's the one that started happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he had messed up he just continue to do so I think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that [noise]\nKind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it\nYou know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he'd messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that\nI also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean it met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being in the adult entertainment business you know um but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWill you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this nondisclosure now my fear lies mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they're awesome [laughter]\nBut what does that what is that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone I Would you be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted it I've gotten used to it and we've become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and ...\nWhat's your story it was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone how would you be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted I've gotten used to it and we become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they're harbored this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask\nBy over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years\nUm as it shaped the way that you perceived him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much I still stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the adult business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have company is and people and high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow very\nPrivileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and\nStill holds true today how would you describe it today\nI don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hung out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report on the wall Street Journal this week uh that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair with him ... how do you respond\n[noise] I don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hung out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report in the wall Street Journal this week uh that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair within ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nThat actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news that where you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nAh actually the exact opposite [laughter] from around the ... [noise] yeah for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over and over\nDo not following politics closely\nUm things yes but I'm not reading the news and the news stories and specially saying away from anything about me where you're coming out with this book just a month before the midterm elections do you want this to influence the way that people vote\nThat was not my intention at all that was literally how fast can get done how fast and get print that how fast can this happened it was not a strategy at least not on my part maybe the publisher smarter than I thought but I don't think so I don't think it was actually part of a master plan\nWhat do you what happened in the mid term elections or do you do have a view on that\nYou know I Do I think that it's going to be very interesting like I said I've watched everything ... I don't want to jinx anything so I'm just going to wait and see\nMaybe the publisher is smarter than I thought but I don't think so I don't think it was actually part of a master plan\nWhat do you what happened in the mid term elections or do you do have a view on that\nYou know I Do I think that it's going to be very interesting like I said I've watched everything ...

to ... how have you been it's been so long since we've talked to you\nI Know I like ever since the last time we spoke and or at least since the last time I've been to this NPR studio they've completely redone it oh ... okay but the music will still be incredible because it's coming from you this is the first one polo intend to French DJ's this is their song awkward [noise]\nJeeze\nTalk to you I Know I like ever since the last time we've spoken or at least since the last time I've been to this NPR studio they've completely redone it oh wow it's okay but the music will still be incredible because it's coming from you this is the first one polo intend to French DJ and this is their song [noise]\nJeeze [noise]\n\n\n\nSo they're saying they're sweet and why do they see on which is following me under the ocean I can tell us about this one [noise] you know this album ... by polo and pan it came out\nYear but then it got re released this year in the states with five additional tracks and that's when it sort of came on to my radar\nUm it's got a very tropical kind of feel that route the album um and I know we're in the fall now but it's been a while since I spoke to you so just want to catch everybody our I'm classic this this this is the sound of the summer I um it'll you still use it next summer too but\nWhen I'm screening albums to looking for stuff to play on my show if I can find three or four songs on an album I'm really happy and it's a I I consider that to be a good album or just care about album though has Seventeen tracks and I think I've\nPlayed something like fourteen of them on my show already\nSo basically like ...\nDo you still use it next summer too but when I'm screening albums to looking for stuff to play on my show if I can find three or four songs on an album I'm really happy and I I consider that to be\nA good album or just care about album though has Seventeen tracks and I think I've played something like fourteen of them on my show already\nSo basically like every uh every track on this album is great and that is like an unheard ratio for for my show to be into that\nMany of the songs but there's so many different looks I mean they have they have like some songs inspired by Brazilian some butter some daytime disco system club ready house cut some ambient songs that kind of run the whole gamut and what would you say is the ... overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic I mean I Would say this is you know they've definitely got an ear for a pop 'em but it definitely is more electronic driven and or if I were to Johnny comparisons between other bands I Would say it's sort of like disclosure meat school side\nOh I like that that's great we had to a site on the show actually they're great um yeah\nLet's listen to the next one you brought up this is the Swedish group ... boys are this is called sport [noise]\n\n\n\nOkay so tell us what's going on here\nYou know what I Am not completely without going on but I've seen a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people\n\n\n\nOkay so tell us what's going on here\nYou know what I Am not completely without going on but\nI've seen a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people are saying it's a commentary on male hyper masculinity ...\nUm when I first heard it I just thought it was a really goofy fun track 'em and it's one of those songs like it it reminds me when I was a little kid I wasn't allowed to watch Miami Vice before I went to sleep as they would give me a way to fire it up before bed and this song sort of has the same effect on me every time I hear it\nAnd obviously funny would you say it's like a good lesson to do you like\nTo listen to the song is an unbelievably fun lesson yet I mean like ... or after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be you'll be chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and every other time\nAs the sun moves on to become the belief singers bashing Murphy becomes more and more on him just um until the end you basically just a blob puddle I'm poor people can\nPeople can go on our website and listen to the entire thing it here now I Hope that I really hope they do okay or the next one is from Ireland uh this is maverick saber a who just released this new songs drifting here to\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nJust [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI like that why do you ... absolutely I mean it's such an unorthodox delivery to and I think that's the first thing that really caught my attention with this song or the beat is really simple really funky but more than that it's just sort of the way he sounds on it was just kind of\nOther worldly who is maverick saber he's an Irish R. and B. singer I'm I guess he's been releasing record since two thousand eleven I Know a lot of people had been fans with him for a while I just sort of caught on to him with the song drafting\nA but he's also on the label of Georgia Smith who was sort of a an up and coming R. and B. singer from the u._k. and he's appeared on one of the Georgia Smith eat peas the project a Lebanese BP and I think that's where a lot of people may be heard maverick Saper for the first time okay\nAh the next one that you brought us is Wolverine huh this is from Diana Gordon [noise]\n\n\n\nWhich we know about this one Diana Gordon just released\n[noise]\n\nWhat do we know about this one Diana Gordon just released her first ET as a solo artist but she's been around the music industry for a while and she's written for Mary cheap lives and she had three songs on beyond says lemonade album\nIncluding sorry daddy lessons and don't hurt yourself and she had a previous career as an ATM singer under the name winter Gordon but I feel like this is\nThis is Diana Gordon kind of doing her own thing\nSort of sort of a reinvention of Diana Gordon I guess but clearly multi talented person yeah I mean she she definitely knows how to write songs in and she can sing them too I mean sometimes when the singers things you can sort of feel their heart and soul and sweat have experience in their voice and to me this is one of those instances\nUm she just sort of recalling her upbringing and sort of you know it's also very aspirational at the same time\nThe last one that you have brought us is albatross this is from Westerman\nGoods that is the way they found some news [noise] [noise] but uh it's\nDid you really check [noise] [noise]\nWe know about this one so albatross is the first single from west

joins us from ... in San Francisco welcome and congratulations\nThank you it's wonderful to be on the show well how did you\nCome to this story this time in history\nIt'd be a very different different novel I'm a psychiatrist and I was very interested in ... psychiatric history in the Nineteen twenties and was reading about a psychiatrist at that time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors that time and have a back story that involved the first World War\nAnd so I began to read about the medical experience in the first World War and\nAs I was reading that I began to encounter this anecdote of how the ... army was so ill prepared that\nThey began to recruit a medical students sometimes a dentist and unfettered errands to serve very important roles and your hospitals on the front tending to knock the numbers of men\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school and all of a sudden to imagine this colleague across time hundred years ago leaving his medical training and being asked to perform medical responsibilities that he was on credit for something to that resonated with me and the place\nRolls and your hospitals on the front pending to knock the numbers of men\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school\nAnd all of a sudden to imagine this colleague across time hundred years ago leaving his medical training and being asked to perform medical responsibilities that keeps on credit for something that resonated with me and the place I was in at that time\nWell I mean he he's issued an army issued medical manual that offers advice on building latrines soothing blisters with whale oil and providing moral instructions a soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when he gets there is he hears about what was it might be teeming with maggots just horrifying in churning clumps they teens they stirred like embers\nThese are life as well on every layer of clothing and every stitch and seem\nThey came out upon our combs grainy like wet meal just disgusting because of these ... you know these moist dressings and amputations which he had no idea how to do and enter this nun who teaches him all of this where did you find her\nSo originally I had an imagined her having the role that you eventually had in the story I thought that was just sort of arrived at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical stuff then there'd be a nurse would provide a background role for much like Lew shares\nI found when I encounter she ended up picking over the story and she has very forceful force in the book and I realized eventually but she was going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first dealing with Lucy is who again has arrived at this place he doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with had moons and amputate the split this leg this elbow\nThat for arm that I'm over there we can let the and this soldier loose asks smelling like that\nShe was going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first\nDealing with ... who again has arrived at this place he doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with had moons and amputate the split this leg this elbow that for arm that I'm over there we can let the and this is soldier loses ask smelling like that she says he'll be dead by morning\nDon't worry you didn't do it we keep them warm if he wakes up we tell him he's home because his father you call him son\nYou know right there just a snapshot of\nWho she is and the Washington Post writes she's your most irresistible creation actresses all over Hollywood should be jockeying to play her part in the inevitable movie adaptation were you thinking cinematic Lee because it is I felt as if I was seeing a film as well as reading a story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly cinematic we I think that I'm very drawn to visual images at the time period offers up some extraordinary physical settings\nBecause the sixth place on the Eastern Front it's different than the world war one that I ... in the trenches and the muddy field so ... of Belgium this is different these are these large landscapes across which there's this encounter not only\nWith these modern military armies but also very traditional ones soldiers on horseback ... glances ... this is part of what drew me into the story these very rich visual images from the time\nLoses in fact at one point is lost in the woods and then she's in the middle of a battle on the front it's kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nA lot of the accounts that I read and I tell you\nIf not most of the times of war accounts of battle\nCurrent glances and this is part of what drew me into the story these very rich visual images from the time\n[laughter] loses in fact at one point is lost in the woods and then she's in the middle of a battle on the front it's kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nA lot of the accounts that I read and I'd say many if not most of the kinds of the war accounts of battle\nAnd in that moment when Lucia stumbles into this classic Russian classic advance and a group of Hungarian has ours he realizes that despite the fact that at that point he's been on the front for almost two years he hasn't really seen war itself and the rest of\nThe book really looks at this other aspect of for what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals what's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their mind as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was this psychiatric torment they called it nervous shock\nSure so as a psychiatrist I've been aware that one of the signal injuries of World War one is shell shock\nAnd yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds that couldn't be seen is that some new kind of\nVirus is is a reaction to\nThis new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial thought that there was something about the high explosives that was used during the war is actually sending microscopic particles through the Gulf of the scan it into the brain and causing\nAn injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this this new disease and then\nReaction to this new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial thought that there was something about the high explosives that was used during the war was actually sending microscopic particles through the ... through the skin into the brain and causing\nAn injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure\nAnd here's where we see Lucia is our doctor mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret benign issuing this as a human being who is suffering\nIs this something because you said you relate to a lot to lose just do does this something that yeah transition you went through as a doctor\nIt is I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and that when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go in the words and meet people\nIs very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon\nThere's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact of them on their family and those people who care for them and that and increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is something that looks just go through\nA we just want to touch on the some of the absurdist notion that there was the daughter an old professor Indiana who steals and alleged murder made from a museum because he wants to actually\nCare for them and that and increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is something that moves just go through\nA we just want to touch on the some of the absurdist notions there was the daughter an old professor in Vienna who steals and alleged murder made from a museum because he wants to actually get to see what it is enter a young scientist\nA female scientist by the name of Marie Curie [laughter] who helps with that there was a staffer at the field hospital who was told he had manly hands\nAnd because he thinks they're special he doesn't want to wash them with just caustic soap so he gets dysentery and dies is replaced by another soldier with the same name and does it have serenity to war\nRight and probably to every conflict but particularly to this conflict ... bureaucracy was so expensive and so entrenched\nAnd so slow and reacting to realities about on the ground but the soldiers were in it would often come up against\nThese absurd situations which were horrifying often but at the same time could with the kind of gallows humor that that one and counter them on the front the approach in some ways for some some kind of humor\nThat still have this hour on here now and then of course in twenty minutes it is news hour from the BBC sunny skies

increase by around four to five percent because of destroying the economy but there's a downside the low unemployment rate\nWill make it very hard for stores to find seasonal workers ... senior innovation reporter at W. B. or he joins us now account hijacked and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with pastures\nSo the projection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective a spending usually does grow year over year but the\nAverage growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like Macy's\nRight so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year\nIs way fair the online furniture retail or they are experimenting with temporary\nBrick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they will just be showrooms you can actually buy them there\nHi this is Phil Latzman of thanks for listening to ... online service which is supported by he Leo's education foundation a proud sponsor of the cage aids easy education desk he'll use education

see them in the physical space in that order\nOn line this is the ... model or where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers\nQuite so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days that it's going to increase its minimum pay the Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season on the market research firm weak field of research published a survey last week of a thousand retailers and reported that the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars in forty cents that's a big jump from an average of eleven in Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just above seven dollars an hour or nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on\nGifts could other Retail Federation says it's concerned about those tariffs has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... of the tariffs especially on Chinese imports could make their costs go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers\nOne more thing account big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on\nRight so it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on and investors' minds but of course they're weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury notes considered a very\nSafe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get in the risks\nNotes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on here\nRight so uh it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy\nHard to know exactly what goes on in investors' minds but of course they're weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury notes considered very safe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get in the riskier stock market but if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market\nAnd maybe mortgage rates and other things also start to tick off even more ... of WB or thank you so much glad to be with you\nWell as we heard earlier a vice president Mike Pence took a hard line on China today including stand
