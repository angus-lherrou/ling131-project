four seven auto\nThis this year and now the midterms are three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for predictions tell us what will happen in politics and the economy and technology\nAnd in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future so how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of protection Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's going to happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to our race bat uncertain and one way that we erased uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nWhen the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where we good at it and where we've added\nYou have to our race that uncertainty and one way that we erase uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's gonna happen next\nWhen the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future our weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasts as they always get things wrong yeah ... exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good and so many other domains\nIs it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they do keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise] um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate they are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen and once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make an accurate forecast but very very often when forecasts are made it's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... survey which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part time controller dot com\nOr made it's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting and entertaining\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nAnd one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen right it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to give me a district goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at\nStake what are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies where the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with population bomb by Paul Ehrlich was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humidity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um well it reminds\nMe of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing had\nAsk global starvation within a couple of decades [noise] wrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um\nWell it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kind a yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as the person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know two months ago I said it was going to happen you up\nAnd you know look it's a there's an old saying about the mutual funds you know you start five hundred mutual funds and you to bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit

so\nBraille is becoming more affordable than it's ever been before\nAnd now I'm going to turn to magnification ... the vast majority of blind or visually impaired people have usable vision\nSo out of

dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nWell others are pushing forward in fact they say fighting climate change can be job producing and that we're running out of time according to last week's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change it's just about a decade left to take unprecedented action to reduce the extreme impacts of climate change\nThe report recommends reducing current emission being released into the atmosphere but also capturing the carbon dioxide that's already up there what's known as negative emissions\nLet's take a look with Gregory ... professor of public affairs and environmental studies at the last ... school of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin Madison\nProfessor technologies will be needed to do this but one of the easiest ways to get carbon dioxide out of the plants right because they they just suck it out\nYeah so growing things so using photos synthesis to take field to go to the atmosphere and then store in two would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of you to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing in all of these uh schemes to remove see or to have negative\nActually the editors plants right because they they just stuck it out\nYeah so growing things so using photos synthesis to take C. O. two out of the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of Syria to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing it all of these uh schemes to remove CEO to have negatives have some concerns about them and the biggest one with\nPlanting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with and if it's if that's something else is growing food um that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields and the future\nAnd if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food and using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects of even things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because the scale has to be so large\nWell and also we know that get trees only store ... for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\n[noise] yeah there's a permanent issue with a store and see what two in um injuries that is not such an issue of your stories underground for example okay\nSo let's get some of the other ideas carbon capture storage what are some of the ideas there\nSo the idea with carbon capture traditionally has been you take a\nPower plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now you find a way to collect it\nIn the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid see what you're going into the atmosphere with negative emissions or the way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using debt scheme\nBy again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid CEO to going into the atmosphere with negative emissions there is a way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme\nBy again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy you takes you to that's in the atmosphere photosynthesis will store that CEO to into the crops\nThan you burn the crops in a power plant and instead of putting that suit to back into the atmosphere you're going to do the same thing compress it and stored underground and that has the potential to remove\nA billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground where it tends to be more stable and will stay there\nAs long as we needed to it has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops\nSo for using that land for crops that we're going to use to stores here too and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could a crate and food security issues which is something we want to avoid what did not\nEnd by the way we just said Steven thinkers chicken to knock it his new book at night and it now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on our technologies that we aren't you know we don't even have yet that we're going to come along but we're not just ducking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical processes and you know we've already been doing this and things like submarines or space craft where you need to remove the ... to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd so the ideas could we do that at an industrial scale and capture a C. O. two that's in the air capture that seem to compress it and then store\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical process to use and you know we've already been doing this on things like submarines or space craft where you need to remove the ... to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd so the ideas could we do that at an industrial scale and capture CEO to that's in the air capture that seemed to compress it and then stored underground\nThat is appealing one of the most appealing aspects of that is it doesn't have this large land impact that almost every other one of the schemes has the biggest downside so far has been it's been dismissed as a prohibitively expensive things so\nSomething like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes\nCrime or actually ... started up and they say the conflict between six hundred and eight hundred for magic courtesy of two captured 'em there's another company in Canada and protect crushing you two hundred fifty permit you can write it catches nature\nThat's expensive and just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to over the whole world now I think a number of about five dollars is about right there is other places it's high like in Sweden and then you you've got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about those technology is is the concept come down so as you say claim works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of CEO to\nTheir next plan plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of C. O. two\nThere's another company called carbon engineering in Canada that has thinks it can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there is a U.S company called the global thermostat that uh is doing it the first demonstration in Alabama this year and they think\nTheir next plan plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of C. O. two\nThere's another company called carbon engineering in Canada that has things that can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there is a U.S company called the global thermostat\nThat uh is doing it the first demonstration in Alabama this year\nAnd they think that will be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get it down to a hundred after that so this idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it it seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built\nWithout severe problems and with costs that seem to be starting to come down so there is a potential\nTo really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have the land use impacts one of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of CEO to by mid century\nUm and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned that's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I\nI think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies but that really doesn't\nFit with the scale the challenger facing so that's that's the real challenge for direct heir captures how you scale up from three companies doing on the order of five or six plants to something like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten years\n[laughter] and he found well are you getting the investors excited about that\nThat that may be the future but again Steven Pinker writes sat there more speculative and as this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse pulverized rock it takes up CEO tuition weather's too at alkaline clouds of the oceans to dissolve more CEO to either one\nPlants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or\nTen years six hundred thousand well are you getting the investors excited about that\nThat that may be the future but look again Steven Pinker writes that the more speculative end of this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse pulverized rock it takes up CEO tuition weather's too at alkaline clouds of the oceans to dissolve more CEO to either water\nFertilize the ocean with iron to accelerate photosynthesis like plankton and again success CEO two out of the atmosphere in different ways what do you say though\nTo how her job I'm a fellow of seeing things at MIT who says in the fact that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing at sea of two emissions if people start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes called uh the jargon you turn for his moral hazard this idea that if you have this technology available it's kind of like an insurance policy and then you'll engage in risky behavior and in this case it means you won't reduce emissions are enough\nI I actually think we're not we don't really have the the luxury of dismissing this negative emotions technology is something that I'm able to take away our incentives I mean it's kind of like you know an insurance policy for a house insurance or fire insurance or something like that where\nYeah maybe there is a sense in which if you have the insurance there'll be less careful about fires in your house but on the other hand most people still want to have a insurance because it's it's worth it to them and it's worth it to society and I think that's kind of the way we have to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "15"}
