of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some of the group's steady groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah uh and this of course one of those popular courses or a computer science courts that that has actually ... where the students are scheduled to work all night as part of the course and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean\nThe football team has been getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled\nIn many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say they'd o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is just shut up for the students staying up all\nThe extend this to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing

screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets our circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock sends the strongest strive for waking just before what would be dusk a so during evolution a we couldn't see during the night time\nAnd the brand send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together and being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside\nAnd when we decide to switch off so much\nWell this that we we talked about some of the health issues that arise disrupts sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWell I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes a nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and deaths\nWell any Matthew Walker he's book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ads for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer dementia in wars of cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and strokes notch mentioned diabetes are you interested\nWell in and Matthew Walker his book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ads for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim\nProtects you from cancer dementia in wars of cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and strokes notch mentioned diabetes are you interested well of course it's sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you\nKnow your appetite I mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcomes\nAnd lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nWell part of the programs are we caught sleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that um that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on their sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team though shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more failing all free throws in and one of the things that students don't realize is it is not just the amount of sleep but consistency in the\nTiming of sleep so students have irregular schedules\nThey don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nImprove their reaction time if they're on a sports team they'll shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more ... free throws in one of the things that students don't realize is that it's not just the amount of sleep that consistency in the timing of sleep so students have irregular schedules\nThey don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we studied Harvard students we found that those who have irregular schedules even if they got the same duration of sleep and inconsistent times\nThey were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder\nThat they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWell so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep money maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am\nI right so when I had been teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seminar have to make its head like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity\nSchool sanctioned activity on the first\nAh scheduled activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you working now we're talking to you most specifically about students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers firefighters he took his program what twenty four percent less likely to report an injury you have as many disability days and you can trace\nDid that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you working now we're talking to you most specifically that students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters who took his probably twenty four percent less likely to report an injury you have as many disability days I mean you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post some of the sit here and now dot org\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shift there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we met at a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour a new one detail so we did a sleep disorder screening for example\nFor ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires away identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea or chronic insomnia or other disorders and we were for them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and one out of six women\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep is you can't breathe and sleep at the same time\nYou're not going to get the rest of that you need\nAnd when we first came to present to them\nThey made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the session a or kidding everybody say oh I got to have my sleep session and so on but then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people to have this information to understand\nThat untreated sleep apnea for example after Eighteen years only fifty eight percent of them are still alive as opposed to Ninety four percent of their without sleep apnea because it increases the risk of cardiovascular death by four hundred and twenty percent and we've had\n... to understand

meant to move both men and the heavy weapons out of the this new DMZ that they've\nBeen put together by the Turks and the and the Russians so you know we'll see but it's up to now according to the ... of course have a stake in things going well [noise] uh up to now they appear to be moving and\nHappened is that if it if let's say it's a a Syrian group that rose up you know against the Assad regime during the Arab Spring before radical groups came in from elsewhere and you know kind of fill the vacuum there if it's the Syrians what happens when they start leaning that area aren't they going to be targeted\nThe estimate is being used by the un is Ninety thousand men who carry guns are into an all of that Fifteen to twenty thousand a ... you might call die Haji hobbies I think that this what the DMZ does it basically postpones dealing with the issue\nWill meantime here you are in the front lines where did you see there including a troops that apparently didn't want to be seen\nOr with the

these people go they either have become refugees in these ... mostly empty towns or had been killed\nWhile I wondered every time I saw yet another empty town of ... ... what was happening to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it looked at all and I think some will be dead and others will be inside at the city itself\nI'd be ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a ... to deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up and they offered them a way out whether they would be bus stop to it lip\nAnd that's why they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive around that area as we did and we talked to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThat the war to in the hot out of the country and it has done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also [noise]\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you if if you're in the central Damascus it looks like nothing

looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus do you go to places like the area rounded lip than\nYou can really see walk the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nWell so what do you think happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamic militias along with them that if you know taken advantage of the situation there you have the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back Kurd and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand

there will be the end of this sort of the civil war\nBut you've got a you know U.S interests Iranian interest Russian interest a Turkish interests what do you anticipate happens now\nA century the
