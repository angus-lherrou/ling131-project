I guess what you're going to probably find out you got challenges going on with their other parts of your system\nYou're the river keeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river bay mean to them and you will get\nYou will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers

brook and Roy ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr Coleman that question we started with why do we care about this I'd say the most spectacular\nFishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all its nutrients is not coming down into the salad needed water and coming down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with salt water is that encourages these marine credits is such an oyster drills and ground clock\nAbout these oyster drills that sounds like a horror film duct duct to tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like come out\nA sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot you can do about it it is rather horrific\nCheck it out on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish let's start with the day and a an ecosystem because if we don't address\nIn and basically consume news from within and there's not a whole lot you can do about it is rather efficacy\nI'll check it out on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bay wasn't just shut down so that it could replenish let's start\nWith the day and a an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if we're constantly reacting one of the things that happened\nThe wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and harvest all the moisture is the fear was that the spill would come in and ... a couple of years later and there was no brood stock left there to re populated I think about the functions that moisture surface is beyond\nThe economics they clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race or she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with the bay over the last few decades has been reaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that\nPaul ... is the voice stir shell what the larval oysters settled on but\nDistributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all into the wind what would you recommend I mean we haven't even mentioned climate change and the droughts that have been a part of

coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be fair particular types of research that could be done that could\nRelatively quickly and the next couple of years to make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what she made it but they want their livelihood restored\nSo there's a tendency to go for whatever ... looks like the quickest fix closing the best probably not a terrible idea and I think you would find fishermen that fully support that full Dr Bruce ... research and really a committed

colleagues have been really pulling at this threat is quite a story Michael ... fall more than two weeks ago\nBut so many people still displaced do we know how many\nRight when we last spoke with FEMA they told me there are more than a thousand people in shelters at this point and of course we know that not everyone who was displaced by the storm are are those people in the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater than that you know thousand or so people\nWill somebody with family or friends or in cars uh your colleague Lynn had her spoke with ... she was evicted from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm damage was listen\nI'm actually currently living in my truck [laughter]\n[laughter]\nI really like [laughter] like I Want [laughter] [laughter]\nSo you multiply her I'm sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who I don't have any recourse she got a C ... rental assistance\nAnd his waiting on a check 'em but but then what I mean where she's supposed to she can find housing but we're supposed to find housing\nThat's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for a house\nShe has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got to see ... rental assistance and his waiting on a check 'em but but then what I mean where she's supposed ... she can find housing but we're supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers said that you can use to stay these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there\nReally there's about twenty that are accepting vouchers\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers\nBut there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here\nWe come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seen sort of this slow response there also shelter is of course yeah well it will ah and by the way we see FEMA people all over the place\nIn their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter and local high school and just want to listen to how\nWe say we're in charge and maybe it was just like all the windows busted out back and [noise] all the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah [noise] um I haven't yet her house was destroyed a brother in law is houses destroyed you know I'll do it while some rooms\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this is driven home we're in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes are not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more rural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are\nOh well so first of all clarify for us because driving around this is driven home or in the panhandle people might be picturing you know Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes are not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance\nWhich will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Mickey Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing

Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process so that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state\nBut again that's difficult for is a fisherman who maybe

it up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing again in the five six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal\nAnd as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it a Tom said perhaps corn cob a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old ... here but it's conceivable so so that'll be that'll be the excitement this afternoon as removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal and it's [noise]\n\nThe scraped material is dumped into the buckets and poured

importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently excavated and that's really why we were so very concerned is that we have an open excavation pit almost a meter deep with soils that have not seen the letter day for the better part of nine thousand years we've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing and we we got off awfully\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by Amanda devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and

the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologists Kelvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's when some of the most important earliest finds were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a real barrel of loan delivered to his home and he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this dirt is more than dirt is part of this ancient burial site you know\nThey had a delivery of Sirte and within the ... there were\nThat is archaeologist Barbara clause of the\nFlorida public archaeology network and we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of long meeting to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean uh how how high near would you say this ...\nThis is the tallest up the southern mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound\nThis site is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture\nOh how how high near would you say this ... this is the tallest\nUp to seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mounts were built basket by basket load of dirt and let's just backup\nWhat exactly is the mound this site is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture\nKnown by many as the mount builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain a hut when that person past they would then be interred are buried in the mountains and their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time it became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burned homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pie or is that it's a\nPlace that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today it's definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climb stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would have done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nOr their native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who lived here the descendants of the\nPeople who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we are not climbing the [noise] the wouldn't stairs up\nWho are direct descendants of the people who lived here studs\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we're not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking\nSince the year one thousand ADD these mouths and we're right on top now these mounts have weathered when did a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the mountain and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains here we are ready on top\nOf the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community we'd get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have a lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other sites similar to this throughout the southeast all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at least Jackson\nThey were finding copper breast plates or ... ... we don't have proper in Florida so it was evidence of trade with
