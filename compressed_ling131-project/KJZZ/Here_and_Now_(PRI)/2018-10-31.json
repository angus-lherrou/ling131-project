sandwiched in between motherhood and apple pie\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom than some legal experts at this time is different [noise] Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans\nThem in an almost even split between the two parties says oh and fruit and\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this you're every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not Emory cameras was on this year's commission on the committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not a play just plain logic so when we\nFirst started meeting we

example of amendment ... which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment where from me and and and protect our state and protect our citizens\nI think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beams and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\nCamus says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue just make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters\nTimothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible\nSaw the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled

being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay justice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give

weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws\nJoining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome yeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other\nYears overall the total number a statewide measure is has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a signature petition signed by registered voters and\nIn those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that than just gets referred to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there's a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections\nAnd voting yeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting marijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years\nUm but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections\nAnd voting yeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year ... other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter ID A campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThat process varies by state the number of signatures required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be Jane Q\nVoter there are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group of national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on the ballot\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something has put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process is a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as a U.S\nEat legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process there's a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove that rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process of used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty six initiatives was\nIn many cases to either repeal or I'm changing the initiatives if possible and some states allow that some don't\nOr to pass restrictions on the process and then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty Eighteen with an issue proponents instead of\nLetting it go to the ballot and letting it'd be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where an issue opponents withdraw and the policy still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it\nDon't or to pass restrictions on the process and then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty eight team with an issue proponents instead of\nLetting it go to the ballot and letting it'd be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where an issue opponents withdraw and the policy still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it what\nAnd later we'll get a look at a new Broadway play called life span of a fact which asks the question what is a fact and it's all coming up here

to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did they needed was to that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in the special counsel's office that it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell there are two conservative media personalities capable and jak Berkman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friends supporter Chris Ruddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call\nThe crimes or the finality involving the

kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified a because no one knows which things in it a true and which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this

book thanks for having John's back\nOh I can talk about that when your character John ... always saying things like yeah there are thirty one strip clubs that thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or news conference\nBetween it as a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs really different to be the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play\nWhere there is a difference in in an artistic peace being written and that's it you know what would you say about the Greek histories what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four because you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously to set your character is not a bad guy we're in real life cycle\nThat guy anyway he's just he's a writer recon aren't\nReal life he he has said that the real writer who said oh my God I'm

articles for the New York times he's he's illuminating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that falls in a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say to all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character

there's a whole world of facts to choose from the wrong facts given the way of the story and your tests or says the wrong time what does that mean exactly\nWhat you gotta be aware that we have a presidential spokes person Kellyanne Conway you spoke of alternative facts are not very\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and\nIt frequently gets applause the argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in it the whole thing can for the policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where they were debating about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is kind of going oh come on clearly you are going to follow this you know the difference that math is you know Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it drew a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating certain play do you think will start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense\nDo both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of fact and cherry again there you are in the middle talked about the physicality on the stage I mean there's the\nI mean

the day I had\nNational international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven out of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they are and I do not is because one state the ... does not have the house and Senate they only have one\nChamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why our Republican so dominant at the state level\nWill will with the straight answer that they'd been successful in previous elections they've run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history and what isn't\nThree consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what is that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had\nThese very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also to\nOutside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape in the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines that were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty censuses right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's all right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled\nIn less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as\nThirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions and two thousand and Twenty one\nBut I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impacts throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\n... from the very beginning we knew that this would be sort of a democratic\nOpportunity year they would have the wind at their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of our legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where their base\nThe crowds chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be that a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nOn for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics is you'll find anywhere which is ... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're printing into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nUh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know\nIs they do know that they're going to vote for either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and and a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment\nI'm very few people know who their state legislator who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and um and then to your point it then it does sort of turn into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's also and about so um [noise] you know this\nThere there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's all about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle particular on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects\nUm get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you now see\nFairly commonly in pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they just increased fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago they are now paying a lot more attention\nSupported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they just increased fairly substantially for they were just a few years ago there now paying a lot more attention to the state races but both parties are going all
