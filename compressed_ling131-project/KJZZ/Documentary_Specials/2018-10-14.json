I'm Emily Hanford\n[noise] it was twenty Fifteen and jak sailed a had a problem\nHe's the chief academic officer for the public schools in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and a lot of kids in his schools were not reading well only fifty six percent of third graders were scoring proficient on the state reading test or I didn't I didn't know what to do he knew nothing about how kids learn to read or how reading should be taught\nBut he did know that even some older students were struggling with pretty basic stuff when it came to reading\nI was in middle school and high school teacher for many years and I could see students who had difficulty with breaking down individual words\nThey come across a word they'd never seen before and have no idea how to sound it out Kim harbor noticed the same thing she was a high school English teacher in Bethlehem and she says a disturbing number of her students were not very good readers even students in honors classes\nThey didn't like to read they avoided reading they would tell me it was too hard\nShe didn't know what to do about it either so she kind of shrug it off\nI think it became easy to say well that's just the way it is and you're always going

[noise] it's just the way things were\nIt was always well that's not a reflection of Bethlehem that's a portion of us\nMike ... is president of the Bethlehem school board\nWill you know those kids are parents aren't around or maybe they don't have to parents or one pair tomato a grandmother and that's the best way to do\nIt's true that the districts poorer schools had the worst reading scores there are lots of low income families here but there are a fancy homes here too\nAnd when she's academic officer jak sale though was examining the reading scores he saw there were plenty of kids at the wealthier schools not reading very well either this was not just poverty since he knew nothing about reading he started searching online\nThere's a whole lot of research about how kids learn to read there are thousands of studies\nThis is Luis ... she's been teaching and researching reading since the Nineteen seventies this is the most studied aspect of human learning one of the many things researchers have learned over the years is that virtually all kids can learn to read [noise] researchers have done studies in classrooms and clinics and\nShown over and over that somewhere between one and six percent of kids have such severe learning disabilities that they will probably always struggle with reading but everyone else can learn to read if they are taught [noise]\nThe problem is lots of kids aren't being taught at least not in ways that line up with what science says about how children learn to read the result more than six intend for us\nSomewhere between one and six percent of kids have such severe learning disabilities that they will probably always struggle with reading but everyone else can learn to read if they are taught [noise]\nThe problem is lots of kids aren't

thirty million adults struggle to read a basic passage of text and this is not just a poverty problem one third of struggling readers are from college educated families\n[noise]\nFrom a PM reports this is hard words why aren't are kids being taught to read kids who struggled to read are more likely to drop out of high school they're more likely to end up in the criminal justice system they're more likely to live in\nDetailed identification of letters and words instead the theory goes\nDetailed identification of letters and words\nInstead the theory goes when readers comfortable where they don't know they use context to figure out what the word is so if a child gets stuck on a word she's told re read the sentence think about a word that would make sense and the sentence look at the pictures she's told that's what good readers do\nBut in fact that's not what good readers do studies that compare skilled readers to pour readers show that poor readers gas when they come to a word they don't know because they have difficulty decoding\nWhen skilled readers come to a war they don't know they rapidly identify the sounds and letters in the word\nGood readers may guess at the meaning of the word but they don't guess at the print on the page [noise]\nWe're going back to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania now where balance literacy was the prevailing approach to reading instructions until the district got serious about trying to do something about all those kids who are struggling with reading point [noise]\nIs Cathy vast she's walking the halls of calypso elementary where she's the principal\nBack in twenty Fifteen when Bethlehem realized it needed to change the way it taught reading district leaders decided the first step would be a series of trainings for all the principles at the district sixteen elementary schools over the course of an entire school year the principles we're going to be taught the reading science\nAs it happened Kathy bass was out on medical leave when the trainings began but our colleagues warned her they said to me Cathy we know you you're not going to take well to this\nWhen Bethlehem realized it needed to change the way it taught reading district leaders decided the first step would be a series of trainings for all the principles at the district sixteen elementary schools over the course of an entire school year the principles we're going to be taught the reading science\nAs it happened Kathy bass was out on medical leave when the trainings began but our colleagues warned her\nThey said to me Cathy we know you you're not going to take well to this training\nThe principles we're learning about the importance of explicitly teaching children how to decode words and everyone was sure Kathy bass was going to resist\nThey knew who I was and how reading with a passion and the decoding was never part of anything I ever did but ... had a secret\n[noise] even though she was known as the districts number one balance literacy champion\nShe had doubts before becoming a principal Kathy bass had been a reading specialist it was her job to help struggling readers\nIn her training to become a reading specialist she says she learned a lot about how to identify\nA child with a reading problem but she learned nothing about how to help a child actually learn to read I didn't know what to do except just gives them more books\nAnd it wasn't working with time on our hands while she was on medical leave ... bass to begin reading about reading and she discovered the vast scientific literature when\nShe returned to work for medical even joined her fellow principles and the trainings on the reading science she was ready to hear what the trainer had to say and it kind of blew her mind while we do cave let's go get at this\nThe training of principles we're doing used a curriculum written by Luis ... votes you heard her earlier the curriculum is called language essential for teachers of reading and spelling or letters for short the principles went through the training and twenty Fifteen the kindergarten teachers went through it the next year than the districts first and second grade teachers did that\nBlue her mind while we do cave let's go get at this the training of principles we're doing used curriculum written by Lewis I'm most you heard her earlier the curriculum is called language essential for teachers of reading and spelling or letters for short\nThe principles went through the training and twenty Fifteen to kindergarten teachers went through it the next year than the districts first and second grade teachers did the training I got to sit in on it for part of the day\nEveryone the training was led by Mary Jo ... she's an educational consultant which word doesn't begin with the same sound\nFor children's a clearly understand how letters represent speech sounds they need to be able to hear the speech sounds and teachers do too it's not always easy to tell me the first sound you hear in unit [noise]\nYes before you get to the ... how about Charlotte ...\nOnce kids can isolate the sounds in a word there next task is to understand how letters represent those sounds in English we have forty four different speech sounds or phonemes each phone him is represented by a letter or combinations of letters\nResearch shows when kids are explicitly taught how letters represent phonemes they become better readers\nBut phonics isn't enough kids can learn to decode words without knowing what the words mean to comprehend what they're reading kids need a good vocabulary to scientists came up with a model\nExplain the relationship between a person's ability to decode tax and their ability to comprehend what they're reading [noise] scientists called it the simple\n\nBut phonics isn't enough kids can learn to decode words without knowing what the words mean to comprehend what they're reading kids need a good vocabulary to scientists came up with a model to explain the relationship between a person's ability to decode tax\nAnd their ability to comprehend what they're reading [noise] scientists called it the simple view of reading and it's basically a math formula\nIt says this reading comprehension equals the coding skills\nTimes language comprehension\nLanguage comprehension is what develops naturally in children when people talk to them there's just lived through ... through space is deep coating is well kids have to be taught\n[noise]\nSome kids learn decoding quickly and easily others need much more instruction but a child who can't decode will never be a good reader because of that math formula zero times anything is zero\nIn their training on the science of reading the teachers and principals in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania learned about the simple view of reading and a lot more there's quite a bit to know about the structure of the English language to be able to teach it to little kids\nI sat down with three teachers who are in the first group to go through the training in Bethlehem I asked them what it was like at first\nI remember sitting there and like my head was throbbing 'cause it was like how can I take all of this and oh my God I'm never going to be able to use or I don't know how to use this and then them constantly saying you're going to get there you're going to get there going to get there\nThat was Adrian I Berra and candy molten auto they hadn't learned any of this in their teacher preparation programs neither had teacher Michelle both act\nWas very broad classes vague classes and like a children's literature class but not actually\nHow can I take all of this in oh my God I'm never going to be able to use or I don't know how to use is and then them constantly saying you're going to get there you're going to get that you're going to get there\nThat was Adrian I beret and candy mold in auto they hadn't learned any of this in their teacher preparation programs neither had teacher Michelle both act\nIt was very broad classes vague classes and like a children's literature class but not actually teaching phonics and things like that\nWhen they became teachers they did a little of what they thought was phonics candy mold and NATO says it pretty much went like this\nSo like we did like a letter a week so if the letter was a we read books about a week things with a we found things with a and then but we never did anything else with it like we all we did was learned like a said ads and then there's apples and we teach that Apple's\nWhen you were all being taught to use that way and teaching that way what was the idea about how children learn to read\nDid you have a sense of that you know now that I think about it no not really it was just that they do [laughter] almost like it's automatic yeah\nWhen these teachers started the training on the science of reading they felt overwhelmed by the time they were done they felt guilty they thought all these years all these students I feel horrible guilt the Bethlehem school district has adopted a motto to help ease the guilt when we know better we do better\nWhen I went to kindergarten class at Bethlehem calypso elementary school this is Cathy vast school the principal everyone thought was going to resist the reading science but didn't her kindergarten teachers got the science of reading training last year now they're putting it into practice\nGlobal\nJust cutting the sound off guys the entire class is seated on a carpet while as students\nI ... for listing decay Jay Z's audio service which is supported by the UAE Eller

ever had\nMy kids are successful and happy and believe in themselves I don't have a single child in my room that has that look on their face like I Can't do that is\nThe Barksdale reading Institute went to state education officials and said you have to do something about this and in two thousand three in a rather extraordinary move the state department of education mandated that every teacher preparation program in Mississippi require two courses on early literacy to\nCover what was in the national reading panel report [noise]\nIt was extraordinary because even though states have the authority to regulate teacher preparation programs\nThey rarely tell them what to teach in their classes higher education\nDoes not like to be told what to do this is Kelly Butler again professors pretty much have academic freedom to construct learning in the way they think best\nFaculty members closed the door and do whatever the heck they will too\nThat's Angela Rutherford she is a faculty member at the University of Mississippi she works with the bar still reading Institute she knows the reading science and she says a lot of her colleagues and teacher preparation programs don't they believe in whole language\nWhat they believe I had a colleague challenge me and her question was well you know what do you believe I said I Believe what I see in research\nOf Mississippi she works with the bar still reading Institute she knows the reading science and she says a lot of her colleagues and teacher preparation programs don't they believe in whole language\nThat's what they believe I had a colleague challenge me and her question was well you know what do you believe I said I Believe what I see in research\nOnce when Kelly Butler was talking to a dean about the reading science the deans said to her is this your science or my science is this your science or my science\n[noise] that's what Kelly Butler and her colleagues were up against [noise] they want it to change what prospective teachers in Mississippi were learning about reading state officials did too but Kelly Butler says many deans and faculty still believed in whole language well fast forward\nTo twenty Fifteen and we now have all of her she dies promotion act\nThe state legislature had passed a law called the literacy based promotion act the law says that kids who are not reading on grade level by the end of third grade cannot move on to fourth grade\nWhat that precipitated was re training of teachers because we knew that teachers really didn't know enough about what to do\nThe teachers are already working in Mississippi schools started learning the reading\nScience but what about the new teachers just graduating from teacher prep programs if they weren't learning the science the state would be spending money forever training teachers at this point no one really knew what aspiring teachers were actually learning in those required early literacy classes\nSo in twenty Fifteen the bark still reading Institute decided to repeat the study had done back in two thousand three this time private colleges were included Fifteen teacher prep programs over all\nThe new news some Kelly Butler says\nBe spending money forever training teachers at this point no one really knew what aspiring teachers were actually learning in those required early literacy classes\nSo in twenty Fifteen the bark still reading Institute decided to repeat the study had done back in two thousand three this time private colleges were included Fifteen teacher prep programs over all\nThe new news some Kelly Butler says with one exception [noise] all the states teacher prep programs for\nNow teaching the five components of reading the deans and faculty all said they'd heard of the national reading panel report but most of them had not read it she learned to other things that shocked her when I interviewed both faculty and students\nAnd asked them particular questions about the science of reading for example where they familiar with something called the simple view of reading that that formula scientists came up with to explain that reading comprehension is a product of your ability to decode taxed times all the words you know the meaning of\nNot a single one that I talked to had ever heard of the simple if you've read which has been around since Nineteen eighty six and\nThe science have been around for a long time the state had been requiring colleges to teach the science\nFor more than a decade and still perspective teachers weren't learning it [noise] so the state legislature decided to do something else it started requiring teacher candidates to pass a test on the reading science if you don't pass the foundations of reading test\nYou don't get licensed to teach elementary school in Mississippi [noise]\n... yeah\nSo the American shows\nWere backing letters training with the college faculty and Mississippi there in Paris now working on funny Mick awareness skills this is ... Harris Alan ... and you heard them earlier what is the earth\nFoundations of reading test you don't get license to teach elementary school in Mississippi [noise]\n... yeah\nI saw\nWere backing letters training with the college faculty and Mississippi there in Paris now working on Sunday Mick awareness skills this is ... Harris Alan ... and you heard them earlier\nWhat is the first they reach down\n[laughter] very\nCollege faculty and Mississippi are not required to do letters training but it isn't the best interest of those who teach the early literacy classes since their students will not become license teachers unless they pass the foundations of reading test\nI interviewed several of the women in this training there were all women I was expecting to hear resistance and resignation about being here but\nI didn't as I'm sitting in there I'm thinking I'm gonna do this and classics weaker oh man I Wish I had done that don't have to make a note you know to do this next semester\nThat was Kim Smith of Mississippi State and this is Barbara Bolling of the University of southern Mississippi\nI feel blessed to be part of this change\nThey were elementary school teachers before they became college instructors they didn't know the reading science when they were teachers and they're grateful to be learning it now\nI think that we all agree though that this is right or the best practices and maybe we're here because of that and the whole language ones are not here because I think they would really rude resists\nThe faculty who believe in whole language didn't seem to be here I had to look for them I found two professors at the University of southern Mississippi willing to talk to me ah my name is Stacy read\nAnd associate professor\nOf that and the whole language ones are not here because I think they would earlier resists\nThe faculty who believe in whole language didn't seem to be here I had to look for them I found two professors at the University of southern Mississippi willing to talk to me\nAh my name is Stacy raves and an associate professor of literacy and other areas of elementary and\nI'm Mary aerial I'm a professor or in the department of curriculum instruction special education\nMary aerial had actually been the chair of the department until a few months before our interview she in Stacy read both told me they had no interest in going to the letters training this is Stacey reads\nI Am philosophically opposed to jumping on the bandwagon of the next great thing that's going to teach every child how to learn to read phonics for me is not that answer\nShe says she knows this from her own experience she was in elementary school teacher before she got her PHD it was the early Nineteen nineties\nHer students did phonics worksheets and then got these little books called ... readers that contained words with the letter patterns they've been practicing sentences like the bad rap hid in the tin can\nThey were boring repetitive that as soon as I sat down with my first graders and read a book like fraud and told her friends they were instantly engaged in the story\nShe says she ditched the phonics work books and the Dakota will readers and once\nStarted teaching in a more whole way more encompassing way of the whole child what does this child and eat what does that child and eat let's read more real books Whistler right more real language about your life once did that\nBrought into their friends they were instantly engaged in the story she says she ditched the phonics work books and the Dakota will readers and once I started teaching in a more whole way more encompassing way of the whole child what does this child and eat what does that child and eat let's read more real\nBook Whistler right more real language about your life once did that my teaching improve the students learn more I feel I feel they cannot the other side much better\nStacey Reeves says for students seemed more engaged but she admits she had no evidence they were learning better [noise]\nOne of the central tenets of the whole language movement is that teachers are best able to judge whether their students are learning not standardized tests\nAnother key idea is that all children learn differently and need to be taught in different ways but that's not true with reading\nOur brains are much more similar than they are different\nAnd we all need to learn the same things to change or non reading brains into reading brains some of us learned to read more quickly and easily than others but everyone reads in basically the same way\nOne of the most consistent findings in all of education research is that children become better readers when they get explicit and systematic phonics instruction\nDakota readers would let her patterns maybe boring and repetitive for adults but they help children learn to read\nMary aerial the former chair of the curriculum and special ed department at the University of southern Mississippi remains unconvinced she's against explicit phonics instruction\nShe thinks it can be helpful to do some phonics with kids as they're reading books maybe prompt them to sound something out to notice a letter pattern in a word but she thinks kids will be distracted from understanding the meaning of what they're\nMary

helpful to do some phonics with kids as they're reading books maybe prompt them to sound something out to notice a letter pattern in a word but she thinks kids will be distracted from understanding the meaning of what they're reading if teachers focus too much on how words are made up of letters\nWhat it really does it makes it harder because we are trying to make meaning of it and when you you're teaching these meaningless symbols that it is actually making it harder so breaking it down into pieces makes it ... makes it harder to learn to read\nA that's the idea that's one of the the ideas of concepts behind her language is that it's that's when it's meaningful it's easy and when it's broken down into little parts and makes it harder so okay so so from your perspective how do kids learn to read [noise]\nWell I think kids learn to read in different ways um a lot of children come to school already reading because they had been immersed in print rich environment is from the time they were born\nThe underlying belief here is the reading comes naturally when children are read to end surrounded by books\nMary aerial sees the effort to change reading instruction in Mississippi as an example of lawmakers telling educators what to do and she doesn't like it she actually left her job shortly after our interview in part because of her frustration over what's happening with reading
