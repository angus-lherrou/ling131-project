support for the concerns of ordinary people populism is not about right versus left\nBut it's about top versus bottom how do we fight against a society that benefits\nThe privilege the elites now there are many forms of populism Donald Trump has his form of populism rhetoric but his populism as right wing white nationalist populism he chooses to divide you\nPopulism is not about right versus left\nBut it's about top versus bottom how do we fight against a society that benefits\nThe privilege the elites now there are many forms of populism Donald Trump has his form of populism rhetoric but his populism as right wing white nationalist populism he chooses to divide\nUsing race religion immigration status and gender progressive populism unified and brings us all together\nThe late Senator Paul Wellstone used to say we all do better when we all do better\nWe also have to talk about the power of systems that are created to benefit the privilege and beliefs and I'm Talking about white supremacy I'm Talking about patriarchy Islamophobia what permissive populism does its fights against that it says no to that\nNow how do we move forward my parents were immigrants my dad was in New York City cabdriver my mom a home health care aide the issues that matter to them also mattered to their white working class counterparts\nProgressive populism have solutions are solutions are actually incredibly popular\nFor example Medicare for all lake research did a survey back in April and asked voters in battleground congressional districts how they felt about Medicare for all fifty\nFour percent strongly support Medicare for all but I think the most interesting thing about that survey was that Democrats who are infrequent voters it was more popular with them\nAnd we also believe in the auto bailout which was incredibly successful thank you Steve Rattner and it was a great example of how government when they step into activism can really help the markets but now want to talk about candidates the first one is better work he's running in Texas don't trust\nWas that Democrat who are infrequent voters it was more popular with them\nAnd we also believe in the auto bailout which was incredibly successful thank you Steve Rattner and it was a great example of how government when they step into activism can really help the markets but now I Want to talk about candidates the first one is better all work he's running in Texas\nDonald Trump won Texas by nine points\nBetter Rourke as authentic he's fighting for the people he's progressive he's not taking pac money's not taking corporation money and he's doing really well in that race Wendy Davis who lost the governor's race a couple of years ago by twenty points said that she would run a more progressive campaign if she were to do it again\nAndrew Gillum incredibly progressive making history\nAnd he came out in the general election has been leading in all of the polls in Florida ... one that my one or two points\nAll the past democratic candidates who were who are in the middle have never done as well and he's doing right now look it's not going to be up to us who are on stage that is going to decide what the Democratic Party is going to do it's going to be up to activists\nAnd voters out across the country and they're making it loud and clear they want the Democratic party to challenge the status quo and to fight for the Ninety nine percent not the one percent\n[noise] regulation progressive hospitals and they say the Democratic party here to make\nHis statement against the motion please welcome Steven Rattner chairman and CEO of Willett advisors and\nFormer counselor for the secretary of treasury [noise]\nAnd I consider myself a progressive and I consider myself as a fighter for the Ninety nine percent of our sector should be defined I Believe that our tax system excessively favors the rich I Believe that income inequality in our country is reprehensible levels and must be addressed I Believe that the federal government should lean in\nChairman and CEO of Willett advisors and former counselor to the secretary of treasury [noise]\nAnd I consider myself a progressive and I consider myself as a fighter for the Ninety nine percent as I think it should be defined I Believe that our tax system excessively favors the rich\nI Believe that income inequality in our country has a reprehensible levels and must be addressed I Believe that the federal government should lean in and try to solve the pressing problems of those who have been left behind\nBut I don't believe that endorsing policy ideas that are either unaffordable would somehow be good politics for the Democratic party there has not been a single Democratic president elected in our history\nEspousing the kinds of policies that the proponents of this motion advocate not FDR ran in Nineteen thirty two on a platform of balancing the budget not John F. Kennedy for by the way cut taxes for the rich\nCertainly not Bill Clinton and not even Brock Obama who Senator Sanders attack this week for not pushing more progressive policies then there are other losers\nGeorge McGovern who carry just one state and the district of Columbia Nineteen Seventy two in Nineteen eighty four Walter Mondale suffered exactly the same faith all of us up here agree that the election of Donald Trump was one of the saddest days of our lifestyle [noise]\nAnd\nWith an approval rating hovering around forty three percent there's no way he should be re elected but if we want to make the unimaginable imaginable just nominate someone out of touch with the mainstream of this country\nRemember that only thirty three percent of Americans are even Democrats at all the share of independence at thirty seven percent is the highest and twenty seven years\nYou've heard the suggestion that Bernie Sanders could have eaten Donald Trump will never know but we do know a few things the fact that democratic voters are increasingly concentrated geographically particularly in big blue states like New York and California so to when we must reach out more moderate voters\nThirty three percent of Americans are even Democrats at all the share of independence ... thirty seven percent is the highest and twenty seven years\nYou've heard the suggestion that Bernie Sanders could have eaten Donald Trump will never know\nBut we do know a few things the fact that democratic voters are increasingly concentrated geographically particularly in big blue states like New York and California so to when we must reach out to more moderate voters in Pennsylvania in Michigan and in Wisconsin three states that we never should have lost\nYou've heard turnout blamed for Secretary Clinton's loss but it's sixty point one percent turnout was higher in two thousand and sixteen than it was for Brock Obama's re election in two thousand and twelve now let's turn to policy guarantee a Fifteen dollar an hour income to all that would cost on the order of six hundred eighty billion dollars annually\nExpand Social Security that sounds pretty good until Americans understand that the trust fund is on track to go broke and twenty thirty four and jeopardize the benefits that we've already promised make public colleges tuition free is just suggest that it's a great goal for the under privileged\nBut if any of my kids were to go to a public institution I have no idea why they should get a free ride break up the big banks that sounds appealing although apparently not Mr Sanders Senate colleagues\nNone of them have signed on as co sponsors of his bill abolish ice only thirty two percent of voters want that wall fifty three percent understand that immigration and customs service albeit with reforms is something that we need to have\nI share the goals of the populace but we should address the critical issues facing our nation by putting forward responsible prudent policies that will attract a coalition of voters that we need to keep Donald Trump from another four years of destroying America thank you\nThank you Steve and Ron Ron with us to be [noise]\nWe live on around too and in round two the debaters address one another directly and they take questions for me and from you\nThe critical issues facing our nation by putting forward responsible proven policies that will attract the coalition of voters that we need to keep Donald Trump from another four years of destroying America thank you\nThank you Steven Rattner and that can run one of the u._s. debate [noise]\nNow we live on around too and in round two of the debaters address one another directly and they take questions from me and from you our live audience here in New York City\nWhat we seem to be hearing about is a dispute over how\nMany voters will respond to the set of policies that are identified with progressive populism the team arguing for the resolution ... and Jeff Weaver they described in this country a sense of emergency in light of things like seeing a phobia and ultra nationalism and racism\nA tension between top and bottom and in that framework they say these are solutions\nThat appeal to the bottom ideas like Medicaid for all free public college tuition abolishing ice housing as a human right\nThe team arguing against the resolution Jonathan Cowan and Steven Rattner they identified themselves as progress those but they say the problem is political reality these ideas will scare the public they look great on a bumper sticker but\nIn reality voters will not go for them they cite instance after instance were given the opportunity to either vote for these things they voted against or when put in place they ultimately failed and I want to take a question to Jeff Weaver from something that your opponent said in that Democrats need to have moderates\nCome into the tent and it almost sounded as though they were saying that you and green are arguing for appealing to the Democratic base\nAnd that the moderates you just can't get them I Want to see if I understand that correctly\nThat is not what we're saying we had a hard fought Democratic primary between Secretary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and the evidence was pretty clear I've seen a zillion polls in a zillion states Bernie Sanders was winning rural Democrats conservative Democrats\nIt sounded as though they were saying that you and green or arguing for appealing to the Democratic base and that the moderates you just can't get them I Want to see if I understand that correctly that is not what we're\nSaying they had a hard fought Democratic primary between Secretary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and the evidence is pretty clear I've seen a zillion polls in a zillion states Bernie Sanders was winning rural Democrats conservative Democrats moderate Democrats\nSecretary Clinton was doing much better with suburban Democrats who on paper looked liberal because they are ... pro choice support that and the global warming and so on and so forth\nSo the modeling that was done is clearly showed that Bernie was winning the very voters that you're talking about in red places there were coming out overwhelmingly for Bernie Sanders which is why you want to recall might want to Kansas he wanted to ask anyone in Utah I Want an Idaho and on and on and goes and in fact it is these voters that I'm arguing we need to bring back into the working class voters in red states\nThis question about geographic concentration democratic support is a very very serious problem that we have an electoral college system and we need to broaden our support geographically and the way you do that is by being unapologetically on the side of working people in the states we all forget in\nThe mid west of this country used to be the center of progressive politics in this country the plane was case we have lost touch with those people because the truth of the matter is that there are many people in that wing of the party really don't like those people very much okay just let me\n\nI'm John Donvan this is an energy squared us we have two teams debating this resolution we'll progressive populism saved the Democratic party now it's time for questions from the audience\nA point of fact here it is true that twenty sixteen twenty twelve the voter turnout was around the same however and twenty sixteen it was significantly down among people of color and among working people\nHillary Clinton was a centrist then was or from the wall street wing of the party and her numbers suffered and what you really\nHe's the Democratic party now it's time for questions from the audience\nA point of fact here it is true that twenty sixteen twenty twelve the voter turnout was around the same however and twenty sixteen it was significantly down among people of color and among working people Hillary Clinton was a centrist then was ah from the wall street wing of the party and her numbers suffered\nAnd what you're really saying is had there been a populist maybe Bernie Sanders in right out of Hillary Clinton would we be with President Trump today I think that's your question yes a ticket to see what\nWe saw in twenty sixteen with Hillary Clinton and people of color is that they were not inspired to vote for her the issues weren't there they weren't talking to them another thing that was happening around that time and twenty Fifteen\nWas the black lives matter movement rate the crime bill came up and so there was a lot of feeling from particular young black voters who didn't feel that\nUh the campaign was talking to them we didn't feel that there was a place for them because of what was happening in twenty Fifteen with young black bodies being killed on the streets and we took her point to a\nTo junk out I think you have to disentangle\nProblems with Hillary as a candidate from the question tonight if a candidate in the future carries these ideas\nWill that candidate when whatever you think of the merits of these ideas they're not politically popular enough places just cited the senators who might run for president who support Medicare for all that is true\nThey're all from state loop places our job as a party is not to figure out how to make blue places bluer it's how to make red places blue and purple places blue that's our job [noise] have\nHave not gotten a fair shot and his party in terms of funding other things but what we do know is that your point of view has destroyed the party you're free trade deal\nMedicare for all that is true they're all from state blue places our job as a party is not to figure out how to make blue places bluer it's how to make red places blue and purple places blue that's our job [noise] have\nRestaurants have not gotten a fair shot and his party in terms of funding other things but what we do know is that your point of view has destroyed the party you're free trade deal destroyed the relationship with working class Democrats your call for cutting Social Security is going to kill this party\nYou guys represent a certain group of interest I get it at school like this is a big tent party but you cannot be the dominant voice in his party because you have no credibility with working people when you go out and talk to real world real world\nHave no credibility with working people suggest to be clear because you\nAnd Bernie is that as many times you said block Obama wasn't progressive so widely supported by working class people bronco bomb a building amazing coalition in fact I think our challenge is to rebuild the Obama coalition the centrist Obama coalition just to be clear because that's actually where we have to do\nWhen I don't know what I Would have had you make a point that no one has something to look\nFor Iraq Obama didn't support any of your policies virtually he didn't support Medicare for all hidden support free college tuition\nFor ... years ago were talking about two thousand eat things have changed yes but hinge on it because you\nDon't have All right All right time and I want to throw something into this conversation that comes from an interesting direction the other day there was an op ed attacking Medicare for all it was written by Donald Trump guy\nAnd he said quote the truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead and Joe Biden reacted to that still Trump is should hang on\nSo does Trump's characterization of the party have any traction truck out saying\nThat because his greatest fear is running against someone like Bill Clinton or Obama that's why he thinks he'll lose\nOp ed attacking Medicare for all it was written by Donald Trump go through and he said quote the truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead and Joe Biden reacted to that still Trump issued hung up\nSo does Trump's characterization of the party have any traction drunk I was saying\nThat because his greatest fear is running against someone like Bill Clinton or Obama that's why he thinks he'll lose if Democrats regain the house a third of the Democrats in the house will be self describe new Democrats\nFar from the centrist democratic wing of the party being dead it's alive it's well it's robust it's elected the last two Democrats\nTo the White House and I don't believe the way to win is a reprise of Nineteen nineties democratic centuries them any more than I Believe a reprise of Nineteen sixties democratic socialism the way to win we're in a new era and we need something different or the ideas like Medicare for all put up is there evidence that does win elections for Democrats and there isn't\nGoing to start to respond and I'm gonna go back to question it's not\nJust Medicare for all there is also debt free college there's affordable homeownership or you talked about examples of elections recently where candidates have one um Conor Lamb Pennsylvania Eighteen congressional district\nA very red district I think it had been held by Republican for more than ten years if I if I get that right he was running on protecting Social Security he was running on protecting Medicare and Medicaid\nThe issues matter as well now where do you guys stand on that word is third way stand on Social Security and I think that matters because you're talking about that are issues are not going to win the day but were you guys on Social Security\nI'm protecting Social Security is into Sanders position or progressive populist position it's a position I Can't really think of many Democrats who don't hold\nDoes a woman with a sweater and I think you I'm my name is Kathy\nWhere does third way stand on Social Security I think that matters because you're talking about that are issues are not going to win the day but were you guys on Social Security I'm protecting Social Security is into Sanders position or progressive populist position it's a position I Can't really think of many Democrats who don't hold\nThere's a woman with black swimmer and I think you\nI'm my name is Cathy I'm Wondering you mentioned the new deal and the marginal tax rate in order to pay for that program when from twenty five percent up to Ninety four percent in most other countries that have\nYou know Medicare type for all its Seventy percent how will you get normal working people to be willing to pay Seventy percent increase in taxes in order to pay for others\nYou know there's a recent study out and I got a Medicare for all this also point out that over half of a democratic members of the house of representatives for Medicare for all those postmaster legislations for Medicare for all who's not a fringe idea by the way a there was this report would show that in fact aggregate health care spending in this country would go down substantially if you had a Medicare for all system so will people will be paying more taxes\nYes no doubt about that you can't get around that\nWill they pay less in premiums yes there's one penny premiums they won't be any copayments there'll ... we're going to finally be able to get our hands around the pharmaceutical industry was ripping off this country and charging a size five in the world so in the aggregate our country is going to save money is going to be good for business people will pay less seem rather\n... again this is not a debate about policy debate about politics\nI Do not believe if you go to half of Americans and say you're going to give up your employer based health insurance and come on a government plan they would think that was a great idea but I Want to make a slightly different point because the question was really about taxes Clinton was elected in Nineteen Ninety two why didn't lose the house in Nineteen Ninety four\nBecause Bill Clinton raised taxes and the people did not want that so there is a limit to I'm for tax increases I said that um opening remarks you can raise my taxes\nI Do not believe if you go to half of Americans and say you're going to give up your employer based health insurance and come on a government plan they would think that was a great idea but I Want to make a a slightly different point because of course was really about taxes Clinton was elected in Nineteen Ninety two\nWhy did we lose a house in Nineteen Ninety four because Bill Clinton raised taxes and the people did not want that so there is a limit to I'm for tax increases I said that um opening remarks you can raise my taxes or whatever you want but I think it has been well proven in this country\nThat there's a limit of tolerance for raising taxes beyond a certain point and I don't think it works politically okay I Want to go to some more questions thanks\nHi there my name's Jen I'm I have a question for each side um I mean there's always and party fighting but there seems to be a claim of who is a true Democratic Party and I guess that I like okay\nWhat's your view is representing the Democratic party or type [noise]\nKnow can I answer that are so young when I asked if there is a little [laughter] it was great parties\nThing you're supposed to do is build a winning coalition that does not just include your side or other people the point is if you want to get the White House back\nIn large disdain democratic majorities do good things for the working and middle class in this country you have to build a winning coalition that's the map will they build a winning coalition and when you look at it they don't actually do that\nHave such a problem with that because what we're asking for is inclusive witty what we're saying is if you reach out\nYes white working class in the middle America absolutely matters no one is saying we don't talk to them were saying like hey there are brown people there are black people there are young people that needs to be reached out to it needs to be inclusive\nAnd that's how you build a winning coalition and it needs to be multiracial and so for decades now those folks that I just mentioned ... left out we have we have felt\nAs in the middle America absolutely matters no one is saying we don't talk to them were saying like hey there are brown people there are black people there are young people that needs to be reached out to it needs to be inclusive\nAnd that's how you build a winning coalition and it needs to be multiracial and so for decades now those folks that I just mentioned has some left\nOut we have we have felt left out and now we're at a point in twenty Eighteen when we see candidates across the country in red states and blue states that are representing everyone you have to have inclusive of the you have to include everyone and we can't go back and just focus on one\nGroup can ensure response to that I agree a hundred percent that you have to have a diverse coalition and there's a lot of folks who haven't been represented well unspoken for well the question is what ideas should those diverse group of candidates Terry and will those ideas and able to get a win\nSir my name is Paul so for people who are skeptical about\nToo many government programs and being dependent on\nGovernment health care and government funded education and fearing losing their independence and freedom of choice someone who is more moderate like me who has left the Democratic party become an independent because I don't particularly relate with a lot of these ideas how do you win me back what a great question [noise]\nThat's right on the table for free portion\nOf public colleges and universities we already have\nK. through twelve I think we all support probably going down to pre K I don't know if you guys are in that camp or not so we have an arbitrary deadline where where did you get past twelfth grade now we cut you off we didn't used by the way in New York state in
