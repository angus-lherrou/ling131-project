therefore eminently debatable\nSo let's do it on John's on down here with our live audience a symphony space in New York City for this one we are using the format we call unresolved in which five debaters\nVigorously debate independently they are not on teams they're all flying solo and they're taking on not just one resolution but a whole series of them this series called unresolved us national security please let's meet our debaters first welcome Derek chalet\nYou come back\nTo intelligence squared you are executive vice president of the German Marshall Fund of the United states you had a number of post senior posts in the Obama administration including assistant secretary of defense\nFor international security affairs co editor of a foreign policy blog called shadow government written by members of of a group to describe themselves as the loyal opposition what exactly do we mean by loyal opposition\nWell it's not the deep state uh but it's it's approaching problems wanting of course what's good for the country but doing so not being reflects heavily partisan\nA being brave enough to not pull punches and say when the administration is getting it wrong but also having the courage to say when it's getting it right that's been courage I've had use rarely recently a very important\nSo thanks very much later than that no one's again Derek show lay\nHim

[noise] even refer them to intelligence\nWhere do you ask you a contributing editor at the nation professor emeritus of Russian studies at NYU ends at Princeton author of a lot of books including one that's about to come out\nCalled the war with Russia a dissenting narrative from Newton in Ukraine to Trump and Russia gate you have been really really interested in Russia since your college days where where did that will start\nWhen I was young before most if you were born I was in Birmingham ... finishing a year a study I had left thirty days in three hundred bucks\nI intended because I really have any way to go to Spain and watch the bulls run but I was walking in the working class district to Birmingham and I saw a sign thirty days in the Soviet Union for three hundred dollars [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWelcome back to intelligence squared us I'm John Donvan today we have five panelists debating a series of different resolutions on the theme of us national security before the break we heard opening statements on the first resolution NATO is no longer fit for perjury\nNow back to the debate [noise]\nHave some discussion we have a three nose on this resolution and these nose or actually\nA reverse negative in this case there was no there actually supportive of NATO and we have to yeses which are very skeptical of NATO what I heard this conversation so far has a lot of focus\nOn Russia before that the Soviet Union and the security of Europe but I Want to point out that NATO is also operating in Afghanistan in Kosovo and in the Mediterranean these are these things have nothing to do with Europe this is I don't know if you would call this mission creep or what else what\nCar I Want you to take on that aspect of\nKnow and we have to yeses which are very skeptical of NATO what I heard on this conversation so far with a lot of focus\nOn Russia before that the Soviet Union and the security of Europe but I Want to point out that NATO is also operating in Afghanistan and Kosovo and in the Mediterranean these are these things have nothing to do with Europe that says I don't know if you would call this mission creep or what else\nWhat car I Want you to take on that aspect of NATO's being fit for purpose what is its purpose if it's not a limited to the security of Europe\nSays one thing all of those military operations you named have in common is that it was the United states who dragged our European allies into participating in them\nSo one reason that NATO is set for a purpose because it is the way we organize the most capable countries most willing to help us\nDo what we want to do in the world and I was just to remind people that the only time that NATO's mutual defense pledge was called in was after September eleventh in defense of us\nA John Mearsheimer picked as long as well\nYou just want to make two points one is that when you talk about NATO from a favorable point of view it's all part of the story where the United states has a responsibility to keep peace in virtually every area of the world\nAnd furthermore it's important to have these European allies because they can help us and all these crazy escapades that we engage in where we get our nose bloody delivery\nThe Europeans were really wonderful in helping us destabilize Libya and create all sorts of problems not only in Libya with ... but with regard to refugees inside of Europe furthermore NATO expansion which is all designed just to keep NATO will live\nHas failed miserably or more and now more deeply involved in Eastern Europe than ever when we should be either\nIt'd be the Europeans were really wonderful in helping us destabilize Libya and create all sorts of problems not only in Libya with ... but with regard to refugees inside of Europe furthermore NATO expansion which is all designed just to keep NATO will live\nHas failed miserably or more and now more deeply involved in Eastern Europe than ever when we should be either pivoting to Asia or spending the money here in the United states on the question\nOf the pivot to Asia real well John Mearsheimer were saying we have limited resources and there are more dangerous places that we should be feeling too and paying attention to for example China we can't do both what about that well\nOne I think we can do both we historically have done both whether we choose to bear the burden is a different issue I think you can check the Chinese but it's going to be a risky process we're going to have to stand firm on Taiwan\nFor the says but to the point of NATO you're saying that in no way would you say that the need to deal ... deal with on a cancels\nOut I mean again we're not talking now I have you add all this money off it's comparatively to what we spend on domestic affairs it's peanuts\nSteven calling um royal set in his opening statement that it's tempting fate to pull out of Europe meaning I think what he's saying fate actually is is Russia um take that on\nWhat we've got to do that and we get to the Russia flat and I don't think there's any but I'd like to coral little with what I read in the paper every day that NATO is quote the greatest military alliance in the history of the world you know see that's right\nWell first of all NATO hasn't fought a war is an alliance yet so we're really not sure about that second when NATO does fight wars it's a handful of willing partners with the United states the coalition\nOf the willing but look at the wars John mentioned what do we got Serbia ended up to be a disaster everybody in this room not just those with it\nOh you'll see that's right well first of all NATO hasn't fought a war is an alliance yet so we're really not sure about that Second Life when NATO does fight wars it's a handful of willing partners with the United states the coalition\nOf the willing but look at the wars John mentioned them what are we gone Serbia ended up to be a disaster everybody in this room not just those with liberal illusions would agree Iraq was a disaster where's this greatest military alliance in the world where is the security it's brought\nHaving friends to fight alongside you doesn't I guarantee that you're going to fight the right words are have the right strategy and it means you don't have to do it all by yourself\nAnd so the part of the answer to that China rising is it's going to be a lot easier to manage a rising China\nIf as this now already happening Britain and France are helping us police freedom of navigation the Japanese are helping us do that that that are helping us do that it seems to me like leaders that we would have more wars\nIf you didn't have the NATO alliance to rural Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries out of [noise]\nI'm actually sort of astonished and I'm proud I mean the Europeans have lasted as long as\nThey have in Afghanistan a I have to give him credit I might not have that money that way in two thousand I mean let's\nLet's be Frank I mean the the welfare states and Europe having trouble the militaries in Europe or that they were able actually to come out and deploy forces they did I think it's quite commendable\nI Wish they'd stayed longer I Wish they would spend more money but I Would just repeat a little story that was told to me by the British deputy commander of ice or when I was in Afghanistan one time and I asked them about their barriers European contributions and he said you know the French ... comes to me once\nHaving trouble the militaries in Europe or that they were able actually to come out to deploy the forces they did I think it's quite commendable I Wish they'd stayed longer I Wish they would spend more money but I Would just repeat a little story that was told me by the British\nDeputy commander of ice that when I was in Afghanistan one time and I asked him about the various European contributions and he said you know\nThe French commander comes to me once every two weeks and he says the thing that makes the American and the British commanders hearts just start to ... batter and that is who do you want to keep\nDryer so that is the sign of a good hour by John Mearsheimer [noise] but I I just want to pick up on rose point if the European militaries\nAre feeble militaries these are tiny militaries and the reason they want us to be in Europe to protect them is so that they don't have to pay money for defense and uncles soccer pays the money to protect them\nAnd the idea that the Europeans are going to help us contain China is not a serious argument these countries have no power projection capability if we weren't in Europe protecting them they'd have to spend more money on themselves and we'd be free to pivot to Asia and we'd be free to fix the New York subways [laughter]\n... I'll check that out [laughter] we're\nCertainly in Europe to help protect your but the Europeans are partners as we project our power in the world that we can have a debate of the right or wrong way to protect us power and whether the right decisions have been made but the U.S has never gotten into a fight because the NATO allies have dragged us into that fight when you go to Europe when you go to the Baltics\nWhen you go throughout Western Europe France Germany you you hear this this demand for the United states I mean think of the drama we had over the summer when President Trump went to the NATO summit and talked about whether or not\nAnd I have a debate of the right or wrong way to protect us power and whether the right decisions have been made but the U.S has never gotten into a fight because the NATO allies have dragged us into that fight when you go to Europe when you go to the Baltics\nWhen you go throughout Western Europe France Germany you you hear this this demand for the United states I mean think of the drama we had over the summer when President Trump went to the NATO summit and talked about\nWhether or not the U.S would stay in the alliance and there's panic throughout the European continent they're worried that the United United States is going to go way that us leadership is going to be diminished I think it was a reason for that they're asking for us\nThey want us to be there with them and that's a very very unique position for a country to be in Russia and China do not have those kinds of problems\nAnd this is this an asset for us that we can squander with the wrong decisions and the wrong kind of leadership and that includes\nDiscussion of the resolution [noise]\n\nWe're moving on to our next resolution it deals with Russia yes Russia makes trouble for the U.S are disappearing in elections meddling in the middle east but just how potentially dangerous is Moscow to the U.S really it has nukes\nBut an unimpressive economy it has ... ... but a plethora of domestic problems\nMight we'd be over worrying the Russia factor or are we not worried enough let's find out a resolution for this round the rush of a threat is overblown making the opening statement in regard to this question Steven calling on the resolution the Russian threat is overblown do you declare yes or no\nYeah and you could write a book about it in ... I just\n\n... let me just wrap it up and I don't need Ninety seconds [noise]\nWho's Russia's represents absolutely no\nSteven calling on the resolution the Russian threat is overblown do you declare yes or no\nYeah and you could write a book about it and it's hard 'cause I just huh [laughter]\n...\nLet me just wrap it up and I don't even Ninety seconds [noise]\nBruises Russia's represents absolutely no threat to the United states except those threats we ourselves have provoked\nMainly through NATO ex expansion prudent himself contrary to the newspapers has not been mainly and aggressive leader you would think that's his middle name but a reactive leader Russia Today like it or not\nIs again a very great world power certainly militarily and diplomatically\nHere in lies the tragedy and all this all stop poodles rush\nAnyone's Russia should be America's number one national security partner in the world Washington to squander that opportunity after Nineteen Ninety One and it's continued to squander it today by inventing are provoking threats\n\n[noise]\nForgive me for nightmare five handle is\nDebating several different motions the theme is unresolved us national security or reminder of where we are we're halfway through this intelligence squared us debate or five panels were debating the state and the future of American national security\nAnd now you Ron I'm always high on the list of us security concerns and aspiring a nuclear power the backer of terrorism with the perpetual question isolate Iran squeeze it or try to\nNational security or reminder of where we are we're halfway through this intelligence squared us debate are five panels are debating the state and the future of American national security\nAnd now Iran I'm always high on the list of us security concerns and aspiring a nuclear power\nThe backer of terrorism with the perpetual question isolate Iran squeeze it or tried to coax this radical nation and to more moderate behavior\nIt's the choice it's at the heart of our final resolution it is time to take a hard line on Iran Derek chalet on that resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran you declare yes or no\nI mean yes but I Am a yes but you know explain Iran provides material and political support to those who are trying to destabilize the middle east around forces have been responsible for the deaths of thousands in places like Syria runs proxies had killed American civilians and our troops\nAnd Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons\nSo of course it's time to take a hard line against or on a that begins by forging the strongest possible international consensus Iran must know that its actions have consequences whether in form of economic pressure political isolation or even military response\nIn other words the best way to take a hard line is to present a United front\nAnd that's what the Iran nuclear deal did\nThe Iran nuclear deal did not solve all of our problems in with her on but it did put the brakes the number is urging serious ones so taking a hard line needs to be more than a slogan needs to be a means to an end it's not just about talking tough than beating your chest it's about pursuing smart policies that you get you closer to your goals they could actually\n[noise] the resolution of scientific\nHard line on Iran Steven Cohen on this resolution to declare yes or no actually

talking tough and beating your chest it's about pursuing smart policies that you get you closer to your goals they could actually\n[noise] the resolution of scientific\nA hard line on Iran Steven Cohen on this resolution to declare yes or no\nAnd I said no you know Derrick I I mean I I I kind of giving the credit that he's made it leads to semi persuasive case I mean I don't think it's all the charge like some of the things that have been set about Russia\nI'll take I'll take no for sure for sure but my feeling is is that the United states or Trump as we like to call the United states today\nHaving left the nuclear agreement and reimpose sanctions\nI asked myself what would a harder line result it's likely to create instability inside Iran\nThat is likely to spread to Iraq and Syria and elsewhere in the middle east and I don't see that is good for anybody\nSecondly it certainly would at least theoretically risk war depending on how hard this hard line is and that could involve the United states Israel and possibly Russia it will then increase Russia's military and energy producing role in the world because\nThey've been going on sorry under time is up thank you very much\n[noise]\nGoing out to Korea shockey on the resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran please tell us how you declare\nIs time to take a harder line on Iran they are that top state sponsor of terrorism in the world they're arming Hezbollah and Hamas they are keeping bus Bashar al Assad in power at and they are occasionally interdict thing shipping\nGoing out to Korea shockey on the resolution it's time to take a hard line on Iran please tell us how you declare\nIt is time to take a harder line on Iran they are the top state sponsor of terrorism in the world they're arming Hezbollah and Hamas they are keeping bus Bashar al Assad in power\nAnd they are occasionally interdict in shipping and the straits of Hormuz through which an enormous amount of the world's oil transits\nUh so so yes we should take a harder line both\nThe Trump Administration and the Obama administration had an unbelievable policy namely either you stop your nuclear weapons program or we will destroy it and\nI don't think that's credible out if either of the two governments we need a wider range of tools to manage the Iran problem at this at its core the Iran problem is that\nThe domestic legitimacy and the foreign policy of Iran and have the same route which is they view that themselves as a revolutionary power\nSo taking a soft line on Iran doesn't result in Iran stopping doing these things\nThat could very shocking [noise] could take a hard line on Iran John Mearsheimer do declare yes or no I say no I take this resolution is a question uh dealing with President Trump's decision in\nOf this year to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran and uh I think that that was a fundamental mistake but the question is [noise]\nPushing you want to ask yourself is one of the country's ... nuclear weapons they want nuclear weapons because they understand they are the ultimate deterrent and if you're threatened you really want to have nuclear weapons why does Israel has nuclear weapons because it's leaders think they live in a dangerous neighborhood where they\nClear agreement with Iran and uh I think that that was a fundamental mistake of the question is [noise]\nPushing you want to ask yourself is what countries want nuclear weapons they want nuclear weapons because they understand they are the ultimate deterrent and if you're threatened you really want to have nuclear weapons why does Israel has nuclear weapons because it's leaders think they live in a dangerous neighborhood where they want to have the ultimate deterrent and they're back pocket\nWell what's good for the goose is good for the gander so there's going to be a very powerful incentive for the Iranians to think the same way\nNow Beau hawks believed that you can get really tough with the Iranians and you can beat them in to give up nuclear weapons for ever I don't think that's going to happen\nFirst of all it's just going to reinforce the hard liners inside of Iran and second of all nationalism is a very powerful force and the idea that you could push the Iranians around I think is a misguided thought\nThank you [noise] have time\nTo take a hard line on Iran last in the lineup of panelists to declare yes or no royal marker act are you a yes or no yes\nUh I say I mean this was one of those issues that I think the Trump Administration was actually on the right thing I have to commend it at a stop the surreal situation where the United states was\nFeeding tens of billions of dollars and to the Islamic republic into itchy eyes imperialism throughout the region for a short\nRest said for the production of centrifuges it\nMakes no strategic or moral sense\nWhy we would want to give money to a regime that is gauge the mass slaughter in Syria why we would want to give money to a stage that is building his laws throughout the Shiite regions of the middle east I just think this is not particularly since the Jaycee was such a very very bad deal it's as ...\nProduction of centrifuges it makes no strategic or moral sense\nWhy we would want to give money to a regime that is gauge the mass slaughter in Syria\nWhy we would want to give money to a stage that is building his laws throughout the Shiite regions of the middle east I just think this is not particularly since the Jaycee be away was such a very very bad deal it's as leaky it's got his many holes in Swiss cheese in it I Would also add\nThe demonstrations that have been going on in Iran since December ought to tell you they're not shouting out down with America Donald Donald Trump they're showing down with the regime down with the revolutionary guard\nMarker foods opening statement with the resolution it's\nTime to take a hard line on Iran looking at\nThe opening round we have three sisters and two knows I Want to go to Corey shockey with some points made by people on the no side which seem to all come down to the question of dangerous unintended consequences of taking a harder line on Iran and the one hand Steven Cohen saying you would risk war dangerous unintended consequences what about that\nYes I think they're dangerous unintended consequences for confronting Iran destabilizing and dangerous behavior but they're also dangerous unintended consequences of not confronting\nAllowing Iran to continue to destabilize regional governments to interject that free commerce through the streets of farm is\nTo continue to be a state sponsor of terror recall that the Iranian government tried to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington DC\nSo not confronting saying bad restaurant yeah I Know also has the potential to encourage incentivize\nContinued Iranian malign behavior they're actually well look this is\nTo continue to be a state sponsor of terror recall that the Iranian government tried to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington DC\nSo not confronting saying bad restaurant yeah also also has the potential to encourage an incentive eyes\nContinued Iranian malign behavior\nThey're actually well look this is the land of no good options right when I was at the Pentagon during the negotiations of the Iran nuclear deal I had nothing to do with the negotiations uh with the Pentagon's role in this was what do we do when the negotiations earth negotiations fail and all we're left with is the military option\nNow we have ... yeah US military has has has shown over the years that they can do all sorts of things overthrow governments put a lot of a fire power in particular targets but those those are not particularly palatable option so I Would argue we were in a better position where we had isolated the nuclear problem\nRose right temporarily ten to Fifteen Years so we could work on the other aspects of Iran's behavior that posts such a threat to the United states the problem now that we pulled out of the the nuclear deal when you go to Europe when you go to the middle east what they're talking about\nIs American policy not Iran's policy and I don't believe that Iran has actually benefited that much from the uh the nuclear deal I mean you're on and people were on the streets and they actually thought the nuclear deal was a bad deal for them\nSo the idea that now we're going to engage in some sort of negotiation to get a better deal from from our perspective we're still for Iran to me is fantasy John ...\nFrom our perspective we're still for Iran to me is fantasy genre shy yeah I I Want to respond to a point that Korea made and tied that into a point", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Documentary
