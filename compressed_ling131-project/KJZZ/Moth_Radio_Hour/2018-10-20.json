punishment which was that we for the rest of vacation had to stay on the beach because we did not have any respect for the water so it's a hundred degrees out and after about a half hour of whining\nAnd fighting and like emptying out all the copper tone and kicking sand we break my pets last nerve and she said All right you can go in the water but only after your knees so we're happy for a minute until we get in the water and realize how boring up to your\nIs and then we get the great plan of having chicken fights so we started to have chicken fights but it's kind of weird because there was only three of us so\nWhat we're doing the best we can have a chicken fight like that and like knock each other off into the water so we get fully immersed and then my uncle out who never ever played with us ever\nComes into the water to play chicken fights with us and he puts his daughter and my cousin Eileen up on his shoulders and then I get up on my cousin Kevin shoulders and we're having chicken fights and it's like actual family fun for a moment\nScared because there's only three of us so\nWhat we're doing the best we can to have a chicken fight like that and like knock each

Cape\nAnd it's awful and everybody's just crying and pointing at me and now my other aunts or getting in on it like in who's to blame part of the conversations happening so I just kind of back off into the water\nI'm kind of like going back and like regrets thing back to like where life as I once knew it had ended and they just stand there and like I kind of wish I had drowned\nAnd I kinda wish the Kennedys hadn't saved me and I've been told in into the waves and I just I just er like sifting through sand and shells and ... and it's totally ridiculous but like I Will never stop looking for this I I'm going to look forever and I keep looking and looking at um sifting through and then all of a sudden there was an eyeball it my palm\nFake staring right at me and so I met I drop it back [noise] and it stinks back into the water\nNow we know it is possible so everybody gets back into the water and now we're all sifting through and sifting through and I pray to God for no more future
