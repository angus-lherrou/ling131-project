remember the hour long episode she did recording it for months and he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet of hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made us choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women
