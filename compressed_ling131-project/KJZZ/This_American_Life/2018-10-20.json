so much\nFrom W easy Chicago this is the pledge drive edition of this American Life Ira Glass and one thing I'm a kind of love about these ... shows is that I can pick anything at all from our over Twenty years of shows to play for you\nAnd I had fun actually looking through a we had this a page on our website where the producers of our show just a list and then regular blurbs about their favorite stories that we've ever done which by the way if you haven't seen this and you're looking for something to listen to and your commute or whatever I totally recommend that any way\nUsing that I have lined up a bunch of stories today that have not been on the air and forever and there are really special\nUh starting with this one this is from Sarah ... who's now the host of our show cereal the stressors broadcast in two thousand nine and it's about a fight\nOver who gets credit for certain ideas\nSo wrote the story about her dad Julian\nAll my life I've heard the hallmarks of my father's achievements are invented some rice or that was in Nineteen thirty six when he was a counselor at camp gridlock for boys they already had arm wrestling for the boys and leg wrestling\n... rigid another rush for our I invented some rush or were the same rules as a hockey puck fresh off on\nThe hallmarks of my father's achievements\nI invented some wrestling\nThat was in Nineteen thirty six when he was a counselor at camp gridlock for boys they already had arm wrestling for the boys and leg wrestling\nBut we did another wrestling when I graduated from Russia or where the same rules as a hockey puck face off one two three go\nJust came to you like just a stroke oh we should use their thumbs\nReserved for her it was ... devastated moment [noise]\nThe discoveries kept coming shrimp for instance I was popularized shrimp spring America in Nineteen forty\nOne and my father shrimp lover was discouraged that there were only two places on Broadway in New York where you could get shrimp [noise] so then in Biloxi, Mississippi in there with me here because the story barely makes any sense\nSo he's in Biloxi on his way to Mexico with somebody and he sees his government boat about to go out to track the migratory path of shrimp and he talks his way onto the boat by explaining that he loves tramped apparently\nAnd he goes out on this boat and they find the shrimp breeding grounds or some such the rest of course this history\nThen practice in New York our patrols Broadway or nine zero\nShrimp shrimp [noise] more [noise] and this way tortured by popularized shrimp her question about it [noise]\n[noise] really really fit evidence that you ... [laughter] I'm not married you're going to be [noise]\nPlenty mom industry\nMy dad does make a claim on the word character that he came up with the idea to use it to mean a person is unusual or

industry\nMy dad does make a claim on the word character that he came up with the idea to use it to me and a person of unusual or eccentric qualities\nYou have a character in a play of course but it was a very common usage as he's a character\nAnd what made you do you remember why you started using it\nFires just shifted a doctor for Goldman barrel or ... or ... for our procedures\nAccording to my father Norman Mailer also said he invented some wrestling mailer who died in two thousand seven was a famous wrestler but not its inventor because as we now know my dad invented it at camp gridlock for boys\nAnd that's the rub you can't prove the origin of any of this stuff and it's annoying when people like Norman Mailer take credit my dad would like people to recognize him for his contributions to shrimp and character in some wrestling but he's not going to make a stink if they doubt\nHis real legacy though in advertising that's another story that he's willing to fight for and he has been fighting for it for decades\nMy father was a legendary copywriter\nYou wrote time Macs takes it looking and keeps on ... he named Earth Day Earth Day it falls on his birthday April twenty second birthday birthday so the idea came easily\nMagazine Advertising Age made a list of the top one hundred advertising campaigns of the twentieth century the Marlborough man is on it and they Energizer Bunny good to the last drop from Maxwell House and the keep America beautiful crying Indian but the number one at the top of the one hundred list things small [noise] that was Volkswagen's American\nCampaign to sell the beetle in Nineteen fifty nine and my father wrote in the picture of a tiny car on a big white page\nSeen Advertising Age made a list of the top one hundred advertising campaigns of the twentieth century the Marlborough man is on it and they Energizer Bunny good to the last drop from Maxwell House and the keep America beautiful crying Indian but the number one at the top of the one hundred list I think the small [noise] that was Volkswagen's American\nCampaign to sell the beetle in Nineteen fifty nine and my father wrote in the picture of a tiny car on a big white page\nAnd send them use self deprecating copy that had was followed by lemon another VW ad so iconic and made it onto the TV show Mad Men the show set in Nineteen sixty about an ad agency that slightly behind the times in this scene the agency's creative team contemplates the lemon ad\nOr one of the most of the car did one last year saying smoked for over six small pager full page you could really see the pro you're\nAt the time these ads were revolutionary in the beginning there was a Volkswagen another famous New York ad men wrote that was the day when the new advertising agency was really bored there's another scene for Mad Men when Don Draper the agency's creative director interview some new talent after he looks at their portfolio he hands it back to that with this one\nLooks good to find a way of showing on extroverts however\nIt's Julian ... actually my father and what is irritated him for so long it's not that he's not recognized for talent I mean the people who write madman clearly no who is it to some of his best work has been claimed by someone else\nInsurance the greatest predictor of my work was by one charm partner George Wallace was most arrows\nAnd challenger and our director drawing on his tolerances owner shooter by ... ... you go [noise]\nSo we're once for it or burn\nIt's the greatest predator of my work was by one time partner George Wallace was most arrows religion\nAnd challenger ... our director just drawing on his tolerances owners shooter by his ... ... you go [noise]\nSo we're once for it or burn\nExcept judge what's the word would be we did it regardless of who originated your word for word redo\nEvaporated from Georgia originally carrier became right\nIf you've heard of anyone in the advertising industry it might be George Lois he's well known for a lot of things but maybe especially for its provocative and funny Esquire Magazine covers from the Nineteen sixties like the one of my Hamad Ali posing in Saint Sebastian but before that George Lewis worked at building burned back instead of my father\nIn Nineteen sixty they both left Haiti and joined up with another guy Fred peppered\nTo form their own upstart agency called TK out peppered Kennedy Lois\n... wouldn't talk to me for this story I'm not going to get into a sophomore\nFight with a disgruntled ex partner he wrote an an email I Can't say blaming had mixed feelings about this fight of course I Want to stick up for my father take his side\nBut I've also thought there's something inherently undignified about the whole thing like it's beneath my father to care whether or not George Lewis is taking credit for this or that slogan from Nineteen sixty two\nSo I never really paid attention to the details until now lately it's been coming up more or at least more publicly so I started asking questions\nAccording to my father it all started with the Harvey probe or account Harvey probably made elegant modern furniture my dad says he came up with the ad a beautiful chair with a match book under one leg and a line if you're Harvey proper chair wobbles straightened\nSlogans from Nineteen sixty two so I never really paid attention to the details until now lately it's been coming up more or at least more publicly so I started asking questions according to my father it all started with the Harvey ... account\nHow are we probably made elegant modern furniture my dad says he came up with the ad a beautiful chair with a match book under one leg in a line if you're Harvey proper chair wobbles straighten your floor and if he's a copy that went with it that he thought was very good\nI assume if I had a different personality I Would say I know what I'd done and uh those deer in near to me you know why I have done or not done and murdered and tell us that but I'm a a\nFallible fallible fellow and uh obviously would be ego of his own and I resent\nSay I know what I've done and a noisy area near to me you know why I Am John John\n... is our Maria tolerable fallible from them and uh obviously would be over his own and I resent\nBeing bird of\n...\nThe odd thing about all this was my older brother John points out isn't my father's never exactly been a champion of advertising\nAnd he never believed he didn't have a true believer in the business I mean I remember him saying to me as a kid [laughter] uh you know if you don't find something you want to do and really work at it you're going to end up like me a writer of short sentences\nThat's forbidden him\nAnd so [laughter] it's so it's a little ironic you know because he didn't he didn't care that things here you know all those years he didn't care because I think he thought it was beneath them and the business in some ways not and was not need them but was\nNot serious enough to care that much about and now he does\nI understand why he cares he's eighty eight years old now so his legacy understandably is on his mind even though he did campaigns for all sorts of good causes gun control\nNuclear proliferation Robert Kennedy's senatorial in presidential campaigns my father's not quite satisfied with his life's work in advertising is\nA is built on a puffer a on at heart destruction and I don't think anybody can do proud Williams in the next world\nNuclear proliferation Robert Kennedy's senatorial in presidential campaigns my father's not quite satisfied with his life's work in\nAdvertising is a is broke drawn a\nPop for a a at heart destruction and I don't figure anybody can do proudly until the next world will be for real bills on deception even though\nNo matter how well they do [noise]\nYou're not necessarily proud that you had a career in the field of advertising and then and that's your legacy but you are proud that you were the best in the business at the thing you chose to do\nOr sugar show to better myself [noise]\nMm Mm Mm [noise]\nIf you could go back she's another career my father would have liked to have been an environmentalist of some kind\nWhich is why he'd really like to be remembered for something almost nobody knows he dead naming Earth Day it agitated him to look up Earth Day on Wikipedia recently and not see his name anywhere so few days ago added it\nUm [noise]\nChicken in the years since we first broadcast that story 'cause Julian died she was Ninety three is of course there is the host of Syria which if you have not heard just launched its third season which she spends a year in one court house in fines and credible and revealing stories that have so much about the criminal justice system that is not what we're here to talk about though\nThis is the pledge drive and this kind of story\nAbout Syria's dad I just liked it a story like that can exist in the world that that person or an emotional and also about the great things like what it is to look back on your life and what you would have done I just I just like it it just gets to me and and we put\nIncredible and revealing

forty four dollars an hour\nFor sure it is safe turn on the program back on the go ahead started meeting the refugees again with the more extreme vetting that you want it and then on about day a hundred and ten of the hundred and twenty days they hear back from the White House\nThe White House did not like the conclusion at this review and according to Barbara and the others I spoke to in the group the White House wanted it to change\nThat express concern about the recommendation to resume refugee processing of all nationalities and do you know which nationalities the White House was worried about\nTrying to say this record is probably not\nI was told that there was a particular concern about I'm slowly nationals\nThe administration specifically pointed to Somalis as the sticking point\nWhy I don't know what do you think\nI honestly can't speculate you don't want to start you know I honestly I to this day I don't know\nAnd there's no rationale the you were given like because Somalia is like this\nFor like\nThe rationale wasn't shared with me\nGovernment officials confirm this for me Somalia wasn't the only concern they said but it was a major concern is chief of staff John Kelly in particular was unhappy they said I think it was one guy in the group told me at the end of the day the data\nUnlike because Somalia is like this for like\nThe rationale wasn't shared with me\nTo government officials confirmed this for me Somalia wasn't the only concern they said but it was a major concern was chief of staff John Kelly in particular who was unhappy they said I think it was\nOne guy in the group told me at the end of the day the data didn't show that Somalis were any special risk\nSo after a hundred and twenty days the White House reopen the refugee program for some countries but not for a handful of countries who make up a lot of the refugees that are resettled here\nFor Somalia intent others including all the countries in the original travel ban the refugee program would stay suspended for them the hundred and twenty day review got another Ninety Days\nMy boss asked me to think about options for how to address the White House's concerns\nOver says she and the other members of a group or sort of at a loss for what else they could possibly review but they went back to work they came up with some more recommendations\nAfter Ninety Days in January twenty teen the White House did we start the whole refugee program\nBut it was like turning on a faucet and nothing coming out if you look at Somalia and it was ten other countries this fiscal year it looks like we will admit three percent of who we allow just a year before last year we admitted more than six thousand Somalis\nThis year just two hundred and fifty extreme vetting has gotten so extreme seems that people can actually get through it barber says the changes they recommended shouldn't have had this effect it shouldn't have slowed things down so much others I spoke to from the groups at the same thing\n[noise] it's not clear whether the numbers are so low but Barbara and the other people I talked to said the White House just never supplied the staffing and the resources to carry out the new vetting\nThe extreme vetting has gotten so extreme it seems that people can actually get through it barber says the changes they recommended shouldn't have had this effect it shouldn't have slowed things down so much others I spoke to from the groups at the same thing\nIt's not clear why the numbers are so low but Barbara and the other people I talked to said the White House just never supplied the staffing and the resources to carry out the new vetting a few people told me that the FBI in particular isn't staffed up enough to do the checks it's supposed to do\nAs a result there is not a ban and police on these refugees but the outcome is nearly the same deja spokesperson said the new screen procedures are undoubtedly making America safer they point to one specific example in Iraqi wanted for murder in Iraq who entered the United states through our refugee program and twenty four team\nThey said today with the new vetting procedures he would not have made it through [noise]\nThere is some risk with every immigration program if you wanted to zero risk immigration system you wouldn't have any immigration at all\nYou know my sense is that the uh the
