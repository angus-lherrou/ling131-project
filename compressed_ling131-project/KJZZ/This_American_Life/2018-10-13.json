degrees at two o'clock\nIn the school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training the running to first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district in rural Ohio that let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team this year was a pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations over the school [noise] I saw the ride a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and they get to where the shooter as as soon as possible\nAnd they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThough did fire during these drills so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe enough you have to put your finger on the sensor is like a hundred something\nAnd it's a little tricky\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shooter [noise]\nTo put your finger on the sensor is I don't mean to put\nAnd a little tricky\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shooter [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's the principal for grade six to twelve and he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria so he's got a gun he's wearing a bulletproof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused very aware of the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one\nOf these shootings another kid can be killed not enough of this way [noise]\n\nElementary awareness in the elementary when [noise]\nFeel I'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's locked this happens automatically when the school doesn't to lock down\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nGo driving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n[noise] oh here we go to [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there\nSo that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just timing the response\nWasn't great\nWasn't the parties appear to first yeah oh yeah it was it was to go to the doors\n[noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise]\nSo that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWasn't great\nThat wasn't the attorney compared the first yeah oh yeah it was the guy or the doors\nAt all I\nSaid so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nBut I I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the\nRight thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle it down\nAnd which is different you know first time you should be done that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nI said that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this as a shooter\nIn your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss there's a possibility of somebody else getting her [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts us doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that's who the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed it [noise] but these\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare for like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it looks a pass to display the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can\nAdministrators and others look at previous shootings and pass it would just be the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago it's this American Life America ...\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nLike one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning and the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than workday I mean they knew what to do\nEven still even with that we still had\nCatch what I'm going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well they did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for every this is what a ... black is this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were apps and a silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nMelissa says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nTold every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in their classroom doors with paper\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were apps and a silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nMelissa says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in their classroom doors with paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nYou know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise]\nLike the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop she shouts\nThere there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWell to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter]\n\nHer classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway\nAnd say to hell with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter]\n\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nShe kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group a small enough to fitness applied closet someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight\nAnd she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except didn't faces led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Ferris says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on and when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still\nIn the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was I kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that in training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they have their weapons\nDrawn she really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle pushed it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n...\nOnce told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls that closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grazed she survived Scott Beagle and the room next to Stacy used at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in his doorway that there's very little evidence about whether school shooting\nThe moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway Stacy is the teacher who's our most grazed she survived Scott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway that\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives in mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what the effective in these drills at Xavier University\nAnd it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew they done at Douglas like paper over windows\nCheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on it\nInternational has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like tapering over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much\nIt's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ...\nAll the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes at all I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat bad means that the shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked ... [noise] but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually curse how sheets dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student [noise] remember it was a break from her school's\nProtocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem

that situation at work with the gun me being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door\nBut most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did just actually had\nDone it and she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull those kids in her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional locked down at her school sweating hide\nBut when I asked her what the drill is four she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one a classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids\nWe don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricade ing\nRichard who told me we should not do drills at school\nPeriod to traumatizing for kids\nWho don't pretend to crash

barricaded him\nAnd I want to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because it's a thing to reckon with [noise]\nI wanted to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school Charles point about don't say codes call it like it is\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom into my daughter code red\nChance breeze taken nice\nPress he can nice the rats [laughter]\nJust brief taken nice the press he can nice the rat [noise]\nOkay okay [laughter]\nBreeze with me [laughter] [noise]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's got his breath enough to talk\nHe tells Sandy he wants to shootings to stop you wants to take action somehow and then Chad's suddenly switches gears and starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know the evidence is going on in this world if we can go the way is not going to change their lives because stress for your drug stores are still able to do and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year develop those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government staged mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips is ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing there\nTo

saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shoving match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to Joan through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh mhm mhm mhm [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse\nThe setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting

new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse friend called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming just\n[noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting site what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trashed\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and took the no never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nAnd then five months later there was another mass

and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they\nFelt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces and he said that's what we looked like five months ago\nThat looked like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying to show their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back\nSandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the Philips has said there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech\nIn Tucson these parents lost kids suddenly and violently\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back\nSandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying

parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moments that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal light mon brothers should they should you know Seamus you were should you know let me explain something you're right I'm not the same person I never will be they see it as we're obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople who were closest to disappear which makes this informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son and the shooting at Parkland Monica in that store at and let them at their house their son's name was Nick he was\nPeople who were closest to disappear which makes this informal support groups even more crucial\nWould that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise]\nI got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland on a kitten that store at I met them at their house their son's name was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis on his win scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nWhich said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less\nAnd watch Scarface together the day of the shooting mentioned ... phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard neck was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who mash next\nDescription but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is out in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nFor the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you give any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nI'm at two o'clock in the morning you see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a
