I might call you this a real fan of economics yes would you say that's accurate or now\nYeah I mean you know on a typical friday night um if it's going well and open up um like a economics textbook and [laughter] you know a more seriously yeah I'm a huge fan of economics I studied in grad school\nI remember when the two of us we're at the American economics association annual meetings in Boston you looked like a you looked like my daughter to one direction [laughter] you are who are into it yeah I was very into it [noise]\n\nAll right so in your studies having studied econ and public policy at the Woodrow Wilson school at Princeton correct yeah that's right [noise]\nSo in your studies of economic ... you have surely come across the character [noise] it's kind of a model for how economists are economics predicts that humans behave who's known as homo economic us yes do you remember reading learning about him\nAbsolutely I mean if you've ever taken an economics class or read an article from huge cross section of academic papers it's sort of hard not to encounter this creature I mean academics might not always referred to him by name but implicitly their models usually assume that the people there are modeling\nOur hyper irrational and always work to make themselves as best off as possible and would you say\nEconomic us yes do you remember reading learning about him\nAbsolutely I mean if you've ever taken an economics class or read an article from huge cross section of academic papers it's sort of hard not to encounter this creature I mean academics might not always referred to him by name but implicitly their models usually assume that the people there modeling\nOur hyper rational and always work to make themselves as best off as possible\nAnd would you say that what you just described the kind of hyper rational and working to maximize their optimize your choices and your decisions does that describe you as a human\nWe ... no I don't think so actually what would you like it too I mean I think so I mean like most people I think that you know my brain is\nUm has various biopsies and jurists sticks and emotions that sort of cloud optimal decision making and I think I Would personally be better off if I behave that way but I'm not sure that society would be better off [laughter]\nUm well All right why do we do this and what's going to try let's undertake mission which is to make you Greg resolves the more you know better off if you put up by becoming more like homo economic is try to live your life a little bit more the way that\nEconomists would describe the way someone should live their lives are you for that kind of mission definitely it sounds like an adventure [noise]\nNow um [noise] you are very bright guy I Know but still it would be nice don't you think to have some kind of personal tutor like Virgil to walk you down into the depths some kind of economics therapist maybe to walk you through these decisions you like that idea now you want to go on your own\nYeah for sure I mean given many academics think that nobody behave this way I think it would be really helpful to have some sort of advisor\nAre very bright guy I Know but still it would be nice to have some kind of personal tutor like a virtual to walk you down into the depths some kind of economics therapist maybe to walk you through these decisions you liked that idea now you want to go on your own\nYeah for sure I mean given many academics think that nobody behave this way I think it would be really helpful to have some sort of advisor or yeah you could call him a a therapist\nSo does any particular Cano therapist or come to mind um\nUm are you thinking of who I'm thinking of I think you know there's a good ... hang on hang on on kind of three we'll see if you're thinking when I'm writing one\nTwo three Baylor Baylor [noise]\nSailor is Richard Thaler I'm a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Chicago\nBooth School of business but he's more than that sailors a recent Nobel laureate\nIs one of the founders of the field is coming to be known as behavioral economics which to be very shorthand the about it runs humble economic gets through a few layers of psychological understanding to see how real people actually\nBehave sailors been doing this work for many years but his public breakthrough came a few years ago\nWhen he co authored a book with the legal scholar casts unseen we ended up calling our book and the tools we used to not just in sailors view if you want to get people to do more of what they should be doing\nSaved more money for retirement or eat more nutritious food or break some bad habits [noise] sometimes you have to nudge them into doing something because most of us don't necessarily respond to incentives as rationally as economic theory would predict\nWe ended up calling our book and the tools we use can nudge us\nSailors view if you want to get people to do more of what they should be doing saved more money for retirement or eat more nutritious food or break some bad habits [noise] sometimes you have to nudge them into doing so because most of us don't necessarily respond to incentives as rationally\nAs economic theory would predict because most of us from the economists perspective\nMisbehave which is the\nTheme of Taylor his most recent book so the book is called misbehaving\nThe making of behavioral economics\nMisbehaving stale air is very entertaining chronicle of how he came to recognize that the standard economists model of human behavior is beyond the reach of most of us\nOf the economic model of behavior really can be summarized by one word which is optimizing\nAnd at the center of this model is the creature that our producer Greg results he hopes to become\nThis mythical creatures called homo economic us\nAnd I called them econ ... for short and that you know none of us know and he comes\nAn income can make any calculation perfectly accurately\nAs no self control problems makes accurate forecast these not overconfident\n[noise] as no emotions [noise]\nSo can we take Greg a perfectly nice and intelligent thirty year old man and under the two ... Richard Thaler turned him into an\nAnd even if we can would that be a good idea\nSending them out into the world interacting with all sorts of people and let me warn you\nFired from work [noise] go away [laughter]\nSo can we take Greg a perfectly nice and intelligent thirty year old man and under the Tudor Richard Thaler turned him into an\nAnd even if we can would that be a good idea\nSending them out into the world interacting with all sorts of people and let me warn you\nIsn't always going to be pretty\nFire it came from work [noise] go away [laughter] I Know it's your time some random charity that will trigger my like free freeloaders\nFifty cents an hour\nI'd like to get\n\nGuess freakonomics radio show in at a lower ... inside of everything [noise] here's your house even [noise]\nToday I'm turning the Mike over to Greg was asking producing freakonomics radio who is teaming up with the economist Richard stale or to try living as homo economic as a supremely rational being\nAs a long time practitioner a behavioral economics sailor has kind of experience that could make him a good advisor in\nIt might cost to become more economic as the model of human behavior still taught in economics or no one there may be no better advisor then Richard Thaler\nIs actually been described by a colleague as the world's only clinical economist that's sort of like being a therapist except uses principles from economics to improve people's lives he's almost casually for his friends over the years and it's sort of what he's evolved to do professionally\nKnow you can think of no just the culmination\nModel of human behavior still taught in economics or no one there may be no better advisor then Richard Thaler\nHe's actually been described by a colleague as the world's only clinical economists that's sort of like being a therapist except uses principles from economics to improve people's lives these on this casually for his friends over the years and it's sort of what he's evolved to do professionally [noise]\nYou know you can think of no just the culmination of my career as a clinical economist because what Cass I tried to do in that book is help people think about\nOrganizing their lives in a more successful way and helping governments and the private sector created institutions that allow people to achieve their goals more helpful a\nNudge at a huge influence in public policy circles Casson Steen ended up directing regulatory policy for President Obama will stay alert vice a bunch of governments including Britain which set up an office nickname the nuts unit that off his meds citizens to do things I quit smoking find jobs pay their taxes on time and conserve energy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "21"}
