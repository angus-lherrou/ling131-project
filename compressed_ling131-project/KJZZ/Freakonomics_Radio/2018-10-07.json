from our historical penchant for war colonizing two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\n\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise San

an athlete's time to step back and try to understand how\nThese people rose to such heightened\nHow scientific is the process how predictable will look at a number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both superstar athletes will look at will determination I did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was throwing up and the mental aspect\nOf this most physical pursuit to\nWell I think the mind is is as big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools\nWill hear stories of opportunities gained\nAnd lost in Nineteen eighty one it was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand eight teams seven point eight percent and we'll hear one story it's almost too good to be true\nThey

an elite performer in any field sports store music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question is how they get so that how much of that ability where they born\nHow much is attributable to hard work and practice this is a debate been going on probably forever nature versus nurture\nRaw talent versus what's called deliberate practice we've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become great at just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious ... great at anything\nYou need both talent in ... lots of each but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because\nAthletic success like any success and leave money failure it's what you might call multi factorial\nA lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also end up identical\nAs much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced and then also more interesting so I mean\nJay Z\nWith identical talent levels in identical training methods you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also end up identical\nAs much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced than that also for interesting so I mean [noise]\nJay Z sold\nDrugs grew up in a Marcy projects to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL\nNow he is a multi multi millionaire married to beyond say the most amazing talent we have\nToday so why don't we set it up so that all\nYoung men must sell drugs when their kids and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York I mean\nHe had a great talent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like\nHe happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me see and I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should\nBe that should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprised to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high base\nLiars but trying to build around it seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance three time major league baseball all star\nYes you are and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete are going to be the best get on your teams\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more um I played backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits\nPassed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about a hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals in ...\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar athletes they both come from very athletic families\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shift friend who was one two and then put gold medals\nMom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and next surgeries and\nLiterally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar athletes they both come from very athletic families\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shifting who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is ... extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgeries and hands surgeries and neck surgeries and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up and the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson he was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he a race ... 'cause I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas\nDonald a is about six to um lean a\nIn your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athletes but rather to get into and Lee University like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that Steve limit my freakonomics friends and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nMy calculation about point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave a fencing the the only exception be my own university University of Chicago in each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says eBay this\nTo be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten have a fencing think the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nAnd each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill there's three different blade says ... soil and there's male female fancy and given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers so it's something\nLike six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors ended up being college Spencer so I'm not saying they get scholarships but that\nThey're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing how much does limit think fencing increases your chances from that point four percent baseline\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else constant something like Fifteen fold we should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools\nThat said as an admission sweetener\nHow does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nGod if you want to go to the ivy league school forget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like\nThree hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing\nTurns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned into sensors love it\nI just actually won and us so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a ... ah he he strangely enough\nAnd presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned to defense or is it\nExactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old\nAnd he fences at a really good club in Chicago and I don't know his grades aren't that good so he knows and I know as everybody else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played\nAt Kentucky or do you view would have been and talk to him and drive the problem was he played at Harvard we'll be right back\n\nFreakonomics radio is supported

Palin's drive the right kind of practice may be a parent or to to get you to the ring to the gym or the track five AM band as Shawn Johnson told us earlier might need some look\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach and the Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of this freak occurrence my coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese\nUm when he was three years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast and he\nKind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him\nHe he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians there were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson what started her training at different to them and I loved it it was awesome but chow my coach that took me to them ... opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching neat because it saved gas money and I was really really blessed to fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's\nAt different gym and I loved it it was awesome that child my coach that took me to an ... opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was really really last fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me safe and I am forever grateful for that\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether through bad luck bore through something much more concrete like lack of money over the past decade the youth\nSports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involved some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIt's a tournament in California this we go next week and you go about it after that it's Texas and I don't understand oh two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\nYou you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's just\nI don't understand how two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm\nAt the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play um [noise]\nI think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment or you name it over time it's starting to power itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players or\nIn one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid ... is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues\nIn the high school you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share a why didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing football baseball\nYou know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime flick Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably at high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominique Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nThen in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and marketing image advisor was like Mm do that that course slows gonna make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like no not going to do that\nSo instead you did was it American studies at American studies when journalism right in journalism which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing\nFootball [laughter] no I um I enjoy it\nAnd my academic advisor was like Mm do that that core slows going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices\nTheir labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like no not going to do that\nSo instead you did was it American studies yeah let American studies when journalism ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while\nPlaying football [laughter] no I um I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nFor football and I say I like to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you are given up through the course of your life\n[noise]\nYou shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he still feeling the after effects of his single minded\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me closer to that goal but give me further away from other\nImportant and interesting things including friends and including family and and then I Will say All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting I mean I think it's a feeling\nOf loneliness honestly which and it's not like I have

going to butcher the maid she quote but it's something to the effect of\nA when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like\nI was I didn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never

Lauren Murphy board about the athletes who make the sacrifices but don't make the big time\nJust look at the numbers there are only about Seventeen hundred players in the NFL major league baseball you're if you're the nine hundred the NBA just about five hundred in baseball roughly Ninety percent of the players drafted by major league clubs don't ever make it to the majors\nOne of those Ninety percent was just an Humphries you get a phone calls those how's it feel to be the next member of the east\nJust look at the numbers they're only about Seventeen hundred players in the NFL major league

those Ninety percent with Justin Humphries\nYou get a phone call says how does it feel to be the next member of the Houston Astros and you just get you get it 'cause it's a dream come true so I ended up signing\nHe started playing minor league baseball at Eighteen which meant skipping college although he did start taking some courses later on\nIn two thousand nine he retired at age twenty seven without ever making the majors he enrolled at Columbia University and took a sociology class with a professor named Sudhir Venkatesh\nSo I was sitting there in his classroom I started thinking about all the issues\nAre that I'd seen an independent baseball and affiliated baseball guys living check to check struggling with Louis you go back to school family life issues at home and I thought if I could use some of the things that we were learning in class talked to some of these guys and find out whether the stories and and things that I was seeing and hearing was reflected in the numbers\nWe followed a sample of the draft class of two thousand and one and so that's a but you know it's ten years and that is Sudhir Venkatesh and so we thought that would help us understand what happens to these folks\nI think one of the the the most curious things that we find is how much ten years matter so if you take two people who grow up in the same circumstances let's say one played baseball in one didn't\nThe person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they enter the game\nThen the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a

not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career All right so what kind of background is typical for these players you're tracking the average player probably looks like an upper middle class kid who comes out of college or comes out of high school\nUm and when you follow in upper middle class kid for about seven to ten years they're probably gonna make higher than the median average income they're probably going to live in a neighborhood that's relatively safe they're going to have a career now when you take the counterpart among the pool that was drafted that median kid\nThat kid looks like he's making about twenty to twenty four thousand dollars a year which is not a lot of money um he's working probably five to seven months playing baseball and then struggling to find part time work in the off season\nMight be coaching might be doing some training might be working on a construction site might be working in fast food\nWhen you're twenty five playing an independent
