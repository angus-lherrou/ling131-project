distinct odor and there's no smoke left behind that's one of the challenges for schools is that when you glimpse it you're not thinking oh that's a jewel they're smoking nicotine oil with that you

you see on social media\nThe easiest thing I can think of is figure out the new sources that you trust and then keep going back to them regularly and they they don't have to be people you agree with I

go to them visit them regularly pay for the news you don't you don't have to be a victim to the constant Twitter feed\nBecause but then I'm missing something then I feel like I might miss another
