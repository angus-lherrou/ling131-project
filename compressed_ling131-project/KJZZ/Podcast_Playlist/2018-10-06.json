Fifth Avenue is that's scheduled through four pm on Sunday currently it is eighty four degrees at one twenty two\n\nWelcome back and you're listening to my cats they lived on CBC NPR eyes public radio international [noise]\nToday we're exploring stories about parents children siblings it's chosen family is all kinds of family relations something that I think a lot of people have faced in adulthood\nIs how to forgive family members who may have heard us over the years\nIt's something I've heard a lot of friends talking about I've read a lot about it it seems as something most people struggle with\nThe science of happiness is a pod cast all about how to make your life better and be happy in this clip restored of justice expert Rosa ... speaks with ... with her about being a happiness guinea pig and attempting to forgive her father\n[noise]\nSo you chose this nine steps to forgiveness ... and I'm really curious because you've got this deep life background and philosophical background to restoration and forgiveness or\nWhat was it like for you so it was really powerful when the restarted justice interfaith roundtable started in San Quentin there were some men who said they noticed that when I spoke about my father\nThey heard resentment in my voice and anger so it comes from some things in my childhood I grew up in a family where there was oh just said there was alcohol yeah they said to me we're fathers there and when we hear that in your voice\nWe think about do our children resent us and so they said we would like for you too\nThey heard resentment in my voice and anger so it comes from some things in my childhood I grew up in a family where there was oh just said there was alcohol they said to me we're fathers there and when we hear that in your voice\nWe think about do our children resent us\nAnd so they said we would like for you to work on forgiveness with your father and I cried and I said no I don't want to do that right now and then\nMaybe a month later my father was diagnosed with cancer and he was given two weeks to two months so I had these like huge aspirations I was going to be able to go to my father\nMy father was hard working cowboy from this long line of to huddle cowboys\nAnd so sitting in circle and sharing the feelings sharing stories in that way was not a part of his life so I went to him and I told him I wanted to work on a forgiveness practice with him\nAnd we started and I shared about how I felt\nI felt harmed from some things in my childhood and I wanted him to recognize at least a couple of those things and he stood up and he asked me out [laughter] and like this Texas Ranger way and then I got upset and you know I'd probably cost\nHim out [laughter]\nAnd things got worse you know they'll have diners plan plan [laughter] and\nSo it was beautiful as the men inside St Clinton they really helped me they guided me on this process and said that's okay you mean the first step [laughter] and you chose to forgive and so these are the steps of forgiveness\nI did choose to forgive my father you know and I chose to work on it really messy for a long time trying to learn to drop my narrative the nine steps to forgiveness says that's part of why we suffer are now is we tell us\nAnd insights in Clinton they really helped me they guided me on this process and said that's OK you made his first step [laughter] and you chose to forgive and so these are the steps of forgiveness\nI did choose to forgive my father and I chose to work on it really messy for a long time trying to learn to drop my narrative\nThe nine steps to forgiveness says that's part of why we suffer are now is we tell ourselves stories and then those stories can change and we have to you know reflect on that yeah and I can talk to you about how I felt because that's important to get in touch like that's one of the first steps of forgiveness\nHow did you feel about this like what was not okay and so what I felt was that I was bad\nThat I was unworthy that I wasn't valued I wasn't heard or seen it was really important for me to make a commitment to feel better\nWhich is a certain stripped of forgiveness making a commitment to yourself to feel better because forgiveness really good for you and no one else\nYeah and so this is my father my father is a wonderful man that so many people love to ... this charismatic uses Chicano activist\nAnd so many people admired and loved him but growing up sometimes with someone who is an activist or public figure\nThat can be difficult uh and so I had to realize that he was a wonderful man many people saw him that way but I Lived with him and so maybe at times because he was so wonderful in the community I was neglected and so I needed to think about how can I feel better about that\nAnd it's funny how when we make these kind of commitments these meta level commitments to like you were talking about earlier I was like a narrative that you keep coming back to our guard and get it it just changes the dynamic of aren't committed to a different narrative and a sense of of whatever direction forgiveness day too uh-huh and then blame\nSo wonderful in the community I was neglected yup and so I needed to think about how can I feel better about that\nAnd it's funny how when we make these kind of commitments these meta level commitments to like you were talking about earlier I was like the narrative that you keep coming back to her guard and get it it just changes the dynamic of aren't committed to a different narrative and a sense of of whatever direction forgive mistakes you\nUh-huh and then blaming my father my father did a lot so could I not look at you know the bad but also look at the good and appreciate that yeah but also recognize my own feelings\nBlame him less and just like kind of give him credit for what he did do as a parent what what could I be grateful for\nAnd that helped me to listen my suffering was thinking about like I I'm so grateful that I was born into the family I was born in\nA tiny how these states go together sometimes that when we forgive and we recognize suffer in on the other side is this feeling of gratitude sometimes that I had this hard stuff but I got this out of it is interesting how they go together sometimes\nYes yes yeah I Do think that the life the universe keeps us opportunities are gifts yeah\nSo the next step to forgiveness is about understanding that forgiveness doesn't necessarily mean reconciling and also to stop expecting things from other people\nYes so give up expecting things from your life that other people choose to not give you so I wanted my father to give me an apology it didn't work like you just refused or did you ask 'em or so I was meeting with him and I had an agenda decker yeah\nI wanted him to change I couldn't change my father so how can I accept him for who she was so one of the things that the men in St Clinton invited me to do was to ...\nI wanted my father to give me an apology it didn't work well you're just refused or if you ask 'em or so I was meeting with him and I had an agenda decker yeah\nI wanted him to change I couldn't change my father\nSo how can I accept him for who she was so one of the things that the men in St Clinton invited me to do was to start at ... and his practice\nAnd to be kind to myself and to be kind to other people and so the greater good science center has wonderful [laughter] kind of practices so it took working with kindness and being kind to other people like super generous being very apologetic you know like a generous with my apologies\nGenerous with my time and also kind to myself because I think that's one of the hardest thing is I Need to have self compassion so it's a hard one uh-huh and realize that if I didn't feel loved and I didn't feel worthy\nHow can I meet those needs as an adult\nLike what can I Do to\nEmbrace that young little girl that wanted to feel worthy and feel good so how can I Do that myself so I worked on practices to do that and then I committed to a century and prayer meditation practice where do you do so I said I'm not going to say every day but I Try to sit\nSix months or so and we did it that January\nDidn't help me pick out flowers 'cause I didn't know colors he will try to describe what colors where\nBy um the tastes like purple scrape because I'm like a jelly like great [noise] um so he would tell me different kinds of flowers you know I didn't really care giving me I can see it like you know he would help if this was a pretty they don't you know so [laughter]\nI got to be quite the interior decorator ... the wedding planner I chose the flowers are drawn to pick out her wedding dress or help to coordinate the cakes and the colors and it went off without a hitch and it was so gorgeous\nIt was interesting to try to um [noise] you know feed him cake after the buddy how you give each other about a cake 'cause it's kind of hard to know where somebody's face it when you can't see it so I'm sure he probably had acting all over the place [noise]\n\nYou can't think about it much I mean sometimes I Do sometimes I'm sad people think oh you're such an inspiration immediately awesome that you don't even like you know after ... here and I'm thinking so I'm hoping I was going to have a shirt and they just said today I don't feel like

it\nCloudy at one forty one [noise]\n[noise]\nWe're back and this was podcast playlist on CBC the PR on public radio international this next story asks the question is family about genetics or is it simply a shared bond\nDaily done him was a junior in college when he decided to donate sperm he did to donating blood he saw it as an opportunity to do something good for a person who need to accept\nThat when you donate blood you don't get a tidal wave of children crushing into your life Twenty years later here's the podcast the leap\n... you know she had mentioned that nobody in her family could carry a tune in a bucket and so she got up there and saying and listening to her it was just just like such a way of me you know\nPresuming that given her her her family that I came from me it was this connection there was just like beyond space and time and it but it was real\nWas powerful stuff\nAnd he's choking up now not just because he's remembering that moment that also because he doesn't want to lose that feeling of connection\nBut I've done this a number of times now right and I don't ever wanted to get like feel like old hat\nBy a number of times daily means a whole lot of times Seventeen down her kids are now in contact\nIt's still the first time for them\nFirst time meeting him and also another the first time they hear each other saying that transcended karaoke experience with McKenzie that kind of thing happened with a bunch of them because it turns out the majority of these kids are singers when\nHis job\nAnd the other end job I'm In daily living room in Orinda, California always do with the donor Sarah Christian they're tired they were out like karaoke but I've made them saying\nNo oh\nWith a bunch of them because it turns out the majority of these kids are singers when\n...\nAnd the other end job I'm In daily living room in Orinda, California who was a donor Sarah and Kristen they're tired they were out like karaoke was why but I've made them sing no oh\nDo you say just as long as you can send me\nThis is one cozy see they're at work like close by Kristin lives in San Diego and his up visiting daily family for the weekend [laughter]\n... daily ten year old daughter climbers up on Sara's lap\nI adore do is like personal like little children that are\nLoves of my life so personal little children are dailies with his wife their shares half siblings Sarah also has a full blood older sister Molly Daly's her donor dad too\nFew years after Mali was born her parents went back to the sperm bank and by request daily briefly came out of donation retirement Sarah was the result she's the youngest of these donor conceived kids she's Eighteen most are between twenty two and twenty four\nIt's all very complicated but first Sarah it's just meant more family and it's great she spent a lot of time here since you met daily a few years ago she babysit and her sister and her two moms of all become close with daily family they'd Thanksgiving together this year my parents\nAnd daily are like good friends and I really feel like I'm interacting with them as a unit rather than to separate families that I'm trying to balance\nBut every donor kid has a different relationship with daily their families and how they integrate this new knowledge of their biological dad and siblings into their lives it's all so\nMoms of all become close with daily family they had Thanksgiving together this year my parents\nAnd daily are like good friends and I really feel like I'm interacting with them as a unit rather than to separate families that I'm trying to balance\nBut every donor kid has a different relationship with daylight their families and how they integrate this new knowledge of their biological dad and siblings and to their lives it's all so new and confusing Sarah I'm Christian talk about this with daily our whole situation\nIs just really complex and that it's no one's ever really had to deal with this type of relationship there's no language to really describe it\nAnd I'm Wondering yeah there you know etiquette there is no no one had yeah there's no manual knowing how this experience\nThat I can be like hey how did you deal with this we all just kind of had to figure it out for ourselves which\nI think is really cool\nWord pioneering something real sort of like on the first wave in society\nI think on that note to it's been an interesting thing trying to figure out\nNot only how to explain it but how to refer to everybody you know the like everybody refers to daily or something completely different because what do you what do you call him you know like sperm donor and like a guy who created me it was like all too much of a mouthful to explain you know like\nI introduce you to my friend and I said I'm his bond or something like I [laughter] but most of the time I refer to him as my donor dad because you know I wouldn't call and my dad because I also have my dad that raised me\nWho she is really close to it's a touchy subject Christian grew up as an only child with her mom and dad unlike Sarah she says she could never have Thanksgiving with their family or even just the other donor siblings because their parents can be hurt I don't ever want\nThem to think that I'm choosing this family over the other and that's just kind of a tough place to be in ...\nYeah because I also have my dad that raised me who she is really close to it's a touchy subject Christine grew up as an only child with her mom and dad unlike Sarah she says she could never have Thanksgiving with their family or even just the other donor siblings because their parents can be hurt I don't ever want them\nTo think that I'm choosing this family over the other and that's just kind of a tough place to be in because you want to exist in both places and in a way I kind of constantly am but it does get hard to do something\nBecause this world this community she now has or Nineteen new siblings that's including dailies young kids Christians dad doesn't want to hear about it\nAnd it does kind of sucks because in a way this has become such a such a big part of my life and such a part of my life that's larger than I could have ever imagined\nInitially Christian gotten to this whole thing just to find a sibling she had no interest in finding her biological dad\nHer mother saw something about the Donor Sibling registry on Oprah that's where kids can enter the donors number from the sperm bank confined to their matches\nShe signed up when she was twelve and found that half sister over the next five years more siblings found them then one got in touch with daily and now even though there are so many of them they are so connected there in touch on line everyday constantly\nWe have a group chat with daily and all the siblings we have a group chat with just all the siblings that we have like a fitness group chop politics group shot and then we have like Snapchat group chowder league in ...\nOne for a covert erroneous or for those real game of of of paleo people who have paleo got and this is just this morning we're just starts off with sterling who lives in Sacramento saying hey life goals when Eighteen get bumped off of a horse check and then\nIt was like all these other counter like are you know what the hell happened abuser all and that's\nNot even getting into the individual conversations I'd never go longer than like maybe two weeks without how the\nHer own use for those ... of paleo people who have paleo yeah and this is just this morning researchers started software sterling who is in Sacramento saying hey life goals when Eighteen get bumped off of a forest check and then there was like all these other counter like are you know what the hell happened\nAbuser all and that's not even getting into the individual conversations I'd never go longer than like maybe two weeks without having like a one on one conversation with every single one this is Brooklyn she lives in Phoenix she's a teacher and by the way she's a singer to she's starring is ... and a big production of beauty and the beast now\nBrooklyn was Twenty one when she found out she had a donor I was shocked but only for a minute and then the more I thought about it it kind of started to like\nMake a lot of sense because she and her brother and sister who are twins and also from daily sperm didn't feel like they had much in common with the family they grew up with\nBrooklyn and her siblings were some of the most recent to come into the group\nBut they play a pivotal role because their grandmother has a condo in Mexico and what would you do if you found out you had an enormous new extended family probably take a vacation together in Mexico [noise]\n\nThat was the
