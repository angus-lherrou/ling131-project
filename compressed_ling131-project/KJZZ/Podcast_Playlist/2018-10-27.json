words a story or practice that may have some grounding and historical fact but this is likely fiction and may be used to try and explain some deep truths about what it means to became and\nThere are a few different theories as to where the idea of buddy married came from some people say she's married tutor the first queen of England who live from Fifteen sixteen to Fifteen fifty eight\nMaybe it was the daughter of the famous King Henry the eighth and his first wife Katharine Merry gone around this time in England\nThe royal family was fighting over the official religion of England [noise]\nSome

terrible things started happening if their farm until it finally burned down\nThe wild is part of the very worst story is that there was also an accused which named Mary where it's who lived in Massachusetts and sixteen Ninety three around the same time as a Salem witch trials [noise]\nThe Salem witch trial took place between sixteen Ninety two and sixteen Ninety three when the town of Salem and the surrounding areas became so panicked about the possibility of which is living among them that they arrested dozens of people for witchcraft\nTwenty of them were found guilty and were executed so it makes sense that the story of a witch hunting a mirror might relate back to this time in American history\nThing that stands out to me ... all the stories of the potential marries and it may seem obvious but I Do think it's important the role of women\nAnd they're all women who were in whatever place in time they lived and made it to outcast or were labeled as bad or wrong and married

examples of people who are labeled as different\nBeing feared are treated cruelly\nEven when they aren't dangerous at all it seems that for all the Mary's there is a special significance to being
