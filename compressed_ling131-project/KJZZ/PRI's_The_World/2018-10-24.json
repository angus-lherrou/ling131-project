the world lately things have been pretty tense between the U.S and China and not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nNow contesting America's geopolitical advantages and trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the ... column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nDoesn't have to be on China is extremely keen that it should not they don't even wants to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one end to work out what America wants\nBought it used to be just a few hard liners here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiated with the America wanted to contain China and to stop China's rise\nThat fringe of hard line is is not spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints\nThey look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether there was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great superpower or the top of this of economic totem pole America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has decided to try and stop them and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and

this of economic totem pole America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging heck I'm On has decided to try and stop them and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders ... and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful than this has come out of out of the blew up and\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of the dishes like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nThat's really I mean those are those ... a retired very senior American official was in Beijing last week and it was all off the record so I Can't name and then he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to try and a lot for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about China went understood in\nDC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there was something to this the\nProblem is that the machine in Washington has kind of systematic structural things today wants China to do differently\nTo play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco to you know to what was something like the TTP by everyone opens their markets that bull Donald Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy\nI think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to\nNumber of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents in America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable properties this time it's called the United states\nAnd it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table\nBut there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you paid a low rent I I think that's the core of what Donald Trump is up to right now\nWhat is China's vision for the world\nSo he's a really interesting saying the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China\nChina is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know probably that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nThat's the go how'd they get that is not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one ... they'll try another if there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and and\nFor a long time they were game of the world trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months ago trade tensions and you get this when you talk to the European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing it turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike us\nToo much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and and\nFor a long time they gave me the world trading system and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months ago trade tensions and you get this when he talked to a European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese dissident Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike more than an American led worlds trading older is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gave me the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely\nSo suddenly the Chinese are quite in the order of reforming the WTO no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of this will be moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive\n... is the problem is that you can also see some very negative kind of forces that could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction or an absolutely confident the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because reasonably senior Chinese officials are now\nWorking their way down the list that people can explain to them and they got so low down the list are asking people like me and I literally have conversations with what I say I'm a reporter it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese said\nSo she says this was an ancient Greek historian heroes about when you had a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably the war and so he's been analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart and in a depressing number of cases that does trigger\nSo she says this was an ancient Greek historian who rose about when you had a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo ... Athens it ended up inevitably lead into war and so he analyzed the number of occasions of human history where\nThe state has ... finds itself being challenged by an upstart and in a depressing number of cases that does triggered armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stop this thing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of photons from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person these kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy\nI'm so they think as people age to go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries that no longer think that they are\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big\nThat it's too late to stop it it's it's a window to try and ... there was this extraordinary things on the Trump said I think it was at the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents subset of being ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so see that's a really extraordinary statement you know previous American presidents said\nYou know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in the right way you're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to ...\nU.N General assembly speech when he said the previous presidents such that have been ready to watch China rise to

and the way that you thought you were going to I'm going to stop it\nThat that is an incredibly bleak thing for Beijing to hit\nDavid Rennie of the economist speaking with us from Beijing thank you

Harvard shore instinct center\nShe's also involved in an effort called ... over a collaboration between twenty five Brazilian newsrooms to identify and debunk fake news\n... tells me that the fake stories she's seeing a WhatsApp are out of control\nWe make fun actually because the the misinformation campaigns in Brazil\nThey sometimes can get absurd in what way at their support in in the nice and fears that are totally known scenes like Venezuela supported by Hezbollah or stuff like this\nAnd I was coming here and I had a discussion with a friend that teaches at Harvard she was trying to convince me that the right wing candidate was the antidote to present you not becoming a Venezuela supported by Hezbollah\nSo ... was this teacher Brazilians\nShe's president and she probably heard this thing's via\nAnd I I started to last and it was like yeah you know what listen here's the website of control over this is ally this this this is nonsense please\nNot becoming a Venezuela supported by Hezbollah so ... was a teacher Brazilians she's president\nShe's Brazilian she probably heard this thing's via watch that\nAnd I I started to last and it was like yeah you know what listen here's the website of control over this is ally this this this is known since please you're a teacher at Harvard [laughter] but people believe this thing's\nSo is that one of the rumors that Hezbollah connection with Venezuela is that one of the rumors of spreading on what's happened Brazil\nYes this is pretty new this is fresh room or [laughter]\nThan there are the older still remembers making a comeback as Brazil's president ... seats up\nFor example we had a real more about the last candidate being the creator of something called ... which is supposed to be an educational heat to teach kids how to be gay\nWhile the implication being if you vote for the left wing candidate you're going to have gay kids in\nSchools and there will be connections with the government of Venezuela and Hezbollah the same time I see what you're saying but absurd\nUm just to be clear what definitive links have there been between these disinformation campaigns and either political candidate like the ... in our own launch those yeah that'll legitimate claim\nThis is a rule more from two thousand twelve it's just you up in the website of the right wing candidate\nHe created this a false information he was a a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to the Congress and several Congress person that are religious they supported him in this story and this became a monster\nBoth in our was also accused of creating another\nThe website of the right wing candidate he created this a false information\nHe was a a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to

Brazilian newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firms to buy a bundle of phone numbers\nAnd use them to mask tax propaganda to Brazilians through what's up Brazilian authorities are investigating those claims in the meantime people like you also do record of a are trying to put out the flame before they turn into a fake news wildfire and Brazil\nWhat's very interesting is that as far as I've seen of watch the news in this information\nThere is no story that is not in both platforms Facebook and watch that and what we see a different types of presentations\nSo when ... you have an all you see like there's this thing happening you have to act\nSo there's a call to action that's very strong shared this otherwise our country is going to be a Venezuelan five years share this to save our country stuff like this\nOn Facebook you have the same narrative is the same narrative but Facebook is more sophisticated they have videos have text\nSpecialist opinions all the things that make\nPeople believe to what I see is that there's an entire system if you look just to watch that uh we're not getting all the picture\nI mean I'm a I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but\nOur it too but Facebook is more sophisticated they have videos they have text specialist opinions all the things that make\nPeople believe so what I see is that there's an entire system if you look just to watch that ah we're not getting all the picture\nI mean I I I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have a a social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake news and what what are those guys I think we have a huge inequality in poor people are left behind in in so many things including education\nWe have a level of instability that was provoked by the impeachment\nOf Duma that may people was a former President Bill yeah ah they make ... made people believing in and they don't believe in these situations anymore neither the government or the newspapers\nFor and I know there is no east intuitions that they would believe right now and and this is also very important when you study fake news

what we didn't have with the ship pranks say this really fails missiles hostage thanks so puzzled\nIt's unlikely that the ship will ever be displayed on land the reason the shipwreck has remained in
