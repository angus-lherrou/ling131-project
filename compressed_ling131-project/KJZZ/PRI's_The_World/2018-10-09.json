intelligence can take you to the far end of the earth remote villages in Russia for example but getting intel can also be as easy as going online and doing a few searches the investigative news websites belly cat and the insider did both\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity a one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G argue Russian Army intelligence\nEric told her as one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had released about the cover daddy said this guy so we now know his real name is Alex on their Michigan but before he was ... and then as Alex hundred Petra which was his cover a day so you know totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere\nFor him to travel under um and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is a very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise] I'm In northern Russia\nSo that was a good starting point so talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information to discover identity from his real I get\nSo he looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that there's leaked databases from driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration an address\nProcess how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information or discover identity from his real identity [noise]\nSo we looked into a bunch of data base of some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're leaked the databases\nFrom driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find if you know where to look and sort of cross reference everything we could find and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan at the same birth dates and us from roughly the same village in the middle of nowhere\nAnd northern Russia and after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to his tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ before he went to medical school [laughter]\nYeah he he a DJ at the local club the one club I'm sure they had in the tiny village so we once these hunters in these databases of cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think would probably matched the true identity of Michigan\nI go to see some of the steps in in your process uh you and your investigators really seem to have to put yourself in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of um any vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all been forged in his head and the way forever but again these spies have real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to them so I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research on the stuff you wanted and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for an interesting details and cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the crumbling\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered\nSo I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you learned and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for and interesting details and cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the cherry which went first glance seems absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public\nAddress like on his driver's license the address of the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA well he did it because uh you know if you get pulled over and his car to cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually no everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address I'm an air traffic database we found is three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five hundred fifty you all have the same register to address that just says one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you\nAnd they all listed their vehicle registration as his address who they just don't want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get hold of her drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services so really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy knows so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose that always possible right because we know every time any investigation ... Russia people always chime in and saying well they wanted you to find it very well if they want us to find out why is no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration for these vehicles\nStrange sloppy and is so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose I always possible right because you know every time any investigation ... Russia people always China's saying well they want you to find the right well if they want us to find out why is no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration through these vehicles to the Jerry ... headquarters\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agents needs address same like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption in laziness\n... a few weeks ago your website building cat identified as a second person allegedly involved with this ... poisoning I have authorities in the u._k. or anywhere else been in touch with you about your findings\n[noise] uh no no no not really I mean I don't really have any in I don't think Elliot our founder has any contacts with UK police either um so we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in this all completely news and then we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spy in the digital age\nIt depends I I again I don't know if I have no idea I've never worked to the intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's much much harder than ever been before\nThat was our solar with the new site a bell in cats together with their partners that the insider they say they've uncovered the identities of two Russian intelligence officers suspected of poisoning former rushing saw Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the u._k. back in March and\n[noise]\nExcalibur she said no actually what the eight year old said was way better stay tuned and you'll find out\nWorld and you're listening to the world on Ninety One point\nOf poisoning for Russians sought Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia and the u._k. back in March\n[noise]\nExcalibur she said no actually what the eight year old said was way better stay tuned and you'll find out on the world\nAnd you're listening to the world on Ninety One point five and key genes easy dot org\nKj ... supported by banner at now whose mission is to make health care in Arizona simpler and more affordable you can see her banner at now is improving health care for members and employers and here to change dot com", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "09"}
