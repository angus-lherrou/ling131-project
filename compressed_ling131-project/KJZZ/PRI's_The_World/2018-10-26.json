and stand with my native brothers and sisters to protect our water\nSo now you've pivoted a bit I'm Still working with with ah natives and getting out the vote I Know standing voted ... is a campaign geared toward native populations in the U.S and in a a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota ... voter id law what does that last say\nSays that ah unless you

goes on all the time we know that all major countries eased drop and spy on one another but they shouldn't\nBe doing in such open crass ways\nThat seems to have gotten a bit last year you know it's sort of being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody and hasn't generated nearly as much heat as say the letter bomb story which is\nThe reaction that Christopher described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here where they're saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension\nUm that's generating a lot more passionate about what each than the thought that someone's a hack Donald Trump's iPhone\n[noise] now I Can't have a journalist from Germany and a journalist from Greece in an interview without asking you both you know your two countries have had some tensions in recent years you know over austerity and that kind of thing I mean Howard Harry your country is getting along these days I'm not [laughter]\n[noise] well I I think\nIn terms of a love affair slowly slowly liftoff from our prime minister was the

days [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I I think it's\nTurned into a love affair slowly slowly let's start from our prime minister Mr chipper us who um was elected in two thousand and steam with tens of thousands of people gathering in the center of Africans and repeating off him\nHe's very famous trying my dumb America go home he hates his\nEnd at the beginning this kind of the nation are between

quite special relationship began between them and it was not of course a lot of the book there at by any\nMeans but it was certainly a kind of a mother towards the child is a she seems\nTo kind of aid you chase him in the way it listen let's talk peacefully come here come to this room to sit by ourselves sometimes and let's talk it\nWe know now that he respects very very much the situation the relationship between the two countries I think is um is quite good\nJefferson how does it feel in Berlin yeah I I pretty much agree with\nThat is I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany so it doesn't commands or attention here probably as much as we command their attention there but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get their\nEconomic problems on to control they basically done what's the Germans have asked to them\nJefferson how does it feel in Berlin yeah I I Would pretty much agree with\nThat so I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany so it doesn't commands or tension here probably as much as we come in there that tend to live but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get their\nEconomic problems under control they basically done what's the Germans have asked to them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou're going to medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know I mean compared to like all bond in Hungary you know I'm a going out for a meal which puts the prime minister of Greece is probably a walk in the park\nIf I may just add another five but I'm sure the justice and those above it as well we we lost from a German or my my favorite football team or just lost one by immune to the days

York to be with her husband she left her country and her career behind it gets to be a nurse in the U.
