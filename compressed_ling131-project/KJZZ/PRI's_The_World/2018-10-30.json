the world studios thanks for coming by chance thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much do they interact with each other via the up\nWell it's remarkable the story Facebook and Southeast Asia is amazing in that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the defect do Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse the data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a the the

to\nUse data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of their digital lives so\nMaria wrestle we just heard from her more from her in a moment um we've reported on the story that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen so\nWhat happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to to tear today a during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness the power the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports\nAfter he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and paid followers that we're disseminating all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\nSo on Maria rats or a ... this activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock\nHere's an exchange between you James and ... so were you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting\n[noise] no I think\nUh uh ... this activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between you James and ... so were you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting\nYou know\nI think Facebook walk in to the Philippines and they were focused on what they didn't realize is that countries like the [noise] countries way institutions are ... these countries don't have the ...\nWhen you bring everyone onto a platform and do not exercise any kind of rules if you don't implement those rules for your point and the chaos\nSo James what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it um one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts\nBut as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly\nRecently in as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going

things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines but as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there\nDoes that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole\nI think that that there are fact checking project that they are trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country or in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinated about it is that\n... runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question which you raised several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's information\nFake news hate speech or what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at the age cue for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what's the standard for success here because there's no ability for us to audit them were really left in this position of having to take their word for it\nAnd whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know\nBut as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says and your dog and it's really it was a really powerful quote the very things\nAnd I asked people at Facebook you know what's the standard for success here because there is no

that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know that the horrific events here of the past week\nAnd seen that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media\nPolarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world views that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it\nI I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what data they're collecting around you um but ah it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who is in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I think one of the most important lines which is what are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention but it just so

to stand against anti Semitism whether it comes from the life or whether it's on similar yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews would be no firm hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much about a domestic these important Toyotas really due to the Trump support Israel in the Trump support the strong Israel so I'm Ron dreamers comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDidn't tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nUm say over all although there has been expressions of condolence to the expressions of shocking to hire\nThe the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact\nAs it had on the American Jewish community they don't\nFully understand the plays the synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews and synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school where they hide as I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you are playing kind of come of age\nAnd that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I put a share story I did I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of Jerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleventh\nYeah Hi I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play and kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I ... a share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from where all hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of Jerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of annoys we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that is when he was shot and and after the memorial in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this\nInteresting custom dream order Scottish which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the cash and that is traditionally a time but only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day\nThere will be nobody to stand for me so I stand for all of those who have no one to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing out to that standing up together it's such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nYou know the president does reveal are quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\n[noise] me think um [noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews are two very different paths right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that day\nAmerican Jews you know don't connect\nDo you know the president does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\nHere let me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews aren't too there and you can pass right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached\nTo their immigrant roots and because of that they tend\nTo support rights for immigrants they tend to very much\nBelieve in the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant which is\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to acknowledge that you know American Jews have\nDone fairly well to themselves in in America I'm and feel fairly successful into celebrate comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens them to be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still feel under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product of sort of post traumatic pose Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much and it sort of zero sum game at times you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know I'm\nThreats from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think you should those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlights those splinters\nReporter

would hope and that means the rates of changing the environment of essentially out pace the capacity of the calls themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was so gates was one of the very first scientists to make the connection between coral bleaching and global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties ended up very early days when none of us understood what was going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pay lanes and she was able to tie it to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her death gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adapt to warming oceans friend Virginia wife says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI don't remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking jets to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon\nAnd she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described\nI don't remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room I feel like she's talking just to them she had this wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon\nAnd she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at if she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an iconic closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of corals very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster to be able to tolerate\nThe heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly shoes and iconoclast in terms of\nThe way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues aside to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world of coral science\nA more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help his coral reefs are in the face of the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events\nAnd the rest of the news isn't good I'm In

coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades\nAnd yet Rick Gates remained so optimistic how did she retained that optimism all studying something so depressing\nWell it's such a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her loss she just looked forward and she felt like\nKnow we can try our hands up and give up or we can look for solutions and I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates\nHer laugh you know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that field around people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean ... and she laughs she left early and often
