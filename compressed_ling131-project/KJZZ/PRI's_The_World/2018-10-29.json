his life\nIf you talk about the winter then you come to spring here come to summer more and more pressures of time\nHis new book capture some of those times it's called I weigh Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand three in several photos he documents the final days of his father I ... a lot of China's fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities after he\nPassed away I feel you feel you're little and they don't belong to anybody and uh\nAnd maybe that's the moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically prepared and for me to become a new boss for myself a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather feel\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us a story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six\nAnd uh and maybe that's the moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically ... parish and for me to become a new boss for myself a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather failed\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us the story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that offense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society Irish and have a clear\nHierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party\nAnd even he was the same generation is a state leaders chairman mall drawing an eye on those people they weren't together but uh but he was heavily criticized author writes has in some way against\nThe party so your father was in that inner circle with now oh yeah yeah they're really core which is supported the ruble ocean or part of their ...\nBundle eight of course have being kicked out or from the party has untied revolution and uh spend about the ten years so yeah I ... well not just allowed to ride towards his name's totally disappeared in the public\nSo the memorial how did that memorial first they decided to his body has to be\nCovered by communist flack\nIs very high on there and that means you're you're part of it is a revolution by the time I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know he's made against his will\nSo I made that argument that says we don't need covers out a flak did they\nIt's very high on there and that means you're you're part of it is a revolution but I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know it's me against his will\nSo I made that argument that says we don't need covers out a flak\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said you'll find that doesn't just been onto your family you know which is very good argument and they say ever since the announce to the Communist Party or state was it a convincing argument though no it's not it's a it for me and say insulting\nTo somebody you know and have suffered so much\nThat they are being covered by that piece of red button kit with this Hummer and because of that cycle cycle you know it\nIs for me it's brutal hurts me and then there were the flowers flower as this kind of Sarah money the I'll use the same set of on paper flowers you know\nIf someone you spend the next day or a week later somebody dies the oh yeah yeah yeah same I I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use and isn't being used before\nSo they say why they're going to do I set out while buys a fresh ours my father's point his art has seen hockey heath life a civil war much relate to the highest static judgment on a moral judgment\nSo I said I have to change it so they send out a A R people bought all they'll fly to four hours in Beijing city wow I Know they made a fresh for bad so he can sleep in the middle but still covered by this red\nA civil war much relate to the highest static judgment on moral judgment\nSo I said I have to change it so we send out a A R people the bald all the ... forest in Beijing city wow I never made a fresh for\nBad so he can sleep in the middle but still covered by this red blanket\nWhile your father was ill you did this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smash teaching dynasty porcelain and a ... dynasty earned and you were photographed smashing another and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying\nJust not really much ideas is really attitude or some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action you see ... to that kind of ... and all the time was your intention to shake up the Chinese public you know it's not possible you'll have no path\nFor the rest of society is in deep sleep and they don't care it\nWas interesting something you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out and I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing your finger\nAt the Hong Kong's skyline appointing or middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger\nIs just so sad to serve your ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm Me grow older you know and the U.S individual in this society what else do I mean he's just give voluntary opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nIt's just so sad to serve your body in king ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm a girl or whatever you know [noise] and the U.S individual in this society what else do I mean it's just give out opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't really sinks outweigh you know on the surf racing on the\nShallow surveys yes us are defending individual rights are human rights but deeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump seems to reject that idea how do you feel about this reality as you were removed\nTo the end of the reality is about how you you as a nation still have a power to accept the difference still have an allergy or\nDo young enough to take that challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the

important to all of us no matter where we live because it's providing a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo that promote for us that we have here was

kind of taking the plug out of the freezer and the stars and she saw\nAnd so then one from a frost it starts to truly saw than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because migrants are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing\nBasically and then they emit carbon so it's micro breath that we have to worry about [laughter] basically [laughter]\nMicrobes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn upper basin gets liberated\nThe up

released\nI think the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon book stores here in the ... we're trying to actively to figure
