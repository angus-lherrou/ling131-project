the Arctic Circle is moving and that's because the axis of the earth is moving slowly racking up and down between twenty to twenty four and a half degrees or seen says this movement happens in a predictable cycle\n... forty thousand years twenty five years and years and one grocery store on your toes and use\nBirth it's called ...\nAnd it changes the amount of the planet that goes into total darkness and total daylight every year when the earth's axis gets closer to straight up and down the Arctic Circle shrinks when it gets more tilted the circle spreads out\nRight now we're somewhere in the middle of that cycle heading closer to straight up and down so the Arctic Circle is moving north and for Iceland this means that it's slowly slipping away Grimm's he is currently don't only habitable spot in the country touched by the Arctic Circle\nAnd that's drawn tourists here for decades as the Chrysler describes\nWhat they did his you know just when you arrived in the plane as soon as the sign the maid of honor medium and dots where the unload the tourist up there but I think we're walking around the science and give them a certificate and send them back home again\nIn twenty Thirteen the local government decided this simple Arctic Circle marker was due for an upgrade so they launched a competition and like Christian said earlier the information they put out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year\nBut stores teen told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that an average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touch currency for a few more decades\nI had to leave the Harlem to learn from forties showed one would be if you go to live with him you know after\nPut out said that the Arctic Circle is moving fourteen centimeters a year but stores teen told them it was actually moving a whole lot more than that an average of fourteen meters a year in the spot and at that rate the Arctic Circle only touch currency for a few more decades\nIf I had to leave the island to learn from forties chauvinists if you go to live with him or you know\nAfter that the Arctic Circle will leave all of Iceland behind for thousands of years until the earth's axis begins to swing back in the other direction this was not great news for the people have ... they'd always been told the Arctic Circle ran through the middle of their island\nWith when we moved from was older than you saw this is true [noise]\nSteven Christian realized they had a decision to me sick and ignore the science of how the Arctic Circle actually works and just make another stationary monument in the same old place\nOr they could let this new information we shave their whole idea for the monument and as you've no doubt gassed they decided the complicated facts were much more interesting than the nice easy fiction\nSo so everything is changing openings only move\nSo we had lots of different ways of representing this moment\nAnd then gradually it crystallized into something as simple as a sport because it's something you can move around it also represents what we're all because everything that we're talking about or thinking about is actually affected by ...\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much ... are really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presidents and certain physicality and sit and wait\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter\nEverything that we're talking about or thinking about is actually affected by ...\nOkay so some kind of ball something that rules but also something that doesn't roll too much ... are really windy place\nIt has to have a certain presidents and certain physicality a certain way\nSo an enormous mall of concrete ... tons it's three meters in diameter or about nine feet\nSo it's it's bigger than us now there was the thing that we realize that has to be\nBig enough to be something that you couldn't put your arms rocked it even if five people linked ... it'd be it'd be having a struggle so it's it's something you you can't contain it has its own life does its own thing and we just have to follow unlike now even though we know he's going north the summer it will go south\nYep you heard that right it's even more complicated\nThe Arctic Circle isn't only moving in one direction moon has referred to source team says that has the earth's axis ways back and forth about twenty thousand years in each direction there is a much smaller faster wobble happening as well this one is caused by the moon\nOn stewardship bailouts Eighteen points to choose\nWhat it comes down to is this the movement of the Arctic Circle isn't a straight line it's a squid all a big line moving in one direction with a bunch of smaller little ... and then just when I thought I really understood what was going on or seen said this\nWas an awesome as one factor comes into a deeper never think about that a lot to use the movement of the U.S crushed this is something we can't predict very accurately\nOf the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all this my heart kind of went out to Steve and Kristin\nThis regard as one factor comes into a deeper numbers single burger of Arthur's the movement of us crushed this is something we can't predict very accurately\nPieces of the earth's crust are also moving in that throws another wrench in the works I have to say as I was learning all this my heart kinda went out to Steve and Kristen and the competition organizers\nIt seemed like a simple challenge make a monument to the Arctic Circle on this tiny little line the human beings have drawn around the top of the earth\nBut the deeper these two went into it the more complex it became\nBut I think that's also something you accept this you get older you realize that you don't have a girl from everything the older you get the more you realize you don't do\nThis kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're going to take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution you may have heard this yourself and\nWondered could there be anything to that so let's take a quick look\nOf all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years the warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed\nWell let's take a quick look first\nOf all the earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years the warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades\nAnd the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact so we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to change or do we accept the truth as difficult as it might be\nWhen it came to making this Arctic Circle monument Steven Kristen chose option number two they open themselves up to the more complicated truths\nAnd it turned out to lead to something pretty darn cool [noise]\nThis is a moving user information stroke which which is nothing you can touch or see I'm not so interesting about the object is following this our dear\nBully is the least important thing about the piece itself is the movement what the bull does is it represents the movement\nWe humans don't really like change we like sharp lines and from definitions but the actual physical world doesn't work this way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature instead they're occurs twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nEverything every little thing that showed\nEven it turns out the Arctic Circle and an eight ... of concrete\nDefinitions but the actual physical world doesn't work this way it's really hard to find a straight line in nature instead they're occurs twists and blurred boundaries and always always change\nEverything every little thing a shorter\nEven it turns out the Arctic Circle and an eight ton ball of concrete both of which are scheduled to leave the island in the year twenty forty seven\nI'm not swim Christian and I go up there with a ... frames and kick it into the ocean\n[laughter] what does it says Walker agreeing [laughter]\nSo the question we started with here is what is the Arctic and the answer anything above the ... line which fluctuates between sixty five and a half and sixty eight degrees north which is so messy and complicated there's really nothing about the Arctic that all these are rules\nFor the world I mean the Martin frenzy Iceland\nAmy's reporting as part of our partnership with the
