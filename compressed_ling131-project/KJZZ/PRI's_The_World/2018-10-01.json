investigation into an atrocity committed a few years ago more and the science and the investigation in a moment first a warning that you're about to hear some graphic details in this story the story begins as I said\nWith an atrocity [noise] this is a moment from a video that went viral this summer and it's a killing is about to take place soldiers are walking to prisoners down the road you can just about here one of the soldiers whistling Conrad is filming and commenting\nOn losses [noise] below nominated him for\nThe prisoners are two women plus a young child and a baby [noise]\nTwo shots were fired in all the women and the children were killed\nBut it was unclear who was shooting or where this happened at first glance of guess might be that it's somewhere in Africa but that's about it\nThen a team from the BBC's Africa I investigative unit went to work and thanks to science and technology they managed to zero in on not just where these killings happened but also the identity\nThe women and the children were killed\nBut it was unclear who was shooting or where this happened at first glance against might be that it's somewhere in Africa but that's about it\nThen a team from the BBC's Africa I investigative unit went to work and thanks to science and technology they managed to zero in on not just where these killings happened but also the identity of the likely shooters those alleged shooter's are now in custody\nTell me a lot of people the b._b._c. African security correspondent joins us from Nairobi are really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually crack this case [noise]\nWell I think first of all there was just the the shock\nThat gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning\nAnd it began you know just conversations across to each other with different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is so anybody have any idea\nWhat what this terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started and lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a full on the investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology played in that\nWell [noise] I mean there are parts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be any way and the ...\nWhich is wide across west in Central Africa a botched with many heads put together a one of them was Amnesty International the rights of group which had been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that\nAnd you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know looking at the uniforms listening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was camera and this was northern capital of course that's also a vast\nWith many heads put together a one of them was Amnesty International the rights group which had been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know looking at the uniforms\nListening to some of the dialogue and it's um an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was camera\nWhen this was northern Cameroon of course that's also a vast region\nBut over time trying to match the topography as you could see in the video there are certain distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and using those ridge lines matching them to Google or in digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location\nThat's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that ritual on match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only rich line that has that shape and all of camera room\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy but they won't ... so many clues put together not just the rich line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue when you have another clear you sort of bring them together\nAnd that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed was it was when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that an addict everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it yeah\nAnd you also worked with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experience in this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nOf all the government tried to deny initially that these were Cameroon and soldiers they said you know the uniform on was not watch um the the soldiers are the way up north um it's\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it yeah and you also worked with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experience in this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nFirst of all the government tried to deny initially that these were Cameroon and soldiers they said you know the uniform on was not watch um the the soldiers are way up north\nUm they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the union army will serve on some of the the uniforms\nWere indeed ... military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and co found that those were Kembrew Indian soldiers but then in the dialogue as well some of the soldiers were saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy\nBut around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tone and said well they had the rest of the sudden people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had no official names and so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details\nOf your parents still you know you can show on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier cold ... and apart from just to Facebook you know we found a will to speak to a former camera onion soldier who also confirmed that this was indeed Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out in the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime two women two children and ...\nBook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier called ... and apart from just to Facebook you know we found a way to speak to a former can ruin your soldier who also confirmed that this was indeed Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for the violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these are women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram\nAnd there's a point where I Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of\nA tells this child that um you know so you have to do this kind of thing and and and\nUm basically saying it's it's the parents' fault or you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers are no forwarding these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback or to this investigation has the b._b._c. Africa gotten from the public like from Cameroon and no jury itself\nFeedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by is the message\nYou know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the angle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fire up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a ...\nYou know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the angle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fired up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a camera and people in particular have been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and their forces accountable\nThe video or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to what to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen it festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nAnd it's something you can't really you race from your from your mind so uh it's not something easy to watch\nA but it it doesn't necessarily job to to be done to when you have to expose these kinds of things I'm the last of atrocities around the world sometimes you have to go to the hard way uh to be able to to get to the depths of all these things and expose them\nThat's my colleague told me a lot of people the BBC's Africa security correspondent thanks very much You're welcome [noise]\nYou know let's say that a child was moved from a facility where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty children so much more of a homey environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects learn some English the also\nHave regular attention will have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experienced some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving and or possibly in route and so and so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access that they need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like turning out this emergency facility we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work walks but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it but you know they've just been transition there\nThat um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work books but\nThat's not a education yet not far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus is on the child to to ask for it but you know\nThey've just been transition there from a different facility they don't know anyone there disoriented possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stabilizing\nYeah ... ... when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help with that connects us [noise]\nUm well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent\nShelters are provided with an you know your rights presentation um they receive screening and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues um\nYou know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the time came facility and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMinimum the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we have a system\nWe have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in this country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff for those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process and\nThe fixes 'em how to respond to the\nShow I mean I think we had a\nSystem we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in this country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in the system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nFor those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the process doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not a ... it's not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I I Am hopeful and the thing that I think I'm I'm I'm you know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know\nDoing a lot of visits certainly it's a different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from from a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously it's one thing to have that versus\nYou know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsored as soon as possible\nLeader trouble as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much President Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency this change would essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public\nWell Leah ... an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much President Trump's crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency\nThis change would essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen that happening but Lucy is a pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule as a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who is applying for a visa or for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services\nThat include healthcare and Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to child and family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still in the proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nAnd this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even wake or the women infants and children program and four months parents have been asking if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's uh\nSeeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nOf this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even wake or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you can tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so\nAs recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as with many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so well she was also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula if needed or food assistance but she declined\nI'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S so I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all the support\nThat they could get if their families were not being placed in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nShe'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S so I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support\nThat they could get if their families were not being place in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either\nStability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice for the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately of an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so\nWhich which really is a lifeline for a lot of my family is they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nProvides healthy foods and includes housing assistance 'em and other services that actually allows them to be healthy and stable so that they can contribute to the United states to our economy to our society\nOr the lawn rifle loosely pediatrician in Washington with the Children's National health system also a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics thank you very much for being with us\nIt stamps that provides healthy foods and includes housing assistance I'm In other services that actually allows them to be healthy unstable to that they can contribute to the United states to our economy to our society\nDr
