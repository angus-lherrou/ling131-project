chief was killed so it was kind of ... police chief Abdul rustic\nSearches new ... well from a decade she spent living in Kandahar shades around nonprofit groups and then became an advisor to the U.S military\nI actually got to know before the fall of the Taliban in fact he was part of the gang that the U.S had\nDesignated as one of its proxies on the ground and so when I crossed the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan you know we're talking December ninth or something like that two thousand and one I stopped off it has directs you know to say Hi and he\nAnd his crowd he wasn't my closest friend in that group but he and his\nCrowd gave me a bodyguard and couple of guns with which I then drove into Kandahar\nSo what kind of man was the I mean what did you see 'em a time that you spent with Abdul Raziq\nWell as I say he wasn't my best friend and I stayed a bit away from him I liked a colleague of his or tried to men in Cali give his who told me in those very early days basically what\nAre warlords like me doing in the police we wanted a government after the fall of the Taliban that would be a government of rule of law I shouldn't even be in the police whereas Resnick was exactly the type of war last\nPaid a bit away from him I liked a colleague of his uh tribesmen and colleague of his who told me in those very early days basically what\nAre warlords like me doing in the police we wanted\nA government after the fall of the Taliban that would be a government of rule of law I shouldn't even be in the police whereas Resnick was exactly the type of warlord who exploited his relationship with the United states to carry out some pretty abusive practices\nThere was a significant tribal rivalry on the border there there's a\nTon of commerce of all kinds that cross that border and he set to work consolidating his position because of his American backing quite brutally quite abusive Lee and consolidating personal wealth and and as I say his sort of political and military position on the border not a popular guy\nYeah I mean you're touching on actions that sound like a abuses of human rights\nNo kidding and even that is pretty sanitized language you're talking about a guy who would take people out into the desert and have a shot\nA when he was first brought in from the border to kind of hard to sort of take command of a big surge a General Petraeus had him\nPlay this role in two thousand nine I mean it was massive sweets of the countryside indiscriminate rounding up of people shooting of people and then when he became chief of police I mean it was a reign of terror and come to her and so this was a guy who was tested\nBy much of the city and in fact I communicated with General Petraeus that there are some legal issues with the United states partnering with this guy there is a law called the lady act\nWhich prevent the United states military in particular from partnering with military unit that are known\nI mean it was a reign of terror in Kandahar and so this was a guy who was tested by much of the city and in fact I communicated with general betray us that there are some legal issues with the United states

abuses of human rights and it was just it was an open\nSecret everybody knew it was this one you were advising US military and\nI've got sent back so we're talking now two thousand nine so some eight years after I first met rustic\nI mean the the us commander general Austin Miller had a real praise for residents he said he was a patriot he said the good he did for Afghanistan will never fade away so I I mean how big a compromise was the U.S making and partnering with Resnick\nA gigantic compromise and what's so I mean I get it when someone's been chilled you can't exactly you know keep shame on him but um it's very distressing to me that\nIn all of the year since this conflict U.S officials and officers have not understood the basic equation that when somebody is brutal and tested by\nBy the population that you're trying to wage war on behalf of um\nYou know he might kill a couple of insurgents or even many insurgents but his behavior is creating I don't know how many more for
