community contrary says that was a powerful moment for her one son asking about the risks people's face when running for office\nThe other asking why she wasn't taking a bigger risk for a more prominent position there are a lot of people who don't know what the attorney general does but after serving\nIn the Obama administration and creating a nonprofit that provides free legal services\nCountry or is as attorney general may help decide things like whether Arizona will try to repeal the Affordable CARE Act or Obamacare\nShe wants to keep it the Republican incumbent mark bird

themselves as a single group\nWe don't always\nSee issues from that lens\nBut we certainly can see when others are trying to constantly make issues about ethnicity\nFrom the other side and that is I think something that we will stand up for it and reject because I think it's clear to a lot of people including Latinos that there are people in power right now who want to treat\nAs a second class citizens\nThat may have helped spur a record turnout in the primaries last month with a big showing by democratic voters are lists drivers confirmed he'll be one of them in next month's election\nAnd

the primary Republican strategist Constantine Kirkegaard acknowledges that Republicans are vulnerable with some promises unfulfilled\nThey have not yet built the law they have not yet you know gotten rid of Obamacare and so you have a certain amount of frustration within one party's base and a great deal of energy in the opposition parties base and that's what can make these midterms a challenge\nBut ... says Republicans are entrenched in Arizona and they brought more resources into the state this election cycle using more database strategies to target voters crowd says Trump and his plans for an expanded border wall or popular among GOP voters here including Latinos\nYou know the this idea of the Latino voting this monolithic vote that moves in a single direction really isn't true the highest rate of Hispanics Latinos in Arizona the last several years have all been Republican and a lot of Hispanics in Arizona who are here legally\nTend to be some of the strongest advocates for border security so they don't respond to that knee jerk fashion that if you're secure borders that means you don't like brown people\nSo crowd scoffs at the idea that Latino candidates contrary us

incarceration children in foster care and immigrant families in detention\nContrasts response that her role as state attorney general is limited but she'll do what you can enjoy other attorneys general in their fight against the Trump Administration\nI mean the bottom line is that this is a moment where I'm running for attorney general this is one line on your ballot but people in Arizona right now are choosing what version of Arizona they believe in\nAnd will that be in Arizona where we come together where we are fighting for one another or is it going to be in Arizona that adopt this us versus them for a longer period of time [noise]\nSome polls show the Arizona attorney general race as tight others give the Republican candidate a clear edge it can ... wins she'll be the first

Chinese by apprehended in Belgium and brought to the U.S to face charges hand when us tariffs on Chinese goods hit workers at a Chinese factory right here in the U. S. you're with the world\nAnd employees had actually taken these trade secrets and had used them to build a factory in a third country and we're producing products\nAnd employees had actually taken these trade secrets and had use them to build a factory in a third country and we're producing products\nAre you able to tell us the name of that company [noise] I don't think [laughter]\nYou know cases though where American companies who had a things stolen from them in ... you know technology and and secret and have they ever been able to litigate cases\nAs a matter of fact they have and uh the situation is really improving in China you go back Twenty years and the Chinese didn't have much in terms of\nA legislation for protecting intellectual property\nBut over this period the legislation has improved quite markedly now enforcement has remained a challenge but even enforcement is improving\nThe big exception is in trade secrets for our companies that remains probably the biggest area of ... intellectual property that is difficult to protect why\nBecause there isn't a proper legislation on this and uh I Know that the Chinese are working on it and the U.S over the years have worked with the Chinese and capacity building\nIn other areas of the pie and this one seems to be like the last frontier um but uh but we're all working on it still\n[noise] what's the threats that comes with trade secret theft is it a security threat an economic one or both well I Would say\nAnd the U.S or over the years have worked with the Chinese in capacity building in other areas of pie and this one seems to be like the last frontier um but uh but we're all working on it still\nIs threats that comes with trade secret theft is it a security threat an economic one or both well\nI Would say uh in\nIn the case that we are reading about this alleged the ministry of security person it's it's both um in most of the cases in which I was involved it was really most economic your technology has been stolen and products like yours\nAre being produced um and so your market\nShare will shrink President Trump's been really vocal about China stealing us intellectual property but presumably this has been happening for a while that way before Trump\n... is the problem getting worse or is it just that President Trump has decided to be more vocal about it than previous presidents it's the ladder\nDon't see that the problem is getting worse [noise] uh and in some ways I think this trade friction that we're uh we're now in the middle of this [noise]\nUm I think that the real crux of this issue is reciprocal treatment a yes IP violations have been going on for a long time and the U.S has talked with China for years about this but we have never before applied pressure\nYou know I feel that we've had this grand bargain with China for a long time in which um we knew these things were going on and we would talk with the Chinese about it and yet we wouldn't apply the leverage because we were also benefits\nTime uh and the U.S has talked with China for years about this but we have never before applied pressure\nYou know I feel that we've had this grand bargain with China for a long time in which um we knew these things were going on and we would talk with the Chinese about it\nAnd yet we wouldn't apply the leverage because we were also benefitting from the relationship we were getting less expensive goods consumers were happy companies were making money even political leaders\nTheir voters were getting a less expensive product and stretching dollars and it just came to a tipping point er and and so now we're applying pressure\nUh so I I think the approach that we're taking we have to the U.S that is has to come with the idea that OK you've been doing these things but we have been more or less complicit because we really didn't apply pressure until very recently\nWilliam Zarit is chairman of the nonprofit American Chamber of commerce in China he's been speaking to us from Beijing thanks so much thank you more\nNow on the strained business relationships between Chinese companies and the U.S only this story is mostly about the effect of tariffs on American workers\nA few years ago Massachusetts wanted to make a big order for new subway cars for the Boston area but there was one stipulation they had to be made in Massachusetts\nEnter the Chinese railway rolling stock corporation or see our our seat the company won the contract and build a factory about a hundred miles from Boston well that was before the new trade war between the U.S and China under President Trump\nNow the future of the factory and it's a well paid workers is in doubt Adam Reilly from our partners here at W. GBH in Boston has the story\nWhen you pull off to see our our seats\nEnter the Chinese runaway rolling stock corporation or see our our seat the company won the contract and build a factory about a hundred miles from Boston well that was before the new trade war between the U.S and China under President Trump\nNow the future of the factory and it's a well paid workers is in doubt Adam Reilly from our partners here at W. GBH in Boston has the story\nWhen you pull up to the see our our seed planted Springfield, Massachusetts the first thing you notice is the size two hundred thousand square feet sprawled over once vacant\nLot stuff inside and you see just a fraction of that space is currently in use though the activity there is intense right now see our our seats workers are building six cars for Boston transit system\nBy twenty twenty there'll be sending eight new cars per month eventually delivering more than four hundred that's good news for riders use to shabby decks\nAnd even better news for workers like Eric Anderson I was a cook better cook for about seven years then CRC a massive state owned Chinese companies open this facility on Springfield eastside\nAnderson gotten assembly job in significant and pay it probably double with the benefit from what I was making also reaping the benefits you sat there who moved from Vermont for his job as a lead mechanical assemble\nIf I'm perfectly autism was on anything out of the water the stuff up there currently but I'm aware of uh especially\nIn this field the coming years should bring more solid blue collar jobs like theirs to Springfield CRC built subway cars not just for Boston but also for Philadelphia and LA but now there's a hitch significant uncertainty linked to President Trump's escalating trade war with China\nSo far the terrorists and new policies have an impact on our manufacturing and also are CRC\nLike theirs to Springfield CRC built subway cars not just for Boston but also for Philadelphia in LA but now there's a hitch significant uncertainty linked to President Trump's escalating trade war with China studious\nYet so far the new tariffs and new policies have an impact on our manufacturing and also on CRC\nJob of who spoke with us through an interpreter is the vice president of see our our sees Massachusetts operation he says since some of the parts used here are imported from China the Trump administration's\nTariff to ... million new cost there's also bipartisan interest in banning CRC from bidding on federal projects and even talk of labeling the company a national security threat\nCritics say CRC under bids to gain market dominance and the technology on its vehicles could be used for surveillance but shot instead the company\nIs a force for good ...\nCRC at that point here in the United states to say we have a long a growing plan\nAnd we are definitely brain benefits for taxpayers here said from twenty twenty why the job creation will sleep from there if there is no additional new others coming on board regarding to the new terrorists and the new restrictions on the company\nWhich is why politicians like Springfield mayor dominance Arnold him democratic congressman Richard Neal want the Trump Administration to reconsider also hoping the president\nShips course Jon ...\nYou know this day and age in Springfield we need the manufacturing we haven't had manufacturing here in the years\n... is the business for sheet metal workers local sixty three and he's real by the RCs embrace union labor\nThere's over a hundred and twenty union workers from Springfield Americans but now he says Trump's of ...\nConsider also hoping the president ships course Jon ...\nYou know this day and age in Springfield we need the manufacturing we haven't had manufacturing here in years\n... is the business for sheet metal workers local sixty three and he's real spicy RCs embrace union labor\nIs over a hundred and twenty union workers from Springfield Americans\nBut now he says Trump's approach is jeopardizing that\nYou're going to possibly put them out of work if they can't get contracts they can't you know maintain this building and I do believe he wants to put people to work but yet I don't think he realizes the impact of what he's doing over here\nThen again see are RC now plans to circumvent Trump's tariffs by shifting the production of certain parts for China to the u._s. which could mean more new jobs not left and convince the president's supporters he knows exactly what he's doing for the world Adam Reilly Springfield,
