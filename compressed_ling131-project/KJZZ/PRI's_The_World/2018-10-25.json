government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's it's complex because there's hon people that live in this province who've lived there for decades those people that are from this older group many of them grew up with leaders in school in their neighborhoods from their perspective what's happening to the leaders is appalling\nMany of them talked about this as being something similar to the cultural revolution in the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWhere populations were polarized an extreme way and all speech and action was politicized so there's a lot of concern there from this older group the newer group of people that I met people that came to the province more recently are much more positive about the approach the state is taking they see it as something that needs to be done has essential\nOr many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pins that had Xi Jinping's face on them or\nThe Chinese flag they call each other comrades or sort of a patriotism fever

quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation either in the camps or in tight surveillance\nAnd then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to these Chinese medium schools now that they'll be able to assimilate into mainstream society so their position is really quite fraught and
