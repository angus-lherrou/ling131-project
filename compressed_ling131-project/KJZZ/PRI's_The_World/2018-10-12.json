five scenario but it may not be that far from reality\nThat at least is the warning coming this week from a new report from the government Accountability Office found that the country's next generation weapons systems could be easy targets for cyber attacks\nThat made some experts in the field I think about the TV show Battlestar Galactica [noise]\nAnd it's an enemy civilization has taken

one of the weapons systems at the center of this report\nVery good an unanswerable question actually this report is written it is an unclassified report but these ... weapons systems are themselves classified so nowhere in this report or the weapons systems themselves named\nWe can do that these are everything from jet fighters to anti missile interceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing wow\nSo so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find all sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that basically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily\nIt kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing\n[noise] wow [noise] so so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that basically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are only for high level hackers\nTo take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into systems some of these things were just\nThat they found be fault password hadn't changed on the software of these systems so the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by guessing passwords in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds\nAnd in some in many cases\nThe DOD weapons developers did not notice that the testers were in their system acting like hackers and they even didn't notice when the testers we're trying to be intentionally noisy to make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nNow to be clear these are weapons systems that are already deployed or are they things that are being developed and are going to be deployed what what kind of time period we're talking about so we are talking about systems that are being developed the reason\nWhy this report was done by the government Accountability Office was at the Senate Armed forces committee asked them to look into the\nAh weapons

Ontario for a very long time\nOr family has been on this piece of land um says Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has evolved a lot since then it's also made a huge leap sends Armstrong graduating college thirty seven years ago today each have is three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk in the computer measures they're out for\nThe call or that they have on them says id but it also measures her eating habits on an individual ... measures for room in the stomach flu was to make sure that that's going well [noise] it measures are lying down time and measures her activity\nCombine that technology with better breeding and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago\nThis might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management\nEach farm has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent that's what's enraged President Trump's candidate does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the\nHas a system called supply management\nEach farm has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent\nThat's what's enraged President Trump Canada does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much as ... income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the fact that I don't know and so if we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got in just had that we were mistreating their farmers\nMany American dairy farmers agreed with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently redefined some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada bark from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices\nPeople are also consuming less milk uh a lot of male cat in the past has been a dumped because it couldn't be processed and inappropriate time or sold an extreme discount Brian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the end\nRecent years it's not all because of Canada bark from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices people are also consuming less milk a lot of male cat\nIn the past has been a dumped because it couldn't be processed and inappropriate time or sold an extreme discount\nBrian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin well us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place ... says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture\nWe had no right to do that I I really think we're on thin ice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system\nGold says think of the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system the U. S. government sets a minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies us also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour\nCream for instance it's I think it's I don't remember exactly it's like\nGrand Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount the U.S sour cream tariff is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us tariffs on other cheeses and now you have like fifty percent terrorists Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important states the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole process\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada won't make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what happened is going to hurt us\nWhole process [noise]\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada make a dent in that\nYou know I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what was happening as dinner her a fear but it has no impact on their on their wellbeing it'll\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York farm or see things differently they're glad to have more access\nTo a Canadian markets still there is an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis Khalid on Ontario\nI'm this week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second ... entered the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul and it's not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what has happened to him\nSo I thought I thought of it is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new Jamal ... like him she lives outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on that area for the past few years have been put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi\nArabia and so Japan is the highest profile of something that's been going on inside tied to radio for more than a year now let's say and that's a scary thing\nIs also tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorists\nCritics of what's going on Saturday for the past few years have been put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and so Japan is the highest profile of something that's been going on inside Saudi Arabia for more than a year now let's say and that's the scary thing\nIs also tell us again what happened to you after you produce a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent journalism because there isn't anything called independent journalism and Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film there\nWere like how would you like to be identified argue Saudi dissidents like no I'm a journalist\nWas covering the story but because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can say these things we all become dissidents inadvertently\nAnd there was no other space and this is the problem with with with how the Saudi Government is dealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even the my oldest of comments and critique about their policies and so they've left no room for us\nThey've left no room for us to be able to properly cover stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman a came\nI Can't lose her absolutely on I ...

they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their own landing I Believe they're about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to do with the fact that there were\nNo longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start spinning and the ballistic re entry and then they're parachutes deployed to slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the earth or yeah they are [laughter]\nGod I've done what is known as a parabolic flight that's when you feel weightlessness for a moment to time and during the ... you experience extra genes and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress\nI didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\nAre there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if\nThey've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading\nSo as has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but Russia things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nNo us and Russia they're frequently an a specially these days when it comes to politics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight one is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics inter now it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that\nKind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has\nHad an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get and the way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not said Russia will let geopolitics getting away with that\nIs significant setback for the international space station\nWould say it's definitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts\nInto orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually they got up there and just the way as as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a few hundred or below day lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into that\nSo there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia\nAstronauts into orbit on the station and they are going to have to come home eventually they got up there and it's the way it is as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into that\nSo they are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down the road or Russia could possibly launch an empty Soyuz capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but that\nHasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren ... is senior science
