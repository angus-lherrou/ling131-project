[noise]\n\n\nLetting go is detailed in a series of articles in the Washington Post by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist ... low now has turned those articles into a book titled arising out of hatred please welcome ... [noise]\n\n\nYou know I Walk on the live wire thanks it's great to be here um how did you first meet this guy dark black\nSo I was writing about Dylann Roof for the Washington Post and Don roof it committed the hate crime murder of about a dozen people at a historically black church in Charleston South Carolina\nAnd Dylann Roof it's spent time on this website called storm front and which I had heard of but I didn't know very much about so and trying to understand the things that do in ... had been reading to sort of motivate him for this massacre I went on storm front and started reading this site it's\nThe largest racist website in the world and has been for two decades running\nAnd the biggest threat on this website there were plenty of people saying you know we're we celebrate towards things about Dylann Roof\nBut the biggest threat was about somebody named dark black and so I clicked on it and started to read and learned pretty quickly that Derrick whack was the rising air to not only this website but all sorts of this movement in the United states he was the son is the founder of this message board the godsend of David Duke he'd been raised\nAnd David Duke for those of you who fortunately I don't know who that is yeah you're lucky he's a former grand wizard of the KKK\nYeah exactly and he had sort of made this guy dark black his protege and Derek being really smart and ambitious had been disastrously successful in mainstreaming a lot of these terrible ideas he'd been elected to office by the time he was Twenty years old he had a daily\nLimited to what kind of office to a Republican committee seats and Florida and Florida yup\nWho fortunately don't know who that is yeah you're lucky is a former grand wizard of the KKK\nYeah exactly and he had sort of made this guy dark black his protege and Derek being really smart and ambitious had been disastrously successful in mainstreaming a lot of these terrible idea she'd been elected to office by the time he was Twenty years old\nHe had a date elected to what kind of office to a Republican committee seats and Florida and Florida yet\nIn West Palm Beach Florida which is a pretty diverse place\nUh let me ask you a little bit about this sort of storm front thing and how related to this movement between what a lot of people would call white supremacy or the idea of being a white supremacist and something called the white nationalism because\nI Would think those are the same thing but actually dark blacks dad was a big part of trying to move from white supremacy to white nationalism\nWhat's the difference\nSure that they've worked really hard to change the language of this movement to try to sanitize it from a history of bloodshed but I think the truth distinction that is helpful between white supremacy and white nationalism is\nWhite supremacy unfortunately is endemic to what the United States has been historically and is today and we're all still living in a country that was built unfortunately on a lot of white supremacist ideals white nationalist I think properly identifies\nA smaller group of people who are trying to separate races on two different continents as there and go\nBut like the idea to was that this guy dark black his father founded this website and it was trying to make kind of an intellectual argument like be this sort of thinking persons racist\nI mean he Derek father had also been the head of the clan for a decade in the United states and and eventually decided it was more effective to build a gigantic website and eventually to ban all slurs from that website there's no Nazi insignia\nNo racial slurs what they've tried to do is instead of speaking all the time horrible things about people's color\nBe the sort of thinking persons racist\nYeah I mean he Derek father had also been the head of the clan for a decade in the United states and and eventually decided it was more effective to build a gigantic website and eventually to ban all slurs from that website there's no Nazi insignia\nNo racial slurs what they've tried to do is instead of speaking all the time horrible things about people's color and Jews is instead they're trying to speak to unfortunately the fairly widespread and factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists in part of white America\nI'm this kid dark black and I just kind of a passive observer to this like his dad is starting this website and he is going into forums on the Internet and popularized in his words like white genocide and things like that when did he actually\nStart to realize that maybe this was not a good way to be living his life\nNot until he went to college and the ... in many ways had been indoctrinated with a lot of these ideas everybody who he lived with believe these things and had made it the costs for their lives and they pulled Derek out of the public schools\nAnd kept him sort of in the confines of white nationalism\nAnd that's where his childhood existed he was the keynote speaker at all these white nationalist conferences\nFrom the time he was ten years old so only in the first time that he got out of that world and began bumping into the people who are often the victims of his prejudices did any of his ideas begin to shift and that was when he was Twenty one years old went to the best college and the cheapest college in Florida\nAnd a true sign of the apocalypse I joined a gym this year um [noise] I don't know what I think is pretty unusual reason I joined because at the age of thirty two\nI was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder maybe soon I'll get my braces off get my period who know [noise] but I've been reading more about it you know when I'm short spurts\nAnd [noise] if it turns\nThe things that's supposed to really help with ADHD

but it was free so I went and I said listen here's what we're gonna do you're going to show me how to use these machines without blocking my head\nAnd then you and I are going to part ways for the rest of our lives and he said I totally get it but first we do need to do a questionnaire about your fitness goals and I was like oh I feel like it should be clear from that\nLike that sucks a\nBut it was free so I went and I said listen here's what we're gonna do you're going to show me how to use these machines without blocking my head\nAnd then you and I are going to part ways for the rest of our lives and he said I totally get it but first we do need to do a questionnaire about your fitness goals and I was like oh I feel like it should be clear from that last thing I said\nThat I Do not have fitness goal [laughter] my fitness goal was to join a gym and I did that already so I kind of feel like taking the rest of the year off if I'm being on a [noise]\nAnd he was like it's not that big a deal I just want you to tell me what it is you're hoping to\nGet out of this and I was like okay I guess I Would like to improve my posture my stamina\nMy general energy level and he goes okay great and your goal weight and I was like oh I'm not a political\n[noise]\nAnd he was like you don't want to lose weight and I was like no I Do not\nAnd he got this look on his face that told me that what he was thinking was but I can see here\nUm [noise]\nJoking and it's nothing against any of\nYou if you want to lose weight there's nothing wrong with that I think I used to want to do that when I was younger and then what happened was I gained forty pounds and then I started making a lot of money and having a lot of sex and\n[noise]\nThe weight is why that happened and I'm just saying I don't want to jinx it [noise]\nSo I don't want to lose weight and he goes looking in the mirror [noise]\nNothing you want to change\nAnd then I started making a lot of money and having a lot of sex and\n[noise]\nThe weight is why that happened and I'm just saying I don't want to jinx it [noise] so I don't want to lose\nWeight and he goes looking in the mirror [noise]\nThere's nothing you want to

lost weight would that be okay with you\n[noise] and at that\nPoint it was clear to me that he was not going to let me leave there until I admitted to him that I was flying from the Ghostbusters [noise] so I decided to throw 'em a bone I was like I'll give you this ever since I put on weight about a little bit more meat in my neck is made breathing a little bit harder than it used to be from certain positions when I'm lying down on the couch\nI guess if that improved I'd be fine with it [noise] and the oh my God you guys who were still really if he was just like okay so we want to lose some weight and he wrote it down and we couldn't move over isn't that crazy I'm Still so mad about it\nI'm mad at\nMe right because I missed an opportunity to just walk in there and be like oh yeah my
