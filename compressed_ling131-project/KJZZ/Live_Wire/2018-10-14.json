I had from like two years ago all of this and claimed income who am I going to like income that I had not told the the IRS I get emotional even thinking about it [laughter] and\nI did not want to deal with it nor did I Know how to deal with it and it was a substantial amount of money and I just had this ... and I took it into my office and I put it under something [laughter]\nThat was how I dealt with it and for like two or three days I was just walking around the house with this thing just crushing me with stress or my wife would go like you know I don't know if\nAnd I did not want to deal with it nor did I Know how to deal with it and it was a substantial amount of money oh my God and I just had this ... and I took it into my office and I put it under something [laughter]\nThat was how I dealt with it and for like\nTwo or three days I was just walking around the house with this thing just crushing me with stress uh my wife would go like you know I don't know if any of you do this but you'll have a really intense thought going on in your mind you're really worried and your partner will say what are you thinking about and for some reason you go nothing [laughter]\nI got to do wait on the world on me but I'm like oh no food so finally I had to tell her about it 'cause I didn't know what else to do\nAnd she looked at it and she was like oh no we we claimed all that that's a clerical error and then she just opened a spreadsheet on her laptop\nThat had all of it and all of the documentation oh my God she called them and they were like yeah that's our bad [noise]\nAnd then two thousand eleven you wrote a piece declaring yourself and letting the world know that you were not document\nAnd then in two thousand eleven you wrote a piece declaring yourself and letting the world know that you were not documented why on earth did you decide to do that seems like a terrible idea\nOf what is it twenty lawyers it was a terrible idea [laughter] um but you know the license was expiring the Portland\nDriver in order to get a driver's license was valid that was one of the year one kind of legitimizing ...\nAt a bar in the club and I freak the hell out because you know like how do you people forget like I'm undocumented because I don't have the right documents like how do you get around in America and post nine eleven America without any sort of ID\nIt was really the only piece of ID I had thanks to Oregon and it was expiring on February third two thousand eleven which was precisely may thirtieth birthday\nAnd so it was like miss tell tale heart kind of clock beating inside of me going like okay what are we going to do and at that point I was writing for the New Yorker I just finished my first documentary you know whatever I was living in your soda choices was I either self deport\nThanks to Mitt Romney for that phrase and actually my original plan was to leave because you know I haven't seen my mom since I was twelve um so I have a you know she sent me here I haven't seen her wow um she can't even coming a tourist visa because she doesn't own property she's not a college graduate tells you a lot about class and race\nOr I I stay and again I'm totally fine if I had to like be a janitor or babysit your kids are more your lawn and serve you drink like you know people expect us to do and find with doing that but\nI'm just I was twelve um so I haven't you know she sent me here I haven't seen her wow um she can't even coming a tourist visa because she doesn't own property should not a college graduate tells you about class and race\nOr I I ... and again I'm totally fine if I had to like be a janitor or ... babysit your kids are more your lawn and serve you drink like you know people expect us to do and find we're doing the opposite\nI ended up being a writer and really the only reason I became a journalist was so I could write my way into the newspaper\nBecause it was my way of physically feeling like I was here so I think the whole time I was just carrying a lot of guilt about how can I be in the business of truth telling if I'm lying about who I Am where you were going to carrying guilt or were you carrying\nUm anxiety or both I think it was and the way to compartmentalize that is you just you know thankfully I don't know how it happened and I I could have bought into drugs or alcohol lake but instead I'm just like I'm just going to work work work work work and you know you know people say that people like me should earn\nOr citizenship you mean people who are undocumented yeah like you know whenever they talk about immigration reform do like hey they should earn their citizenship so I actually convince myself but I have to do that which meant that I had to get this really you know good resume and then they realize like earning what have you done\nTo her citizenship [laughter] absolutely nothing [noise]\nI mean let's just kind of turned the tables around like if we were actually you know apparently it was a hundred and fifty thousand undocumented people in the state of Oregon if you were actually to compare what citizenship is I Would argue that undocumented people exhibited greater amount of citizenship then you could possibly imagine [noise]\n\nYou know I don't want to have to go around everybody in say like hey have you proving your worst\nWell apparently it was like a hundred and fifty thousand undocumented people in the state of Oregon if you were actually to compare what citizenship is I Would argue that undocumented people exhibit of greater amount of citizenship that you could possibly imagine [noise]\n\nAround everybody and say like hey have you proving your worst what have you done I don't want to do that that is ruled totally ruined [laughter] I don't want to do that and I just want us to be able to figure out how we can\nShare this base together and like what it means that\nOur lives you know we're accountable to each other\n\nWe're talking to Jose Antonio Vargas um that his book is deer America notes of an undocumented citizen I'm from the time when this was basically a secret that you were sort of keeping or at least not many people knew too when you publicly declared that you were undocumented\nUh how has your life changed our you less anxious now are you more anxious I mean certainly the current administration is probably not helping for you [laughter] but like what was it what's the difference in your life before and after you went public with this information\nOr the biggest thing is the moment I came out and documented I knew that I was only one story one story right and because I'm I looked like this people are going to project on to me this good immigrant model Maine or to stop doing that by the way it can we start projecting on Asian people this model minority thing what's your thought\nThat was going to happen so I started an organization called define American dot com please check it out and now employing people which is amazing\nBut just to check just how crazy our immigration system is so I can employ people and provide good health\nBenefits and insurance that I Can't get myself [noise] what kind of twisted isn't so\nI started his organization and then after Trump got elected president I was living in downtown\n... dot com please check it out and out employee Eighteen people which is amazing but just to check just how crazy our immigration system is so I can employ people and provide good health benefits\nAnd insurance that I Can't get myself [noise] what kind of twisted isn't so\nI started his organization and then after Trump got elected president I was living in downtown LA and the building manager texted me and said hey Jose um I don't know what we would do with ice showed up if we can protect you so when he said that it kind of crystallized for me\nWhat my own situation was that I Can't pretend that my life has been and always been in limbo so I packed everything up its own storage and I've been living I have another place since ... actually wrote the book while I was in hotel rooms and are being bees and friends' houses because\nI just kind of had to face what it means to be in this kind of ...\nWhat is the future look like for you I mean uh uh do you think you'll be able to live out your days in America or do you think it's it's a sort of a likelihood that you'll end up getting deported at some point\nI don't know I really don't know but I have to be prepared for everything the book just came out I did the today show I've been just going through the browns and what's fascinating is so many of my colleagues in journalism the number one thing they asked me after they read the book is\nI just don't understand why you can't fix this thing but before we talk about any sort of policy of politics can we get on the same page about what we're actually talking about right right\nI Want to think that is in your that is for example if I just counted all the undocumented Asian undocumented blocking documented white people what do we want to do with them and the rule now is what do each community each county each state really wants to do with us so there's only twelve states that allow us to drive\nAnd I'm Sorry to say to Oregon is no longer wanted them right so\nAbout what we're actually talking about right right\nI Want to think that is in your that is for example if I just counted all the undocumented Asian undocumented blocking documents are white people what do we want to do with them and the rule now is what each community each county each state really wants to do with us so there's only twelve states that allow us to drive and I'm Sorry to say to Oregon it's no longer wanted them\nRight so I I really don't know anymore what can happen in DC given how partisan and toxic it is what I Do know is every community has to decide who is welcome and how do they define American\nRight so our work is into that as a gay man I remember the time when Ellen was on the cover of time when will and grace is number one talk show on television right before we actually passed same sex marriage as a law\nThe culture in which we talk about gay people had to change it is now thankfully culturally unacceptable to be anti gay in this country you say something at the immigrant not only is it acceptable you get elected to be pressing the United states\nWhat is that about right\nWhat's one thing somebody is listening to this interview right now out wherever they are in America who might want to try to change the way that we talk about this and the way we think about what's one thing somebody can do\nHas to start would you meaning how willing or are you to be uncomfortable talking to you own relatives about this are you going to call your coworker out who says something bad about him he goes right leg I define American we strongly believe in the gift of uncomfortable conversations\nThat's mostly what the show is great [noise] but for me if you are not uncomfortable talking about this with someone else and you're actually not doing it right to me so get comfortable with the discomfort of having real conversation about what happens\nIs is right and that's why I think this book is going to really help because it's a clear deliberate two hundred page play by play\n... that's mostly what the show is great but for me if you are not uncomfortable talking about this with someone else and you're actually not doing it ... dream\nJob get comfortable with the discomfort of having real conversation about what happened\nIs is right and that's why I think this book is going to really help because it's a clear deliberate two hundred page play by play of what it actually means to be this kind of abstract term I think in in the minds of a lot of people that live in this country it's just kind of\nBlank place holder word like immigration reform or illegal but now here's a story with a beginning middle and I hope\nA the kind of and that we all want for you that I think can can make that change with a relative or a community or community member or a school if they could take a look at the book Oh thank you\nThat's the hope but you know look I Love this country if I did and I would have already left I Love all the teachers that ever welcome ear I Love\nI Love that I'm from Mountain View California I loved it you know this is a country that always tries to figure out how to better itself um and I think we have to remind people that it is actually a choice for us to stay right we choose to stay the question is what is your choice what are you gonna do\nJose Antonio Vargas everyone\n[laughter] document [noise]\nRight Jose we we couldn't let you leave quite yet are we are talking this week on the show about fishing our fears and uh as you mentioned and as we were doing some research on your we learn that a fear that you have is going to therapy or you apparently told NPR that you've never been to therapy before because you've always\n[noise]\nAll right Jose we we couldn't let you leave quite yet uh we're talking this week on the show about facing our fears\nAnd as you mentioned and as we were doing some research on you we learned that they fear that you have is going to therapy or you apparently told NPR that you've never been to therapy before\nBecause you've always been a little bit scared of it because you watch Frasier as a kid [laughter] and so we were hoping that we could sort of help tackle your fear of therapy and\nWhatever residual Frasier related ... do you have like giving you a little quiz about those topics the segment that we like to call let's get quiz ...\n\nYou know [noise]\n\nSo here's the thing that is going to work because they are we're going to give you a quote and you have to tell us if it's advice from the fictional Dr Frasier Crane or a real close from an eminent therapist [laughter]\nWell well\nCourtney welcome back to the live wire thank you where it all\nFeel to be on that side of the hosting experience I eat how does it feel to be a guest on this show\nIt is completely bizarre it really but I have\nSay hey I watched people for nine years you know well for twelve years right sit over in the guest area of the audience and wonder what that experience must be like and it's been great\nI feel comfortable asking you this because uh you ... you write about it\nCan you take me back\nFateful weekend when you were the host of this show yeah and I was scheduled to be a guest on this show yeah and you decided not today said [laughter]\n[laughter] right well and I I didn't think I would've done hosting the show I just knew that I was having a massive today panic attack and then I couldn't\nDo it and I mean I had I been hosting for nine years at that point and\nYour guest mhm on the show yeah and you decided not today said [laughter]\n[laughter] right well and I didn't think it was done hosting the show I just knew that I was having a massive today panic attack and that I couldn't\nDo it and I mean I had I been hosting for nine years at that point and\nAnd I had never canceled a show um my wonderfully supportive rather\nI called him and he just kept saying you've got to cancel you have to cancel and I said oh there's all these people they're counting on me and and there's the whole staff and the audience and my brother is um he's a very straightforward person and he's a very kind person\nBut at the time it was just he looked at me he had this look on his face that said it is so adorable that you think you're that important\n[laughter] he just looked at me and you know when people when someone tips their head and looks at you and that's what he did he put a blind or heart aches\nBless your sweet little heart\nThe world is not going to stop turning Collier producer and\nWhat was what was extraordinary about that moment as you well know was the you were going to be on the show the next day and the whole reason we were having you on was that you were this guy who was a podcast host\nAnd we thought you could fill in for me if I ever got sick and I honestly think that part of what happened with my brain going this is your chance this is your chance to get out of the situation\nI I [laughter] I I\nEighty four for a number of years I'd had panic attacks on stage and I had what I called my dread ball for every show and it was an untenable situation and I called Robin ... is our producer at the time and I said yeah amazing Robin and I called her with a problem and\nIs your chance to get out of the situation\nI I [laughter] I I\nThe things I eighty four for a number of years I'd had panic attacks on stage and I had what I called my dread ball for every show and it was an untenable situation and I called Robin ... is our producer at the time and I said yeah amazing Robin\nAnd I called her with a problem and a solution and I said I Can't hosted let's ask loop to do it but what I didn't know was that you weren't a massive bender that night [laughter]\nThe night before the show which meant that morning of the show I was massively hung over\nOf those things from like a like an old like Bob Hope movie\nOf the person wakes up and they see three of everything [noise]\nOf those mornings and what I was looking at it was my cell phone and there was just a lot of missed calls from Portland\nYeah yeah you were Bob Hope drunk yes um you know and I've I've been on book tour and I've been telling the story and what I always say to people was you hosted that night and I already written the whole script right like everything was done and you hosted that night\nAnd what I said to do when I say to people is\nSomething happened that was wonderful and horrible and that is that the show was great and it was fine and Luke was fantastic\nAnd so I realize that this thing that I had helped make could totally survive without me and that's great news and it's terrible news\nYou know it's the whole reason that I did when we\nYeah you know so I always thought that the show is\nThe thing that made me maybe the only thing that may be interesting right because I didn't have a great self image and then this other thing is when everyone thinks you're really lucky it takes you a really long time to realize how miserable you are\nAnd that's great news and it's terrible news you know it's the whole reason that I did when we\nYou know so I always thought that the show is the thing that made me maybe the only thing that may be interesting right because I didn't have a great self image and then this other thing is when everyone thinks you're really lucky it takes you a really long time to realize how miserable you are\nI'm Talking to coordinate ... writer extraordinarily\nRadio her job\n\nYou described her personality is high and eroticism and blow in extra version which seems a like a bad fit for you or you know you've done stuff on stage of amazing singing voice you posted this show you're like how do you square those two parts of your personality\nUm it's very difficult I mean I I struggle with neurotic system obviously but I also struggle with you know I started with a negative self image for a really long time and so when I realized with the audience for this thing that causes me so much anxiety but at the same time\nHearing their applause and their laughter was proof that I was an okay person you know and and I think that when I lost the hosting gig and I realized ... one of the things that I lost was just all of these people who\nMistakenly would sort of gives me credit for them having a great time for three hours on a Saturday Night you know and somehow it was like that means that I'm worthy of something and you cannot get your self worth\nFrom four hundred drunk people that the terrible idea\nI'm going to do my damn just to see if I can make that All right\nSo you you you start writing this column and you started this really active process of of sort of taking on projects that were scary do you are pushed your comfort level or your boundaries and you wrote about it and there's like adventures\nEarth from four hundred drunk people that the whole idea of\nI'm going to do my damn just to see if I can make that case\nSo you you you start writing this column and you started this really active process of of sort of taking on projects that were scared you are pushed your comfort level or your boundaries\nAnd you wrote about it and there's like adventures are kind of amazing when did you feel most out of your element in all these different things that you took on cuddling Pauli Amory drugs you name it\nI Would say I was most uncomfortable going to the professional Cutler my imagining that was by far the most difficult thing for\nMe and can you explain the professional color I mean it's sort of right there in the title yes but for folks that are familiar with what what ... what does this woman to address\nTheir name is Samantha house and she has a business called cuddle up to me and you pay a dollar a minute to cuddle her um she had a business out of her house for a long time but she was so successful that she opened up a storefront here in Portland\nAnd she is fifty six different positions that you can choose from but she really sort of as an impasse and kind of decide what you need\nAnd what it's like why was that one of the things that was really scary for you\nFor me I'm afraid to talk to strangers I don't like talking to strangers I never approach people in public\nUm and so for me the idea of than cuddling with a stranger is far far worse but another reason that gave me a lot of trepidation was that I saw the the the ocean of snark that came at her when she got a lot of media attention and I thought that people said things like that is pathetic\nAnd you know are just terrible things about the people who needed her\nAnd the thing was I have been single the majority of my adult life and I really like a decade where\nIt was that I saw the the the ocean of snark that came at her when she got a lot of media attention and I thought that people said things like that's pathetic and you know are just terrible things about the people who needed her\nAnd the thing was I have been single the majority of my adult life\nAnd I'd I'd really like a decade where\nPeople weren't touching me and people who get touched on a regular basis they don't understand what it feels like\nTo knock it touched and what it does to your self image you start to believe that you don't deserve to be touched or loved and that feeling is so vulnerable\nAnd and so what gave me trepidation about it was it I related to the people who needed her so there was so much bound up and going to see her and you know so many so much fear and she immediately put me as much as ... as I could have been when\nMy entire body was a two by four you know like I so I turned into maybe a piece of on cook spaghetti instead of you know yeah but we huddled for a while then she had me do these African nations and wish I hate affirmation I hate them so much but but the one\nThing she made me say you know I'm enough I'm amazing which I Know I Know it's ... and I was fine with it I was like this is fine I Am enough right now uh I haven't paid my taxes for twenty twelve but that's not a big deal I'm\nPart of the job of being the host of the show is tax problem [laughter]\nWhen you're talking about I was like a been there\nAnd you know and I'm amazing and I'm like\nAmazing I did this number scared\nBut then she got to I'm beautiful and I started crying and I realized oh that's the point of affirmation is to not necessarily point you to the things that you want to believe but\nOh I'm part of the job of being the host of the show as tax problem [laughter]\nWhen you're talking about that I was like a been there and you know and I'm amazing and I'm like\nThe main thing I did this number scared\nBut then she got to I'm beautiful and I started crying and I realized oh that's the point of affirmation it's not necessarily point you to the things that you want to believe but point out that things that you know you don't believe by yourself because you can't say though\nWe got to take a short break we're talking to Courtney ... her book is okay fine whatever the year I went from being afraid of\nEverything strongly being afraid of most things this is my boy already over here I\n\nYou're listening to live wire on gay Jay's easy kj is easy and supported by Tempe Center for the
