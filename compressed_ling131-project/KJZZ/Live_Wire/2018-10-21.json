week I Know I certainly have a for reasons that I Am about to explain from the stage of the Alberta rose theater in Portland or take a listen to this [noise]\n\nIf I seem a little\nCalmer a little more at peace a little more centered than normal\nStanding up here it's not an accident people I recently started meditating and it is changing my life\nTechnically I have not officially started the meditation\n[noise] but I downloaded a meditation apt to my phone [noise]\nWhich as you know is the hardest part about meditating I Believe the Dalai Lama\nSaid that I'd like to tell you that\nLife

said that I'd like to tell you that\nThis is the first meditation apple pie of downloaded to my phone I'd like to tell you that but it is not true [noise]\nHave a folder on my phone that is just basically like the enlightenment and graveyard\nIt is full of meditation apps and breathing apps and various things like that that I have downloaded\nAnd never even opened\n'cause I like to hear about it or I I read about it on slate and I'm like this is the one that is going to change my life and then I downloaded and then it doesn't really changed my life even though I have been on this journey pretty much my entire life to try to find\nThe thing whatever it is it's going to actually make me feel some sense of inner peace and happiness like even when I was a kid when I was ten years old this was my little ritual I Would do my chores on a Saturday or getting my allowance which was two bucks\nI Would ride my bike to the Jack in the box near our house and I would get a jumbo jak for Ninety nine cents and I would get some fries with the rest of the money on side bar that was about Thirty years ago and three decades later he going price for a jumbo jak\nHovers around Ninety nine cent still [noise]\nWhich seems like a big red flag [noise]\nIn the box near our house and I would get a jumbo jak for Ninety nine cents and I would get some fries with the rest of the money on side bar

little food and I'd ride my bike home and I would sit on my bed which is all made in my little room that was all clean from doing my chores and I would get the food set up no take out the first French fry and I didn't catch up and they'll bite into it\nAnd in the moment that I was biting into that French fry I Would feel a total sense of calm [noise]\nWould last for upwards of Fifteen seconds because then it was time to start thinking about the next thing whatever that was an even do intellectually even then I understood that this idea of having to have everything perfect even though I knew that was not like\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nTo live wire radio from the are Irish murderous theater this week [noise]\nMy name's Luke Burbank I'm your host we are here with George Saunders his latest book is Lincoln in the bar do this book is about Abraham Lincoln son willy who passes away and he's in\nThe bar do which is a sort of a limbo I guess of sorts and a ... you said you had the idea for many years ago but then you started working on in earnest for about four years or so when did you realize you really have something\nYou know there's in the book one of the things I did was I quoted from historical sources verbatim plagiarized enormous or is that it was an amazing part of the book yeah\nAnd so there was just an afternoon where I Am typed up all these historical sources cut them up with scissors was on the floor arranging it kind of feel like I'm just avoiding writing this if this was an elaborate through doing a collage yeah [laughter] and then at one point it described his party that the Lincolns had and\nIt was kind of this party that sent the sun into that\nDon't know it was like plagiarized enormous of is that it was an amazing part of the book yeah\nAnd so there was just an afternoon where I I had tightened up all these historical sources cut them up with scissors was on the floor arranging it kind of feeling like I'm just avoiding writing this is this is an elaborate ... doing a collage that's right yeah and then at one point it was described his party that the Lincoln's head and\nIt was kind of this party that sent the sun and to the death spiral 'cause it's a very loud party and the White House\nSo um I was renting these bits and suddenly this magical thing happened every writer craves which is it stopped being writing and it started being event\nIt just it just felt wow that party has happened in front of my eyes so it's kind of the realization that even that we're seeing that had nothing to do with me typing new tax was part of my uh attempt to emotionally moved to the the audience\nAnd then I thought oh this is really weird and actually it's there's a great feeling like you're being a little naughty\nOr someone's going to really hate us you know and and that's actually the feeling you want because if you can convert that person who says that's just punch this fake news you know or whatever is that\nIf you can blow away [laughter] we're trying to create a safe space for these people\nBut if you forty five minute timeout on those terms if you can\nConvert the skeptic then then you're really an intimate communication with your readers\nUm you obviously had to do a ton of research about about Lincoln as well and about the time um did you find out stuff about Abraham Lincoln that you had not previously no\nYeah I just fell in love with them I mean he's the one thing was that he was actually even though he was known as being ugly he was incredibly attractive to women\nWomen will always know really really drawn to him very kind very tall kind of powerful guy and he he loves his wife so much so one of the ways he self gamed was to deflect his attention from young women he had a whole system of kind of\nYou know turning away from them in the name of not aggravating Mary you're not making your own happy so I thought that was kinda cool where do you find out\nEven though he was known as being ugly use incredibly attractive to women women all we know really really drawn to him very kind very tall kind of powerful guy and he he loves his wife so much so one of the ways he self gamed was to deflect his attention from young women he had a whole system of kind of\nYou know turning away from them in the name of not aggravating married not making your own happy so I thought that was kind of cool where do you find out something like that has made it up\nYou know yeah I Know the [noise] I Know that sort of lettuce or you are a master of George Saunders\nBut also you know the thing is I I I came to love about him I said here's a guy who's you know a ... he has no he's in the last four years of his life making incredible progress ... learning new stuff everyday killing tens of thousands of young men with his mistakes you know\nAnd if you track those last three years he's somebody who just kept opening up an opening up and I think his I mean this is my interpretation but I think his eagle just really shrunk and he became so involved in trying to bring benefit for everybody else that I Am in Buddhism I ... and if somebody who's a initially very large ego\nIn in the face of this pain kind of shrunk and a sort of watch them at the end having realizations about race that we're still not quite you know we still haven't really internalize was kind of really moving you know\nWould you say that stands in contrast to the current president [noise]\n\nWhen you when you go on a wicked Peter under softball question that's going to\nUp well I actually I I Do want to talk a little bit about that world with you because you wrote a piece back in June of twenty sixteen or at least that was when it was published in the New Yorker\nA windy presidential campaign was still in full swing and I still think it was probably for me maybe one of them are illuminating things about the the sort of rise of Donald Trump you went on the campaign trail and just talk to people at his various rallies um did that then to make you less\nBut a little bit about that world with you because you wrote a piece back in June of twenty sixteen or at least that was it was published in the New Yorker\nI win the presidential campaign was still in full swing and I still think it was probably for me maybe one of them are illuminating things about the the sort of rise of Donald Trump\nYou went on the campaign trail and just talk to people at his various rallies um did that then to make you less surprised than the rest of us when he actually won\nOr were you a shock to know why we were really shocked I I went before he was nominated and it'll alarming because mainly because of the extent to which I couldn't communicate with his supporters nice people we had a good time it was like a like a Jimmy Buffett concert helped music you know it's just [noise] but then\n[noise]\nBut when you get right down to it we we write each other but we didn't persuade each other so I've I've come to think that when you look at Lincoln\nYou you really learn what we all know which is to be a human being as you get older the goal is to get more loving\nLess sure of yourself more comfortable of ambiguity more generous you know Lincoln did the current administration it seems locked in this kind of incompetent mode of fearful mess and distrust and that's really weird is really not what we're about as a country except\nSome thirty eight percent think it is so alarming you know and as an artist I think if you step towards everything with sympathy as your first move you actually get more information\nYou know and then when you get more information you're actually a better adversary if you have to be one so I I think is actually a time when people who are open minded in large hard it can do both things resist furiously and a love uncontrollably and that's actually where we're going to get out of this mess [noise]\n\nWell now it's time for me to turn the audience against you\nYou want to so I I think is actually a time when people who are open minded in large hard it can do both things resist furiously and a local uncontrollably and that's actually where we're going to get out of this man [noise]\n\nOh well now it's time for me to turn the audience against you\nWere talking of George Saunders now you you got your graduate degree in and literature when you were I think around thirty but before that you actually graduated from the Colorado School of mines and worked in oil exploration I did yeah guys\n[noise]\nWhen did you when it's mine's moms oh they have got to get a bigger sign 'cause that is so confusing in the fact that the two schools are next to each other very\nWhen when did you sort of realized that you are not the you know oil exploration was not for you and were you in your heart a sort of writer at that time to just doing something you thought was maybe a a job that you could make a living and\nI I kind of realize that the first week of classes because I I had been a really bad student in Chicago wasn't going to go to college and had these two teachers Linda Holmes who intervened and actually called the school and got me and so and I love them so much and I when I got there I realized that uh\nI had to not flunk out because of I flunked out of there I was going to go back to the starting line in Chicago and you know ... circle the bowl so even though I could feel I wasn't good at it I tell you this is a real turning point you got to stick it out so I did and then it went to Asia I worked in the oil fields and actually it was okay and I was writing a little\nAnd then uh I had a thing right I was trying to do a Hemingway thing so I went swimming in a smarter and river after some drinking and what and with no clothes just like you know that thing that'll sure uh but then I was swimming in it there's a an oil pipeline along the river and on the river there like four hundred monkeys\nSo I did and then it went to Asia I worked in the oil fields and I'm actually it was okay and I was writing a little\nAnd then uh I had a thing right I was trying to do a Hemingway thing so I went swimming in Sumatra river after some drinking and with and with no clothes just like you know that thing that'll sure are [laughter] ah but then I was swimming in it there's a an oil pipeline along the river and on the river there like four hundred monkeys\nAnd I'm dog paddling there and I see them there are pumping into the water you know [noise]\nI'm like how I Wonder if that's okay [noise] wasn't really gotten deathly ill for about three years uh gave up the job and came home and started writing so\nSo loud [noise] that is not what I expected that story to be going [noise] so this is what I\nTell my students you know swimming approve the river and you'll know [laughter]\nWell yeah you you you teach\nYou teach in the M. F. a program in Syracuse um and and I wanted to get your sort of take on on the state of things there are one is there a particular piece of writing advice that you find yourself giving to your students like more than any other piece of advice\nYeah so what I Try to tell them is that there's actually this whole beautiful thing called revision like radical revision that if you're trying to find your voice is your best friend you you aren't necessarily your totality when you just talk you know if if we both stand up there and just talk\nIt there's some indication if we are but when you go back and start trimming that talk and cutting it down to its essence that's another way that you can you can weigh in so to me there there's a great line um I think Robert Frost said this at a public talk some student ask them a complicated question about this on it and he said\nYoung man don't worry work\nAs Reagan now I tell a story and then was a process expert pull me aside of the readings that he didn't say that he said he said he said don't\nWorry [laughter] [noise]\nIt was essence that's another way that you can you can weigh in so to me there there's a great line um I think Robert Frost said this at a public talk some student ask them a complicated question about this on it and he said\nYoung man don't worry work\nThat's where you can tell that story and then was a process expert pull me aside of the readings that he didn't say that he said he said he said don't worry [laughter]\n[noise] I like it better the way you have and so yeah yeah do you feel encouraged\nAbout ... you know next generation of writers I mean are they doing things differently than than than your generation can conceive of because of the way that they've communicated with each other because of age you you feel a little\nBit of that but what what the best thing about my job as every fall and we meet a new group of young people and it just makes you realize that that ... talent is eternal it as an old person you you will get into that mode where if if you're you know if your mind is a stranger it tends to tighten over time you know the\n[noise]\nIs that a result of the monkey river that happened to you because of that [laughter]\nBut when you but when you see these young people are like you know if I think if I ever find myself saying these kids today it's just my mind being stupid you know so I Am so cheered by by senior been traveling around the country\nTo that generation the young generation now is unbelievably uh compared to what I was on obstructed and loving and I'm very hopeful about the future [noise]\nBecause that's what my mom would do watch\nPeople and when your age you like what [laughter]\nBut now I'm older like we would go for mystery rides and you don't have a lot of money you y'all hop in the Chevy that blows purple smoke when the ...
