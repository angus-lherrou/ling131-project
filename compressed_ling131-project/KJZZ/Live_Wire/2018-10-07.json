live wire radio from PR I were to take a short break and then come back and talk about the the opposite state of affairs the dinner party stay with us is why why in\nThe news\nAnd you're listening to

dot org\n\nWelcome back to live wire from P R I read the\n\nWelcome back to live wire from P. R. I. repeal burger rose theater in Portland this week our team is on the contrary and we are talking to rented Francis knew them and ... and other from the dinner party download radio show and podcast as well as her new book brunch is how\nOn this book is sort of a a criticism of brunch but really it's a celebration of dinner parties thank you um what are the what are the are the keys to throwing a good dinner party you whether you want it to or not you've kind of become the national expert on this topic because of your radio show in ...\nWell we wrote the book on it no literally wrote the book on it well I mean the first real dinner parties is right there in the title is to have dinner and the party yeah that's it\nNow that seems deceptively simple the point is there should be no agenda at a dinner party you can have a boss at a dinner party you can't be setting up people at a dinner party a holiday party isn't a dinner party because there's an agenda there a dinner party is really we considered recess for adults this is a place which is made up of less than twenty five percent of your family because with [laughter]\nWith more than that there's an agenda taking place uh we we face suggest\nMore than that my mom's in the corner yelling that Tim Allen about about friends right so if we save save that for him\nOr ask for Thanksgiving and I go to separate thing um and so that's the rule number one is to have people in your home and ask them for nothing and just feed them most of our lives we have to be a where employees were employers were in control where soccer coaches were doing all this stuff but this was the one place where you can let that go so those are the like the the basics\nWhat now what elevates dinner party from just meeting the minimum definition\nRight so if we save save that for the un morass for Thanksgiving and I go to separate thing\nUm and so that's the rule number one is to have people in your home and asked them for nothing and just feed them um most of our lives we have to be a where employees were employers were in control or soccer coaches were doing all this stuff but this is the one place where you can let that go so those are the like the the\nBasics what now what elevates dinner party from just meeting the minimum definition of a dinner party to being actually a good dinner party\nOh well I mean a lot of things come conversation would be a great thing to have\nWhat you're trying to do is get stories out of people and we it's fascinating we actually have a quote from Alan Alda about people who actually wrote a book about sort of the way people share information\nAnd industry when people tell stories their minds literally sync up like their their brains to light up in certain ways so that it's almost like her mind melding with people so if you can get people to tell interesting stories you're actually sort of creating community and getting everybody literally on the same wavelength\nSo why do you think that the dinner party has declined in in ... maybe not popularity in people's minds but certainly in frequencies\nYeah I think the rise of ... them as maybe even more interested in cooking but also made people uncomfortable to cook and invite people into their homes or we suggest that only fifty one percent of the food needs to be made it home you need over just fifty one percent just over the finish line there to make it a reflection of you and needs to be your food\nUh that's one thing the vents who I think people are I mean we're in Portland we wrote this from New York and LA our ... our apartment they're small and I think people are afraid to bring people into their homes they feel like it needs to be perfect I think that's\nA present things idea and I think that people have been allowed into this false sense of security that brunch and restaurants are really going to bring them full joy I got a couple of quick\nHere um music at a dinner party or I Am one of those people who will spend a day putting together like a six hour play list that I Want to just like crescendo\nAfraid to bring people into their homes they feel like it needs to be perfect I think that's a present things id and I think that people have been lulled into this false sense of security that\nBrunch and restaurants are really going to bring them full joy I got a couple of quick questions here um music at a dinner party\nOr I Am one of those people who will spend a day putting together like a six hour play list that I Want to just like Christian do with the scissors sisters cover of comfortably numb right is everyone's getting a little buzz yeah and then someone else wants to plug in their iPod\nAnd because they have jock jams on there or something is are you a bad to host if you kind of rule your stereo within with an iron fist at your own dinner party absolutely not getting that it's a musical dictatorship I absolutely\nFor either urine controller you have any control over to one other person otherwise it's an absolute free for all you know one moment you're listening to fly in the family stone another moment you're listening to ... which could be fun for the after party but not for the meal itself so you need to take control and I think you were wise to create a playlist beforehand and you can just set it and forget it what\nAbout children at a dinner party yours or your friends willing to bring them there was an actual grown of\nThis [noise] and how dare they\nUh we we do we have said as we said before dinner parties a recess for adults who are not adults children but\nBut it is very important first of all we looked at it and it is important too to an end culture rate them to the pleasures of the form of the dinner party\nI'm Glad to hear you say that Rico because even though I'm On one level it feels like it's for the adults maybe it's a little bit less fun if there's kids there I remember being a kid\nAt like dinner parties are for me it was like a lot of weird church potluck and prayer meetings but what you were a kid and you get to be around adults and observe them in their environment if you're a certain kind of get who's kind of kid I was that was like ...\nTo the pleasures of the form of the dinner party\nI'm Glad to hear you say that Rico because even though on on one level it feels like it's for the adults maybe it's a little bit less fun if there's kids there I remember being a kid\nAt like dinner parties are for me it was like a lot of weird church potluck and prayer meetings ... where you're a kid and you get to be around adults and observe them in their environment if you're a certain kind of get who's kind of get out what that was like everything to me\nAbsolutely but but and so the the catches here that they should be old enough that they can take care of themselves so that they can observe from afar the adults can have our time and the kids can have so the kids need to be just old enough that they can entertain themselves without setting themselves on fire\nOr ... and like going to the bathroom and they have to be able to hold their liquor [laughter]\nAt your hardest problem\nObviously the book is brunch is hell rented Francis knew them Enrico galley auto everybody [noise]\nAlright Rico and Brendan your new book brunch as hell points out or what you guys see as the sort of drawbacks of the brunch vacation of our culture on but what you don't really get into very much or the caloric repercussions of brushing it on the rag [noise]\nAh here's what we have done we have done some research on popular restaurant brunch is and how many calories those breakfast and brunch is contained we're going to give you a caloric number because you're the brunch expert ... you have to guess\nIf that is over or under the actual calories in these breakfast ... calling it caloric over under the\nCouch counts [laughter] how we view of the day you get the amount game um\nAnd branches contain we're going to give you a caloric number 'cause you're the brunch expert traitors you have to guess if that is over or under the actual calories in these breakfast ... calling it caloric over under\n... pounds ... pounds we view of the day and you get the mound game\nIt's like schoolhouse rock schoolhouse became gentrified and turned into a restaurant\nAmazing okay so this is a\nPretty simple game I'm going to give you a caloric amount and you just have to try to decide and you've got to come to a consensus on this um that as the as the the authors of branches hell if you think it's over or under the Denny's grand slam okay one thousand calories over or under that's more\nOr I have no idea calories ... like I don't really think about ...\nI'm Sorry for like ... I don't even know infringing on their back away right\nI'll say is it sounds higher than than a grand slam no I'm saying it's way too low for Grassley so Rico your opinion is a grand slam as more than a thousand calories ran in your opinion\nIs that it has less than a thousand calories sure okay I Will say that Rico's a hundred percent\nRight and Brenda you were a hundred percent Ron yeah it is one thousand one hundred and eight calories fifty three point five grams of fat right\nHow about the jumbo Rudy Judy freshman fruity from I hop over or under Thirteen hundred calories\nRudy sounds healthy yes it does how sausage bacon enhanced compost and pancakes so the compost the vegetable yeah I've never\nOne thousand one hundred and eight calories fifty three point five grams of fat right\nHow about the jumbo Rudy Judy freshman fruity from I hop over or under Thirteen hundred calories\nRudy sounds healthy yes darling it says how sausage bacon enhanced compost and pancakes so the compost the vegetable yeah ... yeah that sounds how the protein I'm going to say it's under\nUnder Thirteen hundred calories that is Brent in France as soon as official answer ... or the ingredients you just said real has come out and\nThey meet ... no no no the the fruit component\nBut with bacon and ... oh yeah you get some breakfast meats and they're doing they're making their sausage there's also ham I still I then I say that is again too low it's got to be more more calories than that and once again I'm going to say branch\nSean ... yeah it has more than Thirteen hundred calories is over it has fourteen hundred calorie and my God if you are looking for the diet choice the regular Rudy duty comes in at ... eight hundred and forty calories how about the garbage plate\nA regional delicacy in Rochester New York one of the many places you can buy their new wrenches hell yeah\n'em in the Ted Talk is that you had this you won this contest you won the chance to go to New York and to meet with all of these incredibly powerful literary agents and publishing houses right and all this stuff and it was really happening for you and yet\nIt took you ten years more before you actually followed up when these people who are more or less begging you to to be able to represent you or to get some pages from you what happened in those ten years\nWell and the opportunities came to me I was in my twenties like twenty five and one this big writing prize and I got to go to New York and meet all these amazing agents and editors and so it was kind of being offered to me on a beautiful plate\nBut where I was in my life was in a place where all I felt was a sad\nQuiet stone my throat and I couldn't accept any of the offers and it was right there in front of me and and the thing I Know now almost twenty twenty five years later is that for some of us saying yes or accepting what's in front of you isn't easy\nBecause we don't believe we deserve it\nAnd it could take us years like for me\nQuiet stone my throat and I couldn't accept any of the offers and it was right there in front of me and and the thing I Know now almost twenty twenty five years later is that for some of us saying yes or accepting what's in front of you isn't easy\nBecause we don't believe we deserve it\nAnd it could take us years like for me it took ten to Twenty years for me to stand up inside the thing that was being handed Jimmy front of me and just say you know I might I might be able to stand up inside this too\nAnd so I'm kinda here to remind any of the rest of you that uh we all deserve a place at the table and it doesn't matter what shape it takes and we're not all going to look like celebrity culture\nAnd that's a its own kind of beauty the weird kind of been did stars still shining the sky so I'm here for you [noise]\n\nIf you start or religion I Am signing on [laughter] I Want to be the first ... here in the church of Lydia ... thank you so much for being on live wire [noise]\n\n\nLive wire is Roger you buy Alaska Airlines an airline that doesn't just lie lumberjacks to ... with twelve hundred daily flights in over one hundred Fifteen destination than the U.S\nCanada Mexico and Costa Rica in Alaska Airlines flies all kinds of books all kinds of places and if you're a lumberjack who needs to get into a glacier\n[noise] live wire is brought you buy Alaska Airlines an airline that doesn't just lie lumberjacks into ... with twelve hundred daily flights in over one hundred Fifteen destinations in the U.S\nCanada Mexico in Costa Rica ...
