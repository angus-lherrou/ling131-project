minds these last three weeks of the the Kavanaugh hearings the\nPresident's a campaign rallies constant campaign rallies developments at the border crisis with Saudi Arabia\nCan we say whether any of those seem to be shifting the playing field\nThey are not there might have been a kind of cabinet bump but the most important thing to remember about these last two weeks in the election is that the fundamentals haven't changed much at all the house still looks pretty good for Democrats not sure if it's good enough for them to get the net twenty three\nPick up seats that they need which they don't they need Senate map looks excellent for Republicans that always has that's because there are a lot of\nSenate Democratic incumbents in very red states where Donald Trump is very popular we know the Democrats are more energized this year Republicans are becoming more energized as they always do in October we're also seeing signs that they we might have a very high turnout mid term election which is pretty rare\nUh people are self reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting we've seen record turnouts in primaries and special election in\nWhich the closing argument that both parties are settling on\nWell the closing argument from Republicans who began thinking that the tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular they're closing argument is now warning voters that Democrats will take away the tax cuts\nPut regulations back on the economy wrecked the economy there kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues which do energize their base talking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people and I'm looking at a fundraising pitch from me\nBooming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular

issues which do energize their base talking about hordes of criminal illegal aliens coming to kill people and I'm looking at a fundraising pitch\nFrom Mimi Walters Republican congresswoman from California who says we just learned that my socialist pro tax opponent out raised us\nWe can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress\nHow Democrats on the other hand have stuck to health care which is the number one issue for voters this year except for their refining a little bit they're now saying Republicans gave tax cuts to the rich created a huge deficit and to close that whole they are going to come and cut your Medicare and Social Security [noise]\nMay I ask you the flip side of a closing argument question which is what's the biggest challenge for each party at this point what what's keeping Republicans up at night what's keeping Democrats up at night as election day closer than Republicans are worried about the mid west this is the the area of the country where Trump really one Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nThey thought those states would turn red they thought oh Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling in the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so they're worried about exciting their base in the industrial heartland\nA Trump and another problem for Republicans is the Trump kept telling his supporters there's a red wave and borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that's the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually loses big when the president is\nAnother problem for Republicans as the Trump kept telling his supporters there's a red wave and the borders believed him and got a little complacent and we

but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when the president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nRight NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you [laughter]\nNow for all the focus on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally\nIf Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district it is a deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams\nOr in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator note that well other Democrats debate the tactics of

sides he's got no choice Republicans had a Thirteen point advantage in this district the votes I Need\nTo win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman\nWho got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly what I'm working with I build\n... relationship on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nShe was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation\nThat stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nAnd it's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that\nOr to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I tried to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence and Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like the Adams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates ships party dynamics

Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona\nPresident Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now\nBoth US Senators the

Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this\nThere's the governor most state lawmakers they are all Republican but that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state\nAnd to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino\n[noise]\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could uh give the Republicans some\nOf the way we handle our home especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump

truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news they're coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party if you ask me I mean who's ordering all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJust ... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding the district state representative Tony Rivera [noise] have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what do they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all\nWouldn't be in the district at state representative Tony Rivera\nHave any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their as district attorney knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was telling you there on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do a paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen they know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in ... parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask for their own if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a\nI asked her narrow if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and when you increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is what I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of or soda I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug ... on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you were approached do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nFor the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of
