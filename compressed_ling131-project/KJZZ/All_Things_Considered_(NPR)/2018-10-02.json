blocking or slowing down traffic or charging for faster loading the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nThe over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers should have over your Internet experience\nSo typically when people talk about in neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever let's say you want to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an apt to your visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal we have rising might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your ah\nOr your Internet experience so typically when people talk about net neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever what say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app\nThat you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal wherever I might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix store data just restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this stuff now but California has gone through what has the reaction\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nUm the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your rise in your Comcast that have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place and are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why there during the\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies including immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and things to them\nFor and yeah it's an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and think to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how goes California so goes the rest of the nation\nOr all the Texas play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office and\nThe department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature\nOf of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it so what does this mean for consumers and companies will this fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect in January at this
