you couldn't talk about the fair\nAbout the numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and your questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the judge and he should have been here for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals and our auto parts\nYou know him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that is certainly true I think\nHe said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what time is on I had\nBy the way he acted like in ...\nI think the response would had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right [laughter] they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice forward sure one\nBrett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not base he released based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people are questioning her integrity and I certainly will\nCaring about the rule of law and not base he released based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with bitter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate is up or when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault in progress\nSpiking women's ... gang rape if that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\n... and very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said\nThat you know I think there is no

who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move this country in a better direction

that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all the facts\nThat's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted\nThey did not interview many many many witnesses who were identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others\nWho would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what his doctor for think about that [noise]\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to

the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred fifty thousand workers starting in November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe decided to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work

century Miami I started working off the store is a process in the company that you received a merchandise\nAnd Maine to bring the inventory on his farm ... hours and now with the trees were going to

it's been more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for ... full time job you're going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho do want to raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with um you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses so particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does it\nHire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour most of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money would this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you\nWere before so I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase in the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming\nIdea why why why do they not so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that this conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers\nKnown for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number the median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for family of four\nNow that is a worldwide number is what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company is run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been putting quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nThis weekend be aware that I tend east is narrow to one lane between Seventy ninth and

let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activist who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting ... McDonald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are there people who continue to support officer midnight\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nReform what are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWell what'd you say some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that day started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officer said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nYou've mentioned in the pockets of reported on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open it it certainly doesn't bring closure\nOf pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform look like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past\nThat the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's gonna happen from here\nThat's Jenn ... she's the host of sixteen shots at a podcast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer
