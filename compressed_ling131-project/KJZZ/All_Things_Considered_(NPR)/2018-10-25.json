Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nBut those envelopes weren't all of this suspicious packages reported today for more on this we're joined by NPR justice correspondent

FBI says that these envelopes were addressed to George Soros he's a billionaire a big contributor to democratic causes a Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan\nThe package that was intended for Brennan was sent to CNN's New York office right on not clear why that was but\nYes there were other people who said they received ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however a package of didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives\nAnother was California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nUS Capitol police say that they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her they say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI right now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package\nA doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late in the clear at this point but the FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that ah it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know that at this point\nSo what do we know about the five packages that the FBI discussed in its announcement earlier\nWell law enforcement official described him as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the one set the CNN or the package also is said to have contained

I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes it difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program and she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be\nThat was frustrating for men does\nAnd it kind of just made a decision between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program well she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nBut these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nIn starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to over ...\n... all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend\nOur friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her on

acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's cuts to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope I don't mind sharing it what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in\nThinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid in for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work so it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband to suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think is incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nHusband grew up here was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad a competitive bike racer\nIdea of of having 'em up here or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or lily leaves dad and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movements and changing social norms and changing the things that need to change\nKids are catalysts to change

some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them and did that was that\nHappening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about

US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you ... are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and and she was partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration I Want\nTo get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nThat uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and interest partly because we literally reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration I Want\nTo get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president's incidents\n[noise] well I I I I Know they call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America as unaccompanied children and I was failing units incentivized by laws we passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the northern Arab countries would have been southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when we say that we're that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I've never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds as opposed we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and\nThat was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad\nBut it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some effect check up a second claim with you had President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me play you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it it's a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change laws so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask\nYou the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison and is down there and in some way shape\nI mean just before we move on from this ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufactured controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison Rand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest German homeland security most of these laws are under my means jurisdiction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because that is this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling the so I tried to go through this as a business person would\nA problem solver gather the information find the ... in our community we you know we all want to secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained that we want enforce our laws and that we don't separate families so try to go through a problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time every

Kelly apologized\nTo show I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment\nBy NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David ... so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with a civil panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] it's really you do get in trouble if you are a white person who was on the wane or a black person who puts on weight like a kid that was okay as long as you were dressed like a character\nAnd then of course a tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by what\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply is notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story of both by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding\nAmerican history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply or is it notable in two ways one of which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe owes bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin perhaps the newest co host of today's show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and it's nice and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself\nAh NBC News German Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time making Kelly as his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw [noise]\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge Fox News host she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment against some of NBC's biggest stars not only maps\nSanta Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white ... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings\nAre and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times and me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction in and a welcome from a employees that NBC she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd a ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money or for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fire as a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nRound here would we do every year old who was in fact we joke that October is black ... I've been an advocate Halloween is is Christmas at all\nMeeting factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween after Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear where they um we do every year unquote which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and not allowing advent Halloween is is Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costume and comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well\nWalk us through some of the history of this when did we first started seeing blacks in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds on may become central to Mr all shows on which why people would dress up like by people by talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course he's missile shows depicted black people as lazy as animal is to play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad human disease and that allows slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black for [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow fever trails of Asian American ... think of ... character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against us\nTo be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOne of the people who are caffeine caricatured ... often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences\nOf Asian American people and think of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against them\nTo be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOne of the people who are caffeine caricatured were often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missile shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... [noise] to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history ... what do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance is not a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel this all white and I went to the port and she seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up and black face\nAnd that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of brought a conflict so you always start in a historical vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you've raised it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when these controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person independence and no one at that party made bad an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations will be better served if we spent\nAnd no one at that party made bad an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of imagery as well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black base\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen thank\nYou so much Mary Louise the networks over [laughter] I Hope not [noise]\nThis\nIs NPR News and the ... the the Ninety\nOne point five year with all things considered\nAnd Kmart host of America on the line during that fast frantic and gripping time in our nation's political history getting hard to say up on the latest news the joined me for America on the line a national polling show about politics in the mid term every Monday through Thursday for the latest developments medical analysis and your calls\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and should O'Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nIs so actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nAbout the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now she wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nAnd or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now she wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here you know each\nCountry in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and bringing of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now\nTrans national in nature they're you know\nBut he's getting started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to Central America\nUnited States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here\nIn our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you told her to\nKnow I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it's in the end\nIs the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations actually much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out this ancient part of the brain it may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planting NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and doesn't box lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit that still backs\nEven holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effort less\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some boxes the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results for re more exciting and clear than I could've ever dreamt\nDoesn't doc says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists the neurologist had been missing in front of the time\nAnd do some Knox says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nWe have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking started rather editing are your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Syria but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs at on both and cognition means that served by them is involved in those process sees as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving\nIsn't to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Sarah but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs involved and cognition means that served by them is involved in those process to use as well\n... says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cut emissions and emotion as well\nMom and says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution that when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder all have a link to cerebellum\nAnd ... says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton
