accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you go or don't remember where was the place I don't remember how many years you don't want to but I don't know [noise] and today and\nThe White House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how these comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nOr just a motor users can do it was like the first woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it\nSeem to be hearing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThan last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really the verging from that line and he was playing it to laugh and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some\nHow the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote you know one thing that has\nBeen swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump or Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise laughter cheered\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica

uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd we'll send a senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts here in the U. S. thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states [noise]\nAlso manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum or so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be ... for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry and not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S and some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty per se\nCourse for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry they're not gone away\nNo they haven't I think one of the things we have the mind is ... particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just isn't worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have is the administrators cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the ... on a quick minute Manufacturers Association thanks for speaking with us today\nAnd he was a

with their parents that is from a scathing report from them\nAnd professor officer now teaches law at the University of St Thomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government was so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to has the children and where did it even have a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the ... inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da Jessica Terry cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care of I don't believe the press they are very well taken care of it\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da just held hundreds of migrant children and border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and human service\nAnd that including one child who was held for twenty five days and many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assist in after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da chest said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote\nChildren who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children it anyway no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that the authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa just does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\nAre there any children who still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Jill you're walking [noise]\n...

considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories money for the first time Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAnd her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how many people have been sharing the column on line and I spoke with Monica has to be about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I have never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail some women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry\nThe someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but I think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim too\nBut I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of ... exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean\nBy that [noise] you know it just just think about tropes in sitcoms where the dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can never make\nWe do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women\n[noise] can you tell us about some of the responses that you have to this call them since it was published this week [noise]\nYeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yep please deer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your\nCan you tell us about some of the response was that you have to call them since it was published this week [noise] [noise]\nYeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response drop please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions I shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi\nWhile so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say\nI always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send\nBecause what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nThink so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time because of what we're\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell her father's about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing in the cabin up for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ...

House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that\nWell we think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace\nAnd then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the Trump didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties\nRuss ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us\nToday Thanks for having me or New York times story you just heard about says Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years that doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades is simply lie\nVoid and puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the ... side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades is simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns as now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources they are not going to be allocating it toward gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat peers to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions a law and the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to persist\nBecause Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it\nAnd why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut ... says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS finds evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThere's a new mandate for corporations in California by the end of

but on the other hand you want to cry because I Can't believe they'll pay twenty eight pain we need a bill to mandate gender equality\nWhen California Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law he
