secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the package in ... at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and

I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the ... sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms were going to dig into this with Wisconsin\nRepublican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was probably because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the\nImmigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration I Want\nTo get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I Know they call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes\nEr so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president's incidents\n[noise] well I I I don't know if I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the ... year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a company children and I was failing units incentivized by laws we passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here\nOur legal system allows him to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the northern Arab countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was the order that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now true for you it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had that I I Do not have any specific evidence in this care bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were\nSome ... ... a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this current event might let me tell you what he said\nWant caravans they liked the care of it\nYes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's\nHow I've had I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with you a President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me play you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask\nYou the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a president and is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest river homeland security most of these laws aren't under my means jurisdiction we've got another my Comey's jurisdiction because that is this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would a problem solver\nMr that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of our products driven homeland security most of these\nLaws are under my measures diction we've gotta do to my community leaders diction because that was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I tried to go through this as a business person would\nBe a problem solver gather the information fine beers regret meant in our committee with you know we all want to secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained that we want enforce our laws and then we don't separate families will try to go through a problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and that may be successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time every day it's Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine,

was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash\nA decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down and two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here ... yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what does the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear it today a sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here\nIt was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed fifty\nAnd here it's emotional\nYeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear\nToday a sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on the way here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and step son the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs it's a beautiful here too yeah very elevated he writes a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and the days are over and I'm good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did it the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck [noise] current workplace policies that eighty\nDid it the auto plant but he says it's enough are not happy still not happy still miss that people still miss my job representing people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we

is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scrubs a\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field grew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point\nWas used to being independent used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that\nWasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say\nUsed to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled in on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say a big percentage of them\nIn and it gets any kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that but I Do see around town people that\nI worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he\nWas a tea do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know that's how I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retire and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's

has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us into take a
