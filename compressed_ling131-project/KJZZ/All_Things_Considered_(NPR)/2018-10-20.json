California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the\nAddress is by requiring the high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop but first you want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office she needed a Coby was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times Mr Coby later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds and sort of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were just yeah I bet someone wouldn't you describe those things you\nNot have sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know\nPretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he has been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds that sort of those those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone you wouldn't you described those things you might not\nSo for example do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate\nYes that's absolutely accurate\nDo you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection out so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble\nMen so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected to issues of poverty that aren't as connected issued a mental health in certain areas and connected to it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that then I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who shouted out of the root causes a story that needed to be told\nThat's about a Kobe she's the sister of she naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nYou know

on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks busiest shows\nAnd let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week that you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular Ninety show\nAfter its star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which mere this week and we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nAre possible we knew she had a problem she was only a pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just starting to probe Scott to be wrong\nWe want us to talk about so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks so much for joining us\nPleasure to be here so it's like you also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online Jeff welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you see it you know it's\nInteresting because anytime a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming and a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide be inside right\nRoseanne how did you say you know it's really interesting because\nAny time a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming in a lot of ways in our society there is a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances\nOr that provide be inside right and in this case one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweet that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and potentially lead to this behavioral change so there was a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the real world is our culture guy though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI I you know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the absence of Roseanne was was powerful so I I thought they did a pretty good job actually of addressing a very difficult topic\nI said I Know you're not a critic but you're deeply immersed in covering this crisis okay and I just wondered if you felt about it as a person who knows a lot about the reality of the situation\nUm I I started I didn't see the show as a matter of fact I was speaking on rural Ohio\nA one when the show was running a ... about this very topic in various places on rural Ohio um but um I I thought you know I I use those of this as a vehicle for for a a dramatic or crop Tom at a um show sounds\nAre important sounds are a very timely I'm Amazed that actually has to say more shows

a dramatic or crop comic a um show sounds\nAre important sounds a a a very timely I'm Amazed that actually as to say more shows don't but I think that's\nKind of part and parcel of this epidemic this epidemic has always been a quiet and hidden and so it's only now that you're seeing it being used in in in a in a few ways or as a dramatic vehicle hotel that's what\nThe quiet and the heart of it because you know a recent NPR poll reveals set a quarter of rural Americans feel that appeared in other drug abuse is the biggest problem in their local communities and I take it to sound that you feel that this is a story that's been overlooked in hot kind of hiding in plain sight tell me why you feel that way\nUh I I I I Would I Do that pull does not surprise me at all and I do believe as you say that this has been um the quiet when I mean it's the deadliest epidemic in our country's history and it's been percolating for Twenty years and yet it's only you can really say only in the last three years when I was writing my book dreamland\nI I found it very little echo out there of very difficult time getting people interested in this ah who didn't have anything directly to do with it it was very much reminded me very much of the early days of the AIDS epidemic everyone wanted to hide it didn't want to confront it you know and and and I I think what's happened is that this is\nA been left to fester and ... all across this country now and a critical mass was reached\nA at a certain point so now it's become come out of the shadows but\nBut it's definitely a a a problem that has not
