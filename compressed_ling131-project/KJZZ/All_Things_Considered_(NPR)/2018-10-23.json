range nuclear forces arms control treaty now president Ronald Reagan signed this treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nFor the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire trash of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nHere with me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president as NPR national security correspondent David Welna welcome to the studio coyote okay so the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty or we can call it the INS what does history to actually do\nWell you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S in the Soviet Union had nuclear missiles deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could reach their targets in only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty requires the destruction of all these intermediate range land base\nI ... what does history to actually do\nWell you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S in the Soviet Union had nuclear tipped missile deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could research targets in only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty requires the destruction of all these intermediate range land base nuclear missiles once and for all and it really was the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nNow President Trump says Russia has not been in compliance with the treaty do we know this is true\nWell you know U.S officials beginning with President Obama four years ago have been saying that Russia has been cheating on this treaty\nThat Russia's been deploying some land base intermediate range cruise missiles that could strike targets in Eastern Europe in violation of the treaty but Obama did not want to kill this arms control treaty figuring that it's still provided a means for talking with the Russians at least\nOf course Ronald Reagan Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nWell you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal\nI think this really shows that the Russia hawks and the administration are getting their way and it's not the state department is doing this even though that's traditionally where such policies are carried out this bears the hallmarks of national security adviser John Bolton he's\nNever liked arms control deal he wrote in two thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and Bolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response when the Russian government\nAre not great Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei rehab cough was quoted yesterday by the Russian news agency task says calling this move blackmail by the U.S he also called it a very dangerous step is there\nNever liked arms control deal he wrote in two thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and Bolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response when the Russian government\nAre not great Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei rehab cough was quoted yesterday by the Russian news agency task says calling this move blackmail by the U.S he also called it a very dangerous step\nIs there any chance that Russia can gain something from the U.S spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remember thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has stockpiled ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the ... might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and proper like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to joined the INS if the U.S started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policies since Nineteen seventies the thrust has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stalled nuclear arms race get going again\nAfter all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna that David thank you for your reporting\nYou're welcome Audi residents of the Florida Panhandle are still reeling from the

million combinations of lottery tickets\nHe waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split time\nThe biggest problem with

all in so his secret\nWas get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of

I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life has over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wild child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents who have two choices leave your child and the U.S to pursue asylum\nOr bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand your child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nEven under stand her child welfare law state law they would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing or people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is

just killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul NPR's Greg Myre is here to tell us more about that visit Greg hey so what is hospitals we're all here\nWell she's got a very significant role in not only with her title is head of the CIA this is a place she knows really well we know she speaks Turkish I'm In a rare speech recently she said is simple along with London or two of her favorite cities in the world\nTo CIA never says exactly where somebody spent their undercover days but she clearly knows this place she's a player she knows how the\nThe how things to take place there um and remember the U.S turkey and the Saudis are allies and they are conducting these sort of separate investigations\nBut there's also negotiations going on on this is probably not likely to end so much in a court room as a as a political agreement in some sort of negotiation so that's a key thing I think to keep watching\nSo what is the White House hoping to accomplish by sending hospital there\nWell the president clearly wants to stay in very quickly he's been very close to the Saudis he wants to resume these close ties and have\nBusiness go on a pretty much as usual but he's been very inconsistent in his responses he's talked about a a credible investigation and then he's talked about things he's not so sure of severe punishment but then he talks about the value of arms deals so he's been all over the place so here's what he said just today\nSomebody really messed up and they had the worst cover up ever and where should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because whoever thought of that\nResponses he's talked about a a credible investigation and then he's talked about things he's not so sure of severe punishment that then he talks about the value of

whether they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble\n[noise] so I think the president is looking for Haspel and and Mike Pompeo to give him a clear picture of actually what happened who is responsible so that there can be some sort of a clear policy uh put in place\nIn the meantime turkey has been revealing more and more information each day about what they say happened inside the Saudi conflict do we have a better sense about what they want to happen next\nYeah I think we saw today president or the wind gave this big speech and he talked about this being a premeditated murder so he's clearly still playing hardball with the Saudis\nAnd and they've got some real issues turkey and Saudi Arabia are rivals turkey wants to be seen as the preeminent
