Warren for years\nAnd it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat moles a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either pay [noise]\nStart with exactly what did Elizabeth Warren released today\nShould she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos was to mind day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\nYou know in addition to this DNA Analysis Warren also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and some vignettes from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she calls ... their DNA researcher and puts him on the line\nYou did five five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one of 'em\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts saying we have a Native American ancestry you're better\nSo ... you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nCan also here or at least who one of members of the intended audience of that video is the president himself a lady\nWants to call my mom a lawyer what are the facts and even though we haven't heard of nerve your interest or your bedroom\nSo ... you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nCan also here or at least who one of members have been to an audience of video is the president himself a lady responded to although he has\nAnd no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this I won't\nA

call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned the choose eyeing a run for president herself in twenty twenty I think that's a really\nGod's at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a

aspirations we mentioned that she is offering a run for\nPresident herself and twenty twenty I think that's a really realistic I did this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHis taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty race is going to kick off pretty much in his mid term\nVery briefly has quieted all of this ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the

that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitments as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia or do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent

also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this is happening more because President Trump is in office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blondes a attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad\nThe first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American

years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don ... depending on what level there and that's the warden showed dom showing us around and do what we do that and the community is when I was fired for our outside and our yard within ... and I guess it's still a\nPrison the war is the

and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than Iowa is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow Don tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for a men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang

free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nRescue so they're forced to live here and then right if\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's presidents several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in a basement sold his property or victims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of

to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained about the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said is you know ordinary people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm

he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east it coming up coming up

Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that cushion or could act as a back channel\nOr to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear as some of these dealings are are not transparent up but we do
