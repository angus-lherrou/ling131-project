I I get it on our soldiers\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I talked to Lisa flesh or Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nEven know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard\nYou ran into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area that's right I I talked to Lisa flesh or Jackson enter nice\nEli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother's no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in the Senate guys this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified with what happened and I hope that we could make some some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but as a tack on\nOn everybody in a community and market we're strong and then we're going to make it through\nAnd uh as I said she was with her knees to sixteen Eli they both so you know just as many generations of his family have ties to the neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials\nWell I wouldn't have\nHad tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support to the families that\n[noise] so so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and Lisa the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about we definitely need to have gone lives but we definitely don't need to have you know security guards at our schools at our temples at our church is\nShouldn't have to I mean some are we supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers to this but where we go to press on even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nYou also getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so I think so\nWe definitely don't need to have you know security guards on at our schools at our temples at our church as\nWe shouldn't have to I mean summer is supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers are to that but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here right now\nWhat fair you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah thanks taxing and other Pittsburgh faith community strict time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue the ...

people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell ... said he that he held a special service to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and bonds\nAnd that is fine but we must do more we much put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today does yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back\nIn the open and affirming you mean other than everyone's ... everyone is welcome to actually write and everyone is welcome and unknown\nNot the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today because yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid that puts a target on her back\nAnd I open and affirming you mean other than every once in a while because everyone is welcome to sexual right everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of ah folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning\nAnd to offer the words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship\nBut they did come and to say thank you for doing this it makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses in honor of\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events or because he was a police officer in white whole not where the ... a perpetrator lives\nSo it was very frightening for us personally um I I Try to allow God's the urge to give me the ...\nThat I Need I I Do not fear for myself

what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school\nAnd my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school or things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plan anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking about\nWe also met a father and son oldest and Matthew ...
