have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely when we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says limos should have their own standards because they're neither Carson or buses\nRegular started to Jim in between the two of them have come up with nothing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill crews and find has the c._e._o. of dread unlocks a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified wouldn't be should be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars that amount is from from from the value of some of those Lindsey\nButtons on day also says he personally would support more safety regulation\nThere should be nationwide shortage of

the impact you can see how they were given a talk when we installed with certain place underneath the vehicle and on the interior of the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say Leno's often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and find tastes as\nSome of the public not care about the safety for ... they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the onus shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's this really grossly unfair people of course they always care about safety I just think most people assume that if they're in the business that the minimum requirements that they have to be\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety\nIn twenty Fifteen there was a deadly limo crash on Long Island

today us stocks on their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent decline here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah I was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stop praising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand that usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so [noise]\nSo it still has a way to go to get there so\nThe way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now\nWell Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets that wages will began to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation\nPressures that you were saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market\nEconomy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today's sell off is not the end of the bowl marketed stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe has cooled it bit as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than glowing assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S and China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any particular area is that the market that had been hurt by the sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the market sold off today a wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market\nIn fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today and that some ... five hundred which also has a lot of tech lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech and very tough day but is this just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down was due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached\nAnd that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tech lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech a very tough day but is this just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so Trump said the selling toward the end of the day which took the dial down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates they're paying you starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what happens we'll see That's NPR's John Ydstie Thanks John You're welcome\n\nYou're
