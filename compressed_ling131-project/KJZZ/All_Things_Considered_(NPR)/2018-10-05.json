have jumped over the last month perhaps because of Calvin all do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact ... congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats had great they're fighting the battle ground in the suburbs and they are eagerly courting women there and this has energized them the Senate battle ground on the other hand is in states the Trump one and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's much harder situation for Democrats up for reelection and those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is some we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a note when this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and I'm the state of North Dakota right that's right

thanks so much ... well as we just heard Kelsey note there the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I uh eventually did reach them by phone the did than telling me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact the former run that had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases of bailout\nSo you filled out this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I read by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question yeah\nI think it's relevant because first of all the ones who lived in front of the so usually a committee or what\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or what has taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes there is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... confused that was passing out but the black neon phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one new\nThey let me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered to this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about making eighty three eighty four eighty five at

more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it up but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find\nElse so you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this is been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now said that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it's\nOpportunities if employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish\nIn the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive\nBecause if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's ...

vote\nYet she basically used her speeches it kind of closing argument it was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically was saying that he is not that extreme

Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot the McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon how this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell I think that's I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with eight second degree murder charge\nThis is something we haven't will happen in Chicago for decades so I think by those activists it's dealing like a moment of celebration we've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will move for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually\nTook the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described it\nFor decades so I think for those activists it's feeling like a moment of celebration we've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described ... McDonald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes as blank um he said that the\nThat that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking at the dashcam video of this incident so the prosecutors really pushed him hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this further to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community well\nI think that's hard to say that because I think that the tensions here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there's another trial of laid it to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald a preventive at night and there were reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem with the community feels but also vast feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'd be watching that closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that\nToo we reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is only ... exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shots sixteen made a big difference up in this case I also

testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes

judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to know\nHim well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation and his family that he would have acted like an all time to time I had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic ...\nI think the response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot\nDamned if you did at the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nWhile I forward sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that welders are reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific were marketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics absolutely\nI I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nThe history

around to the computer in the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen when we sent that out into the world\nDidn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment me knew that this was part of the

on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation what it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party like to say as we were working on it he

do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the pro and con the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um\nTo the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the meet him this meant and I think there are two
