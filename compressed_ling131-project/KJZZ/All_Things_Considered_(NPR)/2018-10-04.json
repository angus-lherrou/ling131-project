in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's this is very current yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all of these seven Russian officers are\nIn Russia

large collision knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized\nThat means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor what does rock vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon rock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today\nAnd we proposed that are men grows within the rock paper of the earth after a giant impact so the moon actually ...\nAnd on and heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nTo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was out from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that owns the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\n[laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nDemonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince\nOurselves first how long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nA amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to tests where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event in the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act\nIt left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind

the time the Trump Administration open NAFTA negotiations fixing the dairy market was a top priority and it wasn't until Canada agreed to end the controversial policy the new trade agreement was
