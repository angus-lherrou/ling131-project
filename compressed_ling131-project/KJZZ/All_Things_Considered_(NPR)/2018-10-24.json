seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system like Ken ... visit him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of spending over seven million dollars to buy all the sharing the lottery just seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plan was defined Monday I tracked him

I'm sixty lay among which was good shoes\nHe decides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural ... so he goes to the library and he starts reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery there that if he buys certain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so we pools his money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe want Seventy two thousand shutdown that made you lay which was about eight years of Charlotte\nBig score that was on your first try yeah he takes the money and he leaves Romania for

time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets\nHe waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split pot\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find the winning tickets and then turning them all in so\nHis secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a

and update on migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union the ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court\nMexico right now an update on the migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me so we should first said that the vast\nMajority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification\nLike one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country of ... of miles from where the parents are and I would say over two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over if I'm killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents who have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct DUIs\nAllegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about four year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government had no idea what happened to the parents we are the ...\nFour year old kids through your kids were not being reunited with

been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza has battled with

junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a mayor bootstraps mentality Kathy\nEvil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have done in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students\n[noise] but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first to kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program and she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nOf these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping new car\nPrevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about

just to point than say what they're going through so they don't feel like giving up\nLilley has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength could eat with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model when talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nI actually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share but like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope I don't mind sharing it what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in\nIn the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the

and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having 'em up here or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think is incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seen as a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or ... dad and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nAre really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris says the
