trip she was traveling as first\nUs taxpayers we're footing the bill for exactly this is our first big sort of goodwill tour so to speak and what was the agenda\nWell I mean she said she was there to spread the message about the best which has her initiative and the welfare children and she also worked with the u._s._a.

cultural tour she wanted to learn more about tourism in Egypt for example it was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and that was her undertaking this awkward\nBecause her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good that American foreign aid does was that\n... ... it's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised eyebrows and also just going to Africa that earlier this year he was accused of\nUm perhaps saying some derogatory comments about what she wanted to do is say here is what this organization is doing and in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly it didn't feel awkward when we were there\nBut the head of time it was a head scratcher\nHer wardrobe got a lot of coverage on this trip as it often does

today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer but he sold and and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made a pastor Brunson case a priority and Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's pastor around a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home [noise] All right\nCharges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's districts that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but\nWill for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter

the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was my attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd a trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why our ships\nI came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why our corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns for you to lay which makes ... in fact a vending machine Scott uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they\nWould not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime to our\nValued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers\nSo present with wholesale cost the Fritos have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of freedom is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like Fritos\nHas almost nothing to do as well food prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means that\nHonda missed at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do as well food prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies\nSo that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just get the shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma demo capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he gave us another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about this offering companies a low minimum um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now is tails up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nTrafficking category unlike many of the other hand categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power or\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks\nAre consuming more of what sex\nBacking growing category unlike many of the other food categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat's good for him [noise]\nAnd that was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie catch the\nIndicator from Planet Money for planet\nMoney comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their ...

NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases\nConsidered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse while at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWill cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is and the knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal release today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty of his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nProven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them well and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when a number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turn\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions where\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of\nThe people they were there to serve in this case children I think there is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing

attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think he said it's gone crazy\nI think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten Don ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so\nHow usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's a monetary policy and maybe didn't call the fed crazies no I don't know\nSo how usual is it for the president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its minister ration often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the thank crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision maker\nWith this public pressure okay so up until now fed officials had been defending the sad from the president's attacks but\nThen today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nUh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president said how sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nNo I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will contest\nDoing do you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the

has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending Miller I think is very well insulated I Do get concern that if the president keeps up his attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what
