announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nActually seeing sort of the top\nFor the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall from MIT [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our swath of a better word that colonel quite ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient

says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly\nAnd just send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life

researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks\nThat means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word no Greenfieldboyce NPR News\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News innocence kj ...

cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the ... say pretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate of what was happening in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red type out the borders and that without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential for terrorists as well\nSo the u._k. treasuries estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than I otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit as ... as sort of an aircraft gradually losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person would be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nIf those are the potential

about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as ... as sort of an aircraft gradually losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person would be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe the u._k. leaves without a deal\nWell for the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European ... so they were the U.S an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's somewhat and they won produces in France ... she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they ... they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my base assumptions still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense\nA by the politicians there

pleasure\n... ... ...\n...\n...\n... you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry but what's your company do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou know just like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to where again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship outnumber parents said the trust between Wilbur and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies and we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues that one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies in of all sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better in the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically it\nBetween ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies and we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies and evolved sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to the future and then the ... he didn't do better because then maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result those those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brain sort of works on script singer sticks and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter] yeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we've we've which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was a just a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nWe were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found\nThe magic was money [laughter] yeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um that we tested apologies\nWith or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that you might miss that part of it was a message to sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or you're the you're the editors and flowers oh eight flowers and candy and so it takes\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\nWhen people don't always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always are might be skeptical whenever I apologized so up to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere remorseful because people are always was like oh you're just you're not be with their paper\n[noise] no apologies for

reporting a lot of enthusiasm about voting we've seen record turnouts in primaries in special elections and\nWhat's the closing argument but both parties are settling on\nWell the closing argument from Republicans who began thinking that the tax cut bill and the booming economy would boost them but as the tax cuts got less popular they're closing argument is now warning voters that Democrats will take away the tax cuts\nPut regulations back on the economy wrecked the economy there kind of reverting to the Trump culture war issues which do energize their base talking about hordes of

opponent out raised us\nWe can't let the Democrat mob take over Congress\nDemocrats on the other hand have stuck to health care which is the number one issue for voters this year except for their

really one Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nThey thought those states would turn red they thought oh Iowa and Ohio would no longer be swing states they'd be solidly red but they are really struggling in the mid west the next two weeks will tell us whether that's true so they're worried about exciting their base\nIn the industrial heartland a Trump and another problem for Republicans as the Trump kept telling his supporters there's a red wave and borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually

time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and

also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation\nThat stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I tried to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be

because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like like Adams many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones

diplomatic compound in a foreign country and then if the worst is true dismembered him and have him disappear\nYou just spoke about feeling this personally and how has his disappearance affected your team and affected you\nKnow it's it's very painful or first of all he was well loved by many people [noise] you know if this could happen to gym all it can happen to any journalist and pets to my mind not the kind of world any of us want to live in\nAs many things that struck me about his last column that you published today one is that he thinks the post for publishing his work not only in English but in Arabic to reach obviously uh Arabic speaking in reading audience and I want to ask how common practice that is and why you chose to do that in his case\nBecause we see our mission as I'm presenting a range of opinions\nAcross a wide ideological diverse landscape especially in countries where people can't get it from their own media and Jamal was you know the reason he left Saudi

Internet or do you have any way of tracking how widely read his columns have been either in English or Arabic in his home country and Saudi Arabia\nSo we have certainly seen when we translate are editorials orange balls pieces or other pieces into Arabic\nGet a big spike in readership from the region [noise] one of the most heartbreaking things about this is that he was a patriot he supported a lot of the reforms of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia says he's four\nBut he believed that the best way to accomplish them was to allow people to debate them and uh to express opinions and I'm In the long run that's the way his country was going to succeed\nAnd I think we're trying to contribute in that same vein\nFriend high it he's the editorial page editor of the Washington Post and a
