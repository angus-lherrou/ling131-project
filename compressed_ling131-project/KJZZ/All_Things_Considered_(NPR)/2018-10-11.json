interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred a rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it was stopped rising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation right around or their ears and inflation right now well\nFederal Reserve chair a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures\nSo you're saying

Alexei as cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launch\nA wood working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong and the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing

have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of\nInformation people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem of manufacturing problem who knows [noise] and then once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the

human retina requires a lot of patients it takes between seven month than a year you're Eldridge should know she's a graduate student in a lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years

annoyed it\nReally looks an acts like a developing retina that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light and color Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an Eldridge shot chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe discuss this crazy idea of could we use the human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things cells in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells with key because you can't study human color vision in a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't fence read they don't have these red detecting cells and so\nWe really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first and come cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fibroid hormone was involved in the development of these colors ... so called home so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added thyroid harm on to that dish during their development and we got more red green ... developing and organize and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that thigh ride hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nWant us to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is at this\nFrom that side right or mine was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnston says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nOne is to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that's the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision that condition that's been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular\nSo Johnson hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular Oregon writes Steven backer of the national eye Institute says that he was like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye these\nStudies show that the similarity is quite high\nEnd Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize
