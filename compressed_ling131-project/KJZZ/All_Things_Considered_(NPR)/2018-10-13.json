aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they are the heart of the Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe so when we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen\nA waste or industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg I'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these air this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nIt's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now and just a single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple electrical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and\nCongress buckled under watched him and a half an hour yeah yeah I watched it out there's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal

badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no ... very limited cell service and no outside help yeah\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the harder the or Easter industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they they were struggling

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well and here's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place in what exactly he'd been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church in is mayor and western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do\nWith this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey and of course turkey one\nMovement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's districts that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nAnd they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the clerics are to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDemocracy Yogi case right and I think\nIt's in your delivering it thirty five fighter just a turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the clerics are to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things possible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia here and just tumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you have to show your case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he\nWas brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they're the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why our corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay fine thanks\nHistory why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machine Scott uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we called the they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things\nI Know a luckily there was a second clue a note lifted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably wholesale cost the Fritos has gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how\nNaive to think that's all that's in a bag or Fritos Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nShe says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do as well food prices\nKilled is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have\nAll the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets and MIT analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies aluminum um because the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now is tails up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking growing category alive many of the other food categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now\n[noise]\nThat's good for [noise]\nCan prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks that's our best gas for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get

for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no alternative conclusion other than the Russians faceless ...\nBack in September of British authorities held a press

a Russian spy\nIt's tough because those guys you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise] when\nYou look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of Russia and just random Russian guys going through in kind of sightseeing at this like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they liked photographing is it's wall of fame

tips off next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court not a player as she\nIs right the athletic Rand Paul Knight is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic collide\nThat was a shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great won't Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good\nSo why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nYeah so they had it for a ... and it was very short lived they sign just one clear and been quarter and build up broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years though when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so of course with a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players are today that er\nYeah so they had it for a in Nineteen Ninety eight and it was very short lived they had signed just one player and Vince Carter and that deal that broken after two years and so they've been out to a game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nThese elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal\nWith tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they were able to attract people like ... and the prime gene is ... even in a position to be going after any might not raining\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles for any new comer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike hat about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough to bind okay [laughter] yeah they do have they\nDo have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed sixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old darned about end to mark his cousin\nTerms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is is a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIncredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that you know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media is she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are\nBradley aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have it's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that you\nKnow we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out puma hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that and MIT's made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting and she ran them what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on his ... and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really leaning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes that they don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers the

Tennessee and Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November\nBut the main thrust of her Instagram post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate in the race she said she likes to support women who are running for office but she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn because a lot of the policies that Blackburn has supported in Congress\nUm she said they're not hurt Tennessee values\nAnd high profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh well so

I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are\nYou know there's a a man who's object to find women with a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never while I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to

women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by my\nParents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of the same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling for me\nWhat is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have these wild on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the

of the culture but in hip hop\nAnd there was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quite right or I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nI Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman and the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity so having accented English actually does means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long but\nLanguages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual ... went to the United nations schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said but it goes cracking good job or she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really\nTry to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives that people's who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and I had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter]\nWas on

that people's who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is and you talk white you this that and yeah I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure pleasure\nAnd finally today we're going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called the codes which is all about race and identity in America and in our most recent
