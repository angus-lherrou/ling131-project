any of those things in Panama City or any of the surrounding suburbs\nUm so you know we are seeing an emergency response to really start to step up and get these things out to people but it's you know it remains a challenge to find some to get supplies into some of the harder hit areas\nI'm In the suburbs to the east of Panama City and also up into rural inland communities that were hit really hard by the storm um that are a little more difficult to reach so you know the emergency response is getting underway but I'm sure it's going to be awhile before it reaches everybody who is affected\nAnd communication is still really happened places where phone services downed Internet's down how has that affected rescue efforts\nI think it has been a real problem I mean cell phone service those non existent for days after the storm and it's still really spotty I'm In Panama City in the surrounding county\nAnd it's difficult because people can't coordinate the emergency response it's hard to you know tell people where to go if you can't communicate with them\nAnd it it's also making it really difficult for people to call their family members and check in and say hey I you know I'm OK I'm here

Boston hey Carey high at first what are the arguments being made in the case\nStudents for fair admissions the group that filed this lawsuit will be trying to prove essentially for things in this case first they say that Harvard illegally uses a quota system or racial balancing it admissions\nThey say the admissions rates for each demographic group or or two similar from year to year a second the group is arguing that Harvard admissions is considering race too much or that it's a deciding factor and not just a factor of a factor like affirmative action policy actually allows\nThe group also thinks that Harvard has an adequately explored admissions methods that don't use race they say that you really can still get a diverse class by considering things like geography and socioeconomic status\nBut as you mentioned the biggest delegation here is that Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with

considering things like geography and socioeconomic status but as you mentioned the biggest delegation here is that Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of statistical analysis actually but it basically boils down to an argument where\nThey'll try to show that while Asian American applicants do have the highest academic qualifications or\nGPA standardized test scores things like that that they consistently or in lower personal scores from the admissions department and a a personal score is a number that Harvard assigns applicants to to write things like personal essays\nLetters of recommendation and even the amount of personal hardship that someone faced\nBut the person behind this lawsuit is an Asian American raid his name is Edward Blum can you tell us more about him\nThat is true yes Edward Blum is the president of students for fair admissions and that is the group that technically brought this lawsuit\nUm and this isn't Edward blooms first court case attacking affirmative action policies in higher education he's also spearheaded the lawsuit behind Fisher versus the University of Texas which he ultimately lost as you remember in the Supreme Court in twenty sixteen\nNow we did reach out to bloom for an interview up before trial but he declined we did speak with someone who is close to him Ilya Shapiro who's a he's a constitutional fellow at the Kato Institute\nHe explained blooms perspective to me this way\nYou as a as a society we're or race doesn't matter where government treats us all the same regardless it's got a caller archer Asian American applicants during the drug but for her because of a Los skirt illustrates the problem\nWhat is Harvard have to say well\nHarvard is standing behind their admissions policies and they say they don't\nBlume's perspective to me this way\nYou as a society we're already doesn't matter where governor treats us all this thing will guard also skeptical of our our share the Asian American students drug for her because of the Los skirt illustrates the problem is\nWhat is Harvard have to say\nWell Harvard is standing behind their admissions policies and they say they don't have a quota pointing to the fact that in the last five years they have admitted about twenty nine percent more Asian applicants\nHarvard's legal team will also be presenting data that refused the plaintiffs analysis over those lower personal scores\nAnd W. B. U.
