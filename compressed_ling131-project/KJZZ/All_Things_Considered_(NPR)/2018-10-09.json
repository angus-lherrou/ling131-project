Bolden who retired from the NFL last year after fourteen years as a wide receiver\nTo focus on a new career political activist Bolden is cofounder of the players coalition that group of player activists that emerged from the taken e controversy\nThe players coalition gets funding from the NFL for its activities among them getting young people out to vote which ankle embolden was working on just last night\nHe was back at Florida State in Tallahassee where he went to college to talk with current students and well\nBolden hey there [noise] hey I'm All right how are you holding up\nDown there I guess the hurricane warnings didn't uh didn't to interrupt the proceedings down there\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo let me ask you what was your pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell first of all your [noise]\nTo talk with courage students inclined Bolden hey there how are you doing\nI'm All right how are you holding up down there I guess the hurricane mornings didn't uh didn't interrupt the proceedings down there\nNot just being from Florida you use to hurt and one more year old\nSon let me ask you what was your pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote when you say\nWell I think first of all you have to let them know that number one their vote counts um you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about a more than just the sport that basically\nWe all athletes that you were talking to\nYou have to ... it was all athletes okay I'm a I think it's important for athletes to use their platform and in the right way but more so than just getting out of all I think\nYou have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of times the state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that are really affect you ate today like\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there now you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use this clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask them fairly basic question that but what just seems like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power has to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from the NFL but I Do think you'd want to hear from the players who are everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we're not affected by the laws of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete activists also fighting socially\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from an effort but I Do think you'd want to hear from the players who are everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we are not affected by the law of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete activists also citing social injustice but doing it in a different way from you I'm thinking is calling cap Bernanke thinking of Eric read both of whom have made a point not to join the players coalition ... are you in contact with them\nWere not in contact with them at this there was a time where we were trying to do something together that didn't work out so we're not\nThat I mentioned to people following along we've we've reached you on a not particularly great phone line in Florida but I think people can hear enough of what you're saying will carry on um we do that let me ask you why why are you pursuing it sounds like similar agendas fighting for social justice but not doing it together\nWell I think you know sometimes there's different ideas of how to go about making sure but I Will say that no matter how you decide to go about it I think all of the work is important that they're doing is important to work that we're doing as a coalition is important um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want to be an unrealistic and that was the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people who tried to deny what's really going on in our society and I think if I had our way\nEverybody was the thing is that what you see that there is a specific group of people in our country that's not treated fairly and heart would\nFor everybody feet at him for everybody to work together and come up with solutions to try to rectify that do you support the rate of current players too\nThere's a lot of people who tried to deny what's really going on and I thought and I think our way\nEverybody would be the way I see that there is a group of

players to take any during the anthem\nOf course if an athlete for me and it was a peaceful protests when I'm outside of the protests if you have to go into the war\nProtests and during the national

more than a year since the New York times ran an expose a alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct animal training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places and the rules apply to all employers

prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise the New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including my trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd then requires feedback from the employees about the training and the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies
