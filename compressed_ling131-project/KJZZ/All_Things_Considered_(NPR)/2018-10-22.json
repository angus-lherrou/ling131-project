range nuclear forces arms control treaty now president Ronald Reagan signed the treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nFor the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire trash of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nWith me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president as NPR national security\nIt leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House thirty one years ago\nBut the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire class of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nHere with me now to discuss why this treaty is no longer acceptable to another Republican president as NPR national security correspondent David Welna welcome to the studio coyote okay so the intermediate range nuclear forces arms control treaty or we can call it the INS what does history to actually do\nWell you know this was signed in the Nineteen eighties when the U.S in the Soviet Union had nuclear tipped missiles deployed along the periphery of Eastern Europe and they could reach their targets in only eight minutes which left almost no time for any response it was a very dangerous situation which neither the U.S nor the Soviet Union wanted to continue\nAnd so the treaty requires the destruction of all these intermediate range land base nuclear missiles once and for all and it really was the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nNow President Trump says Russia has not been in compliance with the treaty do we know this is true\nWell you know U.S officials beginning with President Obama four years ago have been saying that Russia's been cheating on this treaty\nThat Russia's been deploying some land base intermediate range cruise missiles that could strike targets in Eastern Europe in violation of the treaty but Obama did not want to kill this arms control treaty figuring that it's still provided a means for talking with the Russians at least\nOf course Ronald Reagan a Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nWell you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal I think this really shows that the Russia hawks and the administration are getting their way and it's not the states\nWith the Russians at least of course Ronald Reagan Republican hero right to the party what is the difference in philosophy here why we're seeing this president President Trump determined to pull out of the treaty\nWell you know Trump does not like international agreements he's already pulled out of the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal\nI think this really shows that the Russia hawks and administration are getting their way and it's not the state department is doing this even though that's traditionally where such policies are carried out this bears the hallmarks of national security adviser John Bolton\nHe's never liked arms control deal he wrote in two thousand eleven that the u._s. should leave the treaty and Bolton is in Moscow today and tomorrow delivering that message what's been the response when the Russian government\nAre not great Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei rehab cough was quoted yesterday by the Russian news agency has says calling this move blackmail by the U.S he also called it a very dangerous step\nIs there any chance that Russia can gain something from the U.S spelling out\nThere is it would allow them to more freely deploy weapons that they've apparently already developed while the U.S only last year began doing research and development for intermediate range weapons remember thousands of weapons of this nature had to be destroyed so it's not like the U.S has stockpiled ready to deploy now\nIs it possible that the ... might be for lack of a better term bluffing right to to get a better deal\nThat could be this is a Soviet era treaty and it limits what the US can do not just in Europe but across the entire planet and proper like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to joined the INS if the U.S started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since the Nineteen seventies the thrust has been to limit nuclear weapon\nAnd Trump would like a deal to include China which right now has no restrictions on deploying intermediate range nuclear weapons they might be pressured to join the either of us started placing such weapons in the south Pacific\nDavid in the meantime the u._s. does have other arms control agreements with Russia or those imperil\nI think this does mark a major shift in us arms control policy since Nineteen seventies the thrust has been to limit nuclear weapons and under Trump the momentum all seems to be toward ending these treaties and letting the stove nuclear arms race get going again\nAfter all this administration has pushed for developing new nuclear weapons and they've been approved by the new defense budget\nThat's NPR's David Welna David thank you for your reporting your commodity\nResidents of the Florida Panhandle are still reeling from the destruction caused by

think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype

you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter than most are the first and
