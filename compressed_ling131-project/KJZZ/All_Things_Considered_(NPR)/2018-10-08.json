say about the justice she'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy\nKennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court most famously on a string of gay rights cases but also for example in reaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John

earthworms by one and a half degrees Celsius which is on track to happen in just about Twenty years\nThe un included data from over six thousand scientific studies\nAnd one of those studies came from the nonprofit think tank climate interactive where Andrew Jones is the cofounder welcome thank you thank you also cylinders just make this clear this report is predicting really the same consequences of climate change that previous reports had been predicting but this report says these consequences will happen sooner yeah\nThat's the basic idea and when I read it for the first time I was struck

gosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatch them Netflix can hear you but if you think about it facing this kind of impossibility is really some extent what humans were made for and the

crackdown\nSince earlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that a reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is

we've got to do something to stop\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites but I haven't done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use\nIts opposition shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia\nIt remains illegal under federal law and people engage in that activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement ... Rosenstein um incorporate or of a safe injection site nonprofit an incumbent arrest me first\nRun del says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely\nRound the gold find with the AIDS project in Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to

all tech considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good an in house a cue or is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just want smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images the when the elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white\nVariable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people\nUh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as real as\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many\nMany images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people have colored yes oh\nThe answer to that question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could uses technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters as someone who\nRace bias that's a harder question so even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could uses technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um\nIs face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University

these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they did they were from page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was
