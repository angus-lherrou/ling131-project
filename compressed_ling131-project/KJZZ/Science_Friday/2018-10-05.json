B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ...\nI'd rather than young it's here and now another ten day this morning that Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court was voted to to a final Florida vote tomorrow that could happen\nAs soon as tomorrow morning but senators can change their vote tomorrow so the drama has been will date a key swing Senator Jeff flake voted yes in today's procedural votes says he will vote yes to the nomination tomorrow in this something big changes\nAnd Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no today so she will again tomorrow telling reporters that Kavanaugh is a good man but not the right man for the court at this time\nAnd right now we're waiting for another key swing senator Maine Republican Susan Collins to make a statement she voted yes to end debate today but may soon say how she actually plans to vote\nTomorrow Collins is going to be speaking on the Senate for momentarily and we will bring that speech to live when it happens but as we wait we're joined in the studio by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow a welcome to both of you Anita what are you expecting and the next few minutes [laughter]\nIf I if I had a crystal ball believe me I would've said what I was expecting before I visited one of those very dramatic moments because if Susan Collins says that she's going to\nWhen it happens but as we wait we're joined in the studio by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow a welcome to both of you Anita what are you expecting and the next few minutes [laughter]\nIf I if I had a crystal ball believe me I would've said what I was expecting before I visited one of those very dramatic moments because if Susan Collins says that she's going to vote no with Lisa Murkowski then everything\nIs on senator Manchin of West Virginia who's a Democrat in a very red state West Virginia and\nI have no idea whether these three people have been consulting each other the way they did actually up ... up until let's say ... a day or two ago but at the time when we were that all the stuff was going on about was they're going to be\nAny sort of an FBI investigation um mansion Collins Murkowski 'em and flake all were in constant touch with each other now the question is Scott Detrow what do you think's going to happen\nBut I think there are a couple indications that that that ... is going to vote for Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thorough unlike Democrats who said that it was woefully short\nAnd the fact that she just had lunch with Mitch McConnell and McConnell apparently emerged with a lunch saying he felt very confident about how the votes going to go he did not look like a leader suddenly scrambling to get this nomination across the finish line\nLike you would want to do either meaner Scott just remind us what's the mass here tomorrow I mean what what have you know what happens if there's a tie ... changes as we said right now it's fifty one forty nine\nTo ... ... what do\nWe look you've got your guy on ... okay\nAh the the Senate is divided fifty one forty nine Republicans at fifty one seats Democrats of forty nine seats uh today's a close\nGet the nomination across the finish line\nReally deal with one of the leading meaner Scott just remind us what's the math here tomorrow I mean what what ... you know what happens if there's a time when a bundle changes as we said right now it's fifty one forty nine\nTo nearly ... ... what are we forgot\nYour guy and he did man okay ah the the Senate is divided fifty one forty nine Republicans at fifty one seats Democrats or forty nine seats uh today's a cloture vote was a party line vote with two exceptions Murkowski hop to the Democrats to vote no mansion hop to the Republicans to vote yes\nSo if there's one more no votes and there was today and it's fifty fifty then vice president Mike Pence comes and breaks the tie which would certainly be unprecedented for a Supreme Court confirmation phones\nScott as you watch this and the decisions that the senators are making\nIt does appear from the outside that their own futures are in their minds more than anything else perhaps that they're thinking about whether this is ... whether it's Joe mansion or whether it's Susan Collins or or others that they're thinking about what it means for them politically coming up in the midterms\nAbsolutely uh Joe Manchin that's the case more than anyone else Joe Manchin is a Democrat running for reelection in West Virginia where President Trump is wildly popular\nHe somebody who supported a Trump last nominee Neil Gorsuch and uh before before the Ford allegations arose look very likely to vote for judge Kavanaugh mansions in a tough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he is\nBecause if he if he votes for cabinet if he helps get Kevin on the on the court as the lone Democrat and a decisive vote\nDemocrats will will blast him and and and maybe abandoned him over the next few weeks but if you have to know then uh then he might lose a lot of support in this day and work in President Trump's\nPopular you guys are looking at pictures outside Susan Collins office right now uh it's packed you know tons of people there and say you you will know they've been people in the ...\nAnd if he helps get cabin on the on the court of the loan Democrat and a decisive vote Democrats will will blast him and and and maybe abandoned him over the next few weeks but if you know then uh then he might have a lot of support and invade where again President Trump's or evolved alert\nYou guys are looking at pictures outside Susan Collins office right now uh it's packed you know tons of people there and of course that you you will know that have been people in the corridors of the capital you know for the last couple of weeks but a huge crowd there now\nI'm just your thought because everybody the same sort of new territory and what happens if the vice president has to break a time\nAnd what what's your thinking about\nKavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh heading towards the Supreme Court potentially and it sounds like you know most likely\nA tie vote them or the owner of the time yeah I'm sure that he and his Mitch McConnell\nWill think that that is better than losing\n'em and that he will go there and people will forget that it was a tie vote or that the vice president broke the tie on\nAnd I I don't actually think that that it may be significant in some historical sense\nBut given the number of rules that have been changed or broken in the last two years to get through first Neil Gorsuch when I'm Republican leader McConnell a lead the fight and it wasn't much of a fight because they had the votes to get rid of the ... the filibuster rules so that\nYou could confirm somebody with a simple majority instead of needing sixty votes so that was the first one then there were all the\nRules that were broken or or\nLong term a customs of consulting senators from states over a lower court judge chips and the Trump White house stopped doing that in many cases\nThe filibuster rules so that you could confirm somebody with a simple majority instead of needing sixty votes so that was the first one then there were all the rules that were broken or ... or\nLong term a customs of consulting senators from states over a lower court judge chips and the Trump White house stopped doing that in many cases and then there were all the rules about the number of people who could be considered at one time that used to be one or two\nAt most in a single hearing now is you know a half dozen two dozen sometimes so when it comes to judge ships\nThe Republicans who have had lockdown control of this process have changed a lot of rules just having the vice president cast the deciding vote I I Would not rank high among them\nWas actually going to ask someone who's seen as a partisan a you know that that a tie had to be broken but also that you have a retired chief justice Stevens come out and say he was against him or you have you know he's someone who I\nThink you tell me I'm like recent nominees actually worked in the political realm in the Bush White House ah was accused of handling other controversial nominations of judges William prior and Charles Pickering and saying he wasn't involved in an email showed he was involved\nI'm going to have to ask you to hold that thought because I think\nWe will says ma'am sergeant armed forces stand until this [noise] ... store order and the gallery [noise]\nSergeant [noise]\n\nObviously I we I think we're seeing Susan Collins about to announce a decision is on the floor but there were protesters on the floor [noise]\n\n... order and the gallery [noise] ... [noise]\n\nObviously I think we're seeing Susan Collins about to announce it she's on the floor but there were protesters on the floor for [noise]\n\nAs [noise]\nAs a reminder to our gas and the galleries expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted and it's not like ours sooner four main\nMr President Mr precedence the side ... previous times that I've come\nTo the floor to explain my vote on the nomination adjusted to the United States Supreme court [noise]\nI have the gun my floor remarks explaining my decision with her recognition of the Solomon nature and the importance of the occasion\nBut today we have come to the conclusion ... the confirmation process\nThat has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature up I got her level political campaign than a solemn occasion the president nominated bread cabinet\nOn July none within moments that announcement special interest groups raised to be the first two oppose and including one organization that didn't even bother to fail and the judges name\nAnd it's ... press release\nThe president nominated Brett Kavanaugh\nOn July none within moments of that announcement special interest groups raised to be the first to oppose him including one organization that didn't even bother to fail and the judges name\nOn it's pre red and press release\nThey simply throw\nThat they opposed Donald Trump's nomination up acts acts to the Supreme Court of the United states\nA number of senators joined the race to announce their opposition but they were beaten to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition before the nominees identity was see even know\nIn President Bush's White House rule that the conviction was some last fall\nAs he explained during the hearing quote we\nDo make decisions based on who people are\nOr their policy preferences or at the moment we base decisions on the law\nAnd quote\nOther sides met with have expressed concerns said Justice Kennedy's retirement threatens the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh\nDescribed the overcooked pals decision which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark\nHe also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece cage cakes shop opinion for the court's majority stating that quote\nThe days of treating gay and lesbian Americans are gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens who are in theory or in dignity and\nWords are over in the Supreme Court and quote\nOthers have suggested that the judge holds the extreme views some birth control in one case judge Kavanaugh encourage the does favor or both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in article three\nOf our constitution itself he believes set precedent it's not just the judicial policy it's constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay he two roles of precedent\nIn other words precedent infant a goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tenant that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances\nThe judge further explain that presidents provide stability predictability reliance and fairness\nThere are of course rare an extraordinary times where the Supreme Court which rightly overturn a precedence the most famous example was when the Supreme Court in brown versus the board of education\nOver rules plastic versus port Ferguson\nCorrecting a gravy asleep wrong decision to use the judges term allowing racial inequality\nBut someone who believe that the importance of precedent has been rooted in the constitution would follow long established precedent except in those rare circumstances\nWhere a decision is gravy asleep wrong or deeply inconsistent with the law does\nOur judge Kavanaugh's phrased it\nAs the judge just started to me a long established precedent it's not something to be true\nWould follow longest established precedent except in those rare circumstances where a decision is gravy asleep wrong or deeply inconsistent with the law does our judge Kavanaugh's praised the\nAs the judge just started to me a long established precedent it's not something to be trimmed narrowed discarded or Oprah lost\nIts roots in the constitution gives the concept of starry just sites is greater way such that the president can't be trimmed or narrowed simply because the judge might want to on a whim\nEnsured his views on honoring precedence would priests clued a chance to do by stealth bats which one has committed not to do over like\nNoting that roe v Wade was decided forty years forty five years ago and reaffirmed nice teen years later and Planned Parenthood versus Casey\nI asked judge cabin up whether the passage of\nTime is relevant to following president he said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and fed honoring precedent it's essential to maintaining public confidence\nOur discussion Ben turn to the right to privacy on which the Supreme Court relied in Griswold versus Connecticut case that struck

Supreme Court relied in Griswold versus Connecticut a case that struck down the law banning the use and sale of contraception\nGriswold tablets the legal foundations that led to grow eight years later\nIn just griping Britain's falls as settled law judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application of two famous cases from the Nineteen twenties\nMeyer and peers better not seriously challenged by anyone today\nFinally in his testimony he noted repeatedly row had been upheld by Planned Parenthood versus Casey describing it as precedent unprecedented\nWhen I asked him what is it ... ... ... over turned up long established precedent if five current justices believed that it was wrongly decided he and ... said no\nOpponents frequently sites then candidate Donald Trump's campaign pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn roe\nThe Republican platform for all presidential campaign has included this pledge since at least Nineteen eighty\nDuring this time presidents Republican presidents have appointed justices so Connor suitor and Kennedy to the Supreme Court the start that very three justices Republican president\nCan't pay has included this pledge since at least Nineteen eighty\nDuring this time presidents Republican presidents have appointed justices O'Connor suitor and Kennedy to the Supreme Court the start that very three justices Republican

by and with the slogan and stopped sued or or women will die\nJust two years later Justice Souter coauthored the Casey opinion reaffirming a woman's right to choose suffice it to say prominence advocacy organizations have been wrong\nThe same interest groups have speculated that judge Kavanaugh was selected to do the bidding up conservative idiom lives despite his record of judicial independence\nI asked the judge point blank whether he had made any ... Mad Men or pledges to anyone at the White House to the federalist society to any outside group\nOn how he would decide cases he unequivocal like assured me that he had not\nJudge Kavanaugh has

that his integrity judicial temperament of professional confidence met the highest standards\nLisa Black who is argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman in history testified quote by any objective measure judge Kavanaugh it's clearly\nTo the contrary if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process\nIt has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the PR face the ... of this terrible\nProblem I have\nBeen on my arms and disturbed however by some who have suggested that in last judge Kavanaugh's nomination it's rejected the Senate is somehow can Joan and sexual assault\nNothing could be further from the true every person man or woman\nMake such charge of sexual assault deserves to be heard and treated with respect me too movement is real\nIt matters it is needed and did it's long overdue we know that rape and sexual assault or less likely to be reported to the police\nWho makes such hardships sexual assault deserves to be heard and treated with respect the me too movement is real\nIt matters is needed and did is long overdue we know that rape and sexual assault or less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault\nOn average an estimated two hundred eleven balance and rape and sexual assaults go unreported every year\nWe must listen to survivors and every day we must see to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many we all this to ourselves our children and the generations to come\nSince the here and I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault\nMany were total strangers who told me their heart wrenching stories for the first time in their lives\nSome of our friends that I had known for decades you have with the exception of one woman who has confided to me years ago I had no idea that they had been the victims of sexual attack\nI Am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward\nAnd I hope that in heightening public awareness they have also lighten the burden that they have been quietly bearing for so many years\nOf sexual attack\nI Am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward\nAnd I hope that in heightening public awareness they have also lighten the burden that they have been quietly bearing for so many years\nTo them I pledge to do all that I can to ensure that their daughters and granddaughters never share their experiences\nOver the past few weeks I offend emphatic that the Senate has an obligation to investigate and the value of way the serious allegations of sexual assault\nI called for and support is the additional hearing to hear from both professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nI also push for and supported the FBI supplemental background investigation this was

yet that letter found its way into the public domain she testified that she never gave permission for that very private letter to be related and yet here we are\nWe are in the middle of a fight that she never fought side arguing about claims that she wanted to raise confidentially\nNow one theory I heard his spouse repeatedly is that our colleagues Senator Feinstein lead professor Ford's letter at the eleventh hour to derail this process I wanted states this very clearly\nI Know\nSenator Dianne Feinstein extremely well and I believe that she would never do that I knew that should be the case before she even stated it at the here and she is a person of integrity and I stand by\nI've also heard some argue that the chairman of the committees somehow treated professor Ford unfairly nothing
