this worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind this uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies and what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally\nAlso what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number ... for for seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that a Lancet series he's also professor of midwife midwifery\nAt the Yale School of nursing\nThank you for joining us today alec enemy thank you\nTell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries an overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions that must have buried around the world [noise] well it does\nAn author author on that lasted Siri she's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us today alec enemy thank you\nTell us alliances series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have varied around the world\n[noise] well it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over U C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous his um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um\nAccess and a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using at the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nLast talking about over by\nToo much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um don't have enough to access probably are under using at the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nOver last talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted normative part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise]\nExactly and again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this is Erin and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... says area and is not a low risk a surgery it is it's a major surgery ends and things are\nThere are small bit serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth later with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough water\nUh there are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth later with um subsequent pregnancies and that's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states who are increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nWhy they're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when women really needs it and I think it's important to to stay at at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she

Holly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing director Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous ... Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there\nDr Holly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or Tony go and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous for Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach here compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nIt it it uh differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out the W. World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp on us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on ... a very extensive review of the evidence and they found that mid with free was as so said with improved outcomes increasing including\nDecreasing C sections and so one is what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives\nThe state was in a regulation um in reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent twenty six percent of birth or attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and\nIf you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst and the turtle an infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it is an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\nWell first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well and then the last obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine\nOh we monitor fetuses um while women are and labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that in no weather area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science in objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really try to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definitions for progress in labor a old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and um and do the as him for ... back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke your ... or do if you were always from so blown down here in Boston so does this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital\nTo the next event separated by one or two miles from one another who take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nGo to determines moralistic you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ... percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever Toledo that's relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report\nHow it will be a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level the playing field in in any in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one\nIf I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time or
