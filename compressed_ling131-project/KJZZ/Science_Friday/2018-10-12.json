cousins of ours right here on earth analyzing their communications the structures of their societies\nAnd their brainy waves that they navigate their world as my next guest says the neatest stone assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks\nWelcome to science friday I think it's great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood\nAs one of the first animals that went into space wow what got you fascinated with study scores so\nI'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazonian Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild [noise]\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow a movie show how many do you study how many of the group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nAnd do do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names\nThey're very challenging [noise] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow a movie show how many do you study how many of the group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor two or three groups regularly\nAnd I do do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names like you keep track of them\nSome ... square one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them I'm particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar\nBut there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality or yeah they do stand out okay give me a typical day in the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nOkay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spent a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nAh they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time foraging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their practice yeah or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grass\nRats but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter] um and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we followed them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\n... for their practice or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes\nAnd they seem very happy while they're doing it wow\n[laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a ... a wasp mess right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is they will approach a ... a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low and once the adult lost desert the ness\nThe adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that ... left abandoned in the nest\nWow for their pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient and patient [laughter] those Watson are leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of ... of of\nThe adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] it was once we're not leaving so far right yeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of of of of the other one of the spider ... let's let's hear that clip\n[noise]\nOur score a monkey or spider monkey everybody does that ever is that right yeah yeah it was okay tell us when we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I Can't recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver yeah um but when there's you know ten of them in a tree it's kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\n... we have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious mhm\n[noise]\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there's an adult male at least in there making one of the noises\n[noise]\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we'd hear in the wild um my guess is that there was an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies of jungles or you know that that ... that we hear is that right there there's usually does it does a squirrel monkeys and we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because we're monkey sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of square monkeys instead of\nBird and how hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference and to study this sounds very me\nSo it's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys\nUm you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant he's\nThe monkey whisper and knows everything about square monkeys and so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nHow long have you been doing it for a little longer\nHe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well the caller yes sometimes he does he like he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about human life\nSquare monkey then so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nAnd how long have you been doing that for a little longer\nHe started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing for about Twenty years\nThe monkey whisper yeah well the caller yes sometimes he does he like he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about human language for evolution of our language from from studying them the squirrel monkey\nSo um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nAnd um the idea here is that you can try to understand the evolution of human language so the idea that humans started living in social groups that we're increasingly large and so the manual grooming sort of the the kind we seen bad dunes in ...\nBecame less less feasible really and so the ideas that humans would have invented an alternative form of grooming vocal grooming so it would be a way to maintain contact in social bonds with their their friends\nKj is easy is supported\nBy cancer treatment centers of America expanding

must win back to the coast to one very particular river mouth\nAnd then retreat miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they weren't born enemy do this well like\nAny good trip you need a map and not just the compost just showing you where north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight nor the\nRiver mouth and then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like in\nAny good trip you need a map and not just the compost is just telling you where north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north ... and more north east east and south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded\nThat what if they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect\nThe magnetic field lines of the year ... is there magnetic and what about their land to dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked lives you know lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that map\nHere to explain Moore's Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me you know I just I just said it but but sandman live impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles do their journeys take\nThat this pretty impressive and their journeys can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\n... and and they usually ... these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream may have to find the right stream to go how does he do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\nYou know the sad thing and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally with their sense of smell but in terms of the oceanic journey than voyages\nHave to find the right stream to go how does he do this and they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in the ...\nThe same and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reached streams are they generally would use their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages they use something more broad scale and in this term we think they're using magnetic maps and magnetic information\n... now you know do your research is looking at a different group of salmon be lapped examine what what makes them so interesting to you\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants\nOf individuals that were transferred from a landlocked lake\nIn Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish had never had access to the Pacific ocean and have never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\n... and ... and yet you found that they still have these Jew magnetic maps in them that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and and how were they able to retain these and why\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math and so the earth's magnetic\nField has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as my dad field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator\nAspect of the field that they can use is called uh\nThey can use different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math and so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field\nOr also known as magnetic field intensity and so those intensities are stronger at the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect\nOf the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth and so they're steeper toward the pools and shallower at the equator\nAnd both of these components predict or favorably are predictably variable across the surface of the globe so it's super convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel\nSo they form a type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do them\nSo they're the mechanisms behind magna Utah reception are are still unclear but it's one of the leading hypotheses is that a\nSalmon and other species\nHave tiny chains of magnet tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields\nAnd so changes in both the field strings and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nSo these structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the men need a receptor itself a is still\n... and the thought is that these chains can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields and so changes in both the field strengths and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials so these structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance all along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nMhm now why why important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these few\nWell it's a rather interesting question that we wanted to know whether landlocked numbers of species that\nCould go to the ocean retain a map sense just to a point of curiosity and\nWe also wanted to know or if it lent examine\nAlso possess disability it's another group of individuals that does ethnic maps of diverse amount of no amounts of species but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic environments\nOne can they even detect a magnetic field but to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nMhm and so how did you go about testing research\nSo the eggs from [noise] the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were ... and subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coils and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct\nOf that electricity is a magnetic field\nOf where they were retired and subsequently tested and so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coils and essentially it's a series of wouldn't frames that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply and crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to\nAlter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\n... so what you're doing I Know for my basic physics you know in grade school of if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental\nIn a certain direction so that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction\nIf that were present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact\nWith what we think are these tiny chains of NATO type rights that somehow connect with an herself\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this\nSo we evaluate the movement fish movement by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos\nOf our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nWow that's terrific\nAnd then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials so what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos\nOf our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fish is head relative to magnetic north\nWow\nThat's terrific and and you know um do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields\nThat is a question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale to maintain a resolution those maps is yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of ... of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look I made a magnetic resolution of this map so having a series of points moving them closer and closer together and to see how finer core scale their responses actually are\nMhm so uh could you save endangered salmon man by knowing more about them\nI mean it always helps to know more information about us bases that you're trying to conserve them knowing how they're making movement decisions would certainly be helpful and", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "12"}
