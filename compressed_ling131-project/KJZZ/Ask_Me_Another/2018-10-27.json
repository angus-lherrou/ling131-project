[noise]\nEven welcome thank you for having me so exciting to have you here so let's start from the beginning of your spongebob journey yes\nVerify with me where you were and what you were doing when you received the information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants\nI was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah go Vassar brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a plush sponge Bob Dole that lived on that being back here so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call\nAnd it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet\nReally randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer and they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the title to Atlanta project but we think you might be the right shape for it\nYeah that hurt I when I heard a little bit\nThe phone call and it was a casting director who had just seen me

it's the title teen Atlanta project but we think you might be the right shape for it [noise]\nUm [noise] yeah that hurt I won't hurt a little\nBit but I've gotten over it but you didn't know what they were talking about it oh no they they said the the name of chipper chip and just to work at a send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm with the guys I got this audition how cool is going to be a [noise]\nAnd like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob do in the hands I like looked at the doll and I looked at the poster and I looked at my friends and I was like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob [laughter] [noise]\nUm that is a crazy coincidence it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive high pitched kind of get ugly voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right yeah that was like both\nI'm a conscious decision as an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure ah I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me\nSo I stayed up you know working on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice it's pretty important\n[laughter]\nFor cocoa cocoa yes he says you're\nMorning on the quad and I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice it's pretty important [laughter]\nCool for cocoa cocoa\nYes he says you're you are studying at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and\nJuliet did you know yeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah and I had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision because they were like well you got you know two weeks of his workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I I've been doing to Shakespeare show since I was a little kid in D. C. and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and he said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it\nSo I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious pass [laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now\nRight now is moments so this show is\nIncredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics you were jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training and it's this five years you've been already has shown me up on six wow\nBut yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of those six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um\nGymnastics were jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training and it's this five years you've been ... showing up on six wow\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of those six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got caught and um I learned was great yeah the ... right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um\nYeah and yeah when you see the show you do this incredible back then that makes everyone gas\nYeah that's the thing that I can I get thank you to a you know John

spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it has made you a more optimistic person hopefully we totally yeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privilege of you know being the sponge\nTwo and a half hours it shows a week um when did you first notice this I don't I don't know it's\nBeen a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yes and like at first I was like [noise] no\nUm but yeah I mean like\nAnd and I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around everyone people tend to\nAnd and I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he
