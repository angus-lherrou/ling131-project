Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact be state legislative seats even more because\nHeard the president and his predictions of a red wave at what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just gonna maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin are two states that are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races in\nA lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities\nBoth of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave chased a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers somebody's governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here if the elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank

from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke Garcia Navarro head of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival Beto O'Rourke has long used\nTo live with\nBut Cruz himself hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nOr your name is Raphael you know you go by cared that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nJust this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters tribal leaders\nSelf hasn't escaped scrutiny here from preschool now on CNN\nWhat's your name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for cleaning native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we can overuse identity that we can\nBring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political context I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best view on on the ground so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role that an identity in politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co opting\nI think they need I I Would say\nIt was that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who is best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly gasoline\nI I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down the terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel shed hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings in the very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a a real concern that identity and and the politics around it it has been weaponized and and it certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that where more divided around identities than we are around policy\nAnd let from re vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order to run the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a a real note of concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nYou know I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is no coming together but losing losing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nIf the other question is whether you could do that with our ... you go rightly weaponized identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lives that
