battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan ... columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian balls before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh wars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than look to possible\nThat they she confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nThey should confirmed me 'cause I think

is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all and make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that is actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and then it had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen to shoot\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this other not with Kevin ... name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee

had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\nFoot ... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's energy from Christine Blasey Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my cupboards the whole time there really is there were two talking points in the U.S neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going

standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise] um it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a

though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious and possibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty\nMillion or so ... when when Donald Trump ... over the years I built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is\nTrump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches I think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really late ... and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognizing that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\n[noise] [noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of

honestly not super surprising\nYeah well yeah that it's been indicated also I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made the senator mentioned is just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that mostly most people supported cabinet here however uh I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for re election in thirty days and he he has under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician or the that's not much of a surprise visit to I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did get

the Senate goes we it he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had a because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done a terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of\nThe opioid

he's got Trump's endorsement and uh he's just a bad guy and I think he knows the Democrat\n... camp though this is old your opinion with me underscore this is my\n... do of course this is my opinion yes of course um so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue yeah\nSo we're working on um

time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and\nLast night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red

assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views [laughter] which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian policy for it now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] I'm wars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it than look to possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowd I wasn't aware of that because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this other not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapist notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian buzz you forward a sincere a book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have\nIs that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses who contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let a church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally\nAnd Harry with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n[noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the

Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily their head or of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious and possibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump passed on several hundred million dollars to his children he could do so\nId of tax shelters are a number which were perfectly legal others which were dubious and possibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald Trump ... over the years I built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n... is there anything that you did you can recognize that maybe people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly\nOn his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story

pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company it was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nIn traffic on your sixties grounded
