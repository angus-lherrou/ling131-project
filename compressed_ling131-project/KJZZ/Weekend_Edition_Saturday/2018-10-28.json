assault style rifle we're told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil like in a loving people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades yeah\nAnd we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um I went to the scene\nThis morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to to\nEarlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think a point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people are grappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding yeah what are\nThey mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happened so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help stay I'm lease\nWorship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place it's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's\nUm and ... and so uh that's just one small thing that community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nIncredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far [noise]\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nUm it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the synagogue the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks worth noting that the death penalty is still on the books in in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been uh\nRemarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the synagogue the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorse noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years thing of Texas that actively carry out that's sentences but unless the president is is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal um relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it uh what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nNeeds to to Asian than and I I've not been on the ground here if it's for too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is a ...\nThink it needs to to Asian than and I I've not been on the ground here if it's for too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the love right is shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for a crime so they can prosecute investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community and in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives that\nTells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but uh it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as\nA press conference get started pretty

in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida mourning mourning [noise]\nAll right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate on Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here are there any\nShould be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year it's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent

yet\nDeborah gradient was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWhich satellites handler he loves Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk\nIn politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this\nBlack voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nWhite is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now [noise]\nRight in front of that statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why put our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles so when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was\nDid very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist\nMeans we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how\nDid those two things then said when you're trying to discuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\nDetroit the on an off ramp greenway\nOr consider alternate routes like taking the fifty one north to the one oh one west\n... supported by

terrible shooting in Pittsburgh bombs in the mail this is a fraud political moment and here to help us make sense of it as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson this morning thanks for having me [noise]\nSo obviously I'm a terrible news out of Pittsburgh we got the names of those who I'm actually were killed by this in this attack\nYeah let's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the presidents in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this but the president has\nMade a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil he has also gone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did\nBut just before\nA rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it and I have a much different Joan frankly the press was\nEven handed grocery sphere I'd have a much different out all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault\nBut as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of ...\nAnd I'd have a much different John frankly if the press was\nEven handed Russia was fair I'd have a much different out all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault but as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there is what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\n... this is a president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief\nNo he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation but he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energizes his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race in fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms that YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away will the events of this past week affects the elections and if so how I think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away will eventually this past week affects the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in\nThe house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect the elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were honor roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs so that might be the biggest effect\nNPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you\nThis morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case he's or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning well All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did it\nPlea for these five federal charges he faces and then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that put the nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\n[noise] yeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrest but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nThat's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the

the mid term election season we've been looking at what voters will find on their ballots the big governors' races the different kinds of ballot measures well we've just got today and one more Sunday

good morning ...\nA third of the seats in the Senate or up as the constitution requires Democrats were facing some tough mass but then we started hearing about a blue wave how's that water looking\nWell look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house than in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more uh seats that are held by Democrats in red states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending ... seats and just nine\nHow's that water looking well look the blue wave is certainly real but it's more likely to be in the house than in the Senate and that's because in the Senate there are a lot more uh seats that are held by Democrats in red or states that are up you have the worst landscape since the direct election of senators\nIn Nineteen fourteen for either party that's because you have twenty six Democrats that are defending seats and just nine Republicans so will the Republicans pick up seats then\nIt's very possible in fact a you know some handicappers are looking at a potential a best case scenario for Democrats being net even right now it's fifty one forty nine in the Senate\nAnd a more likely scenario something like two to three seats lost from when I talk to Democrats at the beginning of the cycle and through the cycle they were hoping to sort of be able to hold serve so that they could have a better landscaping twenty Eighteen where they could go on often\nThe best target for Democrats as in Nevada with Dean Heller and Heller is actually started to do a lot better a lot of those Republican a defense is a lot of those those Senate seats or Arizona Tennessee Texas

having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity in politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this\nBlack voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default\nSo I have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering why\nThat that's also not true yeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about like people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why put our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics Oh absolutely\nToward the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist\nMeans we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then said when you're trying to\nDiscuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\nWhen I was clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very Larry clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally what voters on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic ...\nUh the election showed that biased to be very Larry clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally ... voted on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it\nIt's it's economic anxiety so that's biased but also when we talk about fairness is it fair\nIs it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment of those voters were white\nTo me that is not fair it's not fair to all of the people in a country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and our coverage\nNicole Anna Jones of the New York times magazine thank you so much thank you very much for having me\nThe final season of the Netflix political drama house of cards debuts on friday and it's
