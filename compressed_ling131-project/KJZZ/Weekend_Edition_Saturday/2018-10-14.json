powered generator until utility crews to fix all the downfall and wires and restored their electricity fake county emergency services chief mark Bowe\nAnd says that will be a long slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says Scott parents and that the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do restoration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and you're right it can actually be much more ... and take\nFor

it's time to ... and an overhead wire\n... as in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grades more resilient\nOne thing McNamara would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries at places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we also need to be the ... of ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population it keep the lights on even if the project staff\nMcNamara was lead author of a twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change that's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries\nJeff Brady NPR News\nHit the panhandle just as the voter

Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago you see a lotta storms come through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now they're just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all\nOf the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once can flush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson and a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Ron dissent is a former congressman\nWho also has a lot of support and pockets of a Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been to a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here after\nScott led the state\nDeporting pockets of Florida you\nKnow what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likeliest scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise about eight percentage points and then it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over well both physically in these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcasts on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee\nThe mayor but it was pretty hard it was hit yeah a ... in Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as a Mexico beach right in the uh the\nOf Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent round the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her mean this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly\nIn in one case actually chain sewing trees away\nCounty which is where ... space shuttle had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum buys poet run the Centers for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly\nIn in one case actually chainsaw in trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really show he's changed on your trees [laughter] he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who is just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone thought to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen ah what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they are going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle it'd be almost impossible pull right

Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats

really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's gonna be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt um\nNevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that

not just where we're going to do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why

beach looks now if there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd then all of the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped

Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat and ... is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it couldn't name and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been to a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise\nBy ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally risk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo she has been kind of all over ah both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in\nTallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott as governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far that Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he was an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee\nBut it was hit pretty hard it was hit yeah uh\nWith Governor Jeb Bush and Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit\nOf the city of Tallahassee mayor but it was hit pretty hard it was hit yeah a ... Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as a Mexico beach right in the ... the county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the Centers for his leadership during a storm hurricane her mean\nThis time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly in in one case actually changed showing trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really show he's changed on your trees [laughter] well he's he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to

chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to drop congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats

is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four
