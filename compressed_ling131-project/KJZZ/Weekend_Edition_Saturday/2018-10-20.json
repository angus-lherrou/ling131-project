I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they can get to a big deal\nAnd I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nA Howard thank here in San Francisco uh their commemorating fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John

HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers deliver to the infant and risk transferring HIV or but the child grow sicker and most likely die\nChild received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV\nThe surgery is your first and could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa we're about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world\nDr Harriet Etheridge is a medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and she was part of the team of doctors who help prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much had any ... how's the baby doing\nAnd the baby's doing very very well we are very yeah after the ... now\nAnd to see this child died in driving under these circumstances with this world famous case is obviously enormous they got to find and it really makes us feel good about the decision we may well help\nUs understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't hear\nYeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child\nComes dances with this world famous case is obviously enormously gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWon't help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors to me\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three during the surgery we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for a living during a for three times the average\nAnd this child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us why ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy when you consider us so they were sick need that wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the Darnah that she could be a Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote sending Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from the very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the lives of their child\nTo grow through juice in this uh this case the more people know about it we'll look contribute something to lifting the stigma that they try to be in so many countries around the world\nWould like to her so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted says I from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national aids treatment\nDo you think this uh this case the more people know about it we'll look contribute something to lifting the stigma of HIV in Germany countries around the world\nI Would like to hope so you know HIV sticking there is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted says the U.S in South Africa although we have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive tests and and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that shouldn't ... from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent and HIV stigma\nDuck harried

you helped bring this about [noise]\nYes Judy Shepard a called me and said you know we're coming up on the twentieth anniversary of Matt's death and we've never buried his ashes I actually didn't know that and uh she said we're thinking it's time someone said perhaps\nThe national cathedral would be a good and appropriate place\nI think they're real concern was that it not be in a place where mats grave could be desecrated in some way and you certainly can't blame them for being protective of their son after what happened to him and so uh I worked with the national cathedral and indeed\nIts time someone said perhaps\nThe national cathedral would be a good and appropriate place\nI think they're a real concern was that it not be in a place where mats grave could be desecrated in some way and you certainly can't blame them for being protective of their son after what happened to him\nAnd so uh I worked with the national cathedral and indeed that's where ... will finally rest and I think it will\nBring a certain sense of safety as well as closure for the shepherd's who who really turned vis vis a act of violence\nInto an amazing campaign on behalf of gay and lesbian bisexual and transgender a young people everywhere\nAnd what do you hope the size of his remains will be for a lot of people\nAt least for the next several decades I'm hoping it will do two things one is is to help people to remember that we all have a tendency to make people who are different from ourselves or the other\nAnd then to do terrible things to them and it's important that the the hate crimes bill that was finally passed is named both for Matthew Shepard and for James Byrd the um African American who was dragged behind a truck until he died\nBecause it it links all the marginalized groups who experienced violence against them\nAnd the second thing I Hope is that it will be a constant reminder\nThat this work isn't done I'm more than eight out of ten students in in our schools here in America report bullying and harassment over eight out of ten that's as of last year so we're not talking about things that happened only Twenty years ago\nThem and the second thing I Hope is that it will be a constant reminder\nThat this work isn't done I'm more than eight out of ten students in in our schools here in America report bullying and harassment over eight out of ten that's as of last year so we're not talking about\nThings that happened only Twenty years ago but actually continue to happen would would you hope that a young\nMan or young woman who was wrestling but some of these issues would be able to to walk into the national cathedral and feel at home and ...\n... let's remember the church\nHas been the source of much if not even most of the paying algae B. T. people have faced I'm the condemnation that has traditionally come down from um Christian churches\nHas cast us in such a negative light that these three fellows who who beat Matthew Shepard to death they felt I'm okay how about that they felt justified about that and for Matthew\nTo come home to the Episcopal Church which he was a part\nAnd for the algae Beatty community far and wide to do see a church welcoming him to rest there in the cathedral forever is a huge statement and I'm proud to be associated with it you know who he will be resting near\nWell I Do know that in the crypt in addition to Woodrow Wilson\nAh is Helen Keller and her teacher and Sullivan and uh I think that is the perfect place for Matthew\nA great teacher and or someone like Helen Keller who told us all the luck\nAnd thanks to match parents' we've all been moved to action uh and I think in some ways our Hatteras\nKnow that in the crept in addition to Woodrow Wilson is Helen Keller and her teacher and Sullivan and uh I think that is the perfect place for Matthew\nA great teacher and uh some when like Helen Keller who told us all the luck\nAnd thanks to match parents' we've all been moved to action
