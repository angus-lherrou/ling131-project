problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe is missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter

to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to

concerned about that what is the complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really

which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I'd really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse\nAs far as religion goes I I Believe in most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think

Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report [noise]\nBecause I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd never been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic

this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it

forward to it that my mother's ... incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a rider we

my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut they're right on the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not\nMake much money she was dealing with what I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten she started to uh what\nMe when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just things started to give progressive Lee worst and\nI think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to give her aggressively worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world in our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June dirt from your mother the beatings that she endured\nI think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the beat in June to or from your mother the ... the she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I think led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nEnding eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like I'm going to push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police\nUs about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to\nThe starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body pushing my body pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept it up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every cent that are made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about they're harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim and one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi and so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there is a shame when we show people and tell people that\nThe money that we are able to make we are unable to cheap right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that to our feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse\nWhen I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely like trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher and my mother and not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes\nThat reading and writing can say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nHere say lemon his book heavy than

like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a high Finn or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens

right you have\nThere is just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration lists but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting you know\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under camps office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office says you know this

this um she said everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side ... campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis\nBut for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all

what is the situation seem like today\nWell as you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations do have gas there very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it's getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which is like there\nIt's a small city about thirty seven thousand residents 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico it's not all the jury's town I mean the houses are set pretty close together\nAnd right now it's like every block is is that almost like a scene from a disaster movie like there are trees down there

from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your faith which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion and then I didn't learn honestly until ...\nNot far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about you know priests molesting kids and whatnot but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd never been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church\nI don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell\nNo I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was\nClose with do you think the church cared more about it shelters institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops in people whose names are plastered up on church buildings back in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering\nSeems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops and people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse that was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in\nPreserving their own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of of of these news stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I\nStill have a faith and I just see much less of the connection between my personal faith and the Catholic Church\n...

creative writing at the University of Mississippi joins us now from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us\nThank you so much for wanting to talk to you\nWhen someone says do you tell me about your mother it's not a simple question is it\nOr not at all not at I look forward to it to my mother's ... incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut they're right on the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local telephone\nThink she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not\nMake much money she was dealing with what I Would call like shards of abuse\nAnd you know when I was around nine or ten she started to uh what me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police white people would be even a harsher and those beatings just things started to give progressive Lee worst and\nI think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the NGO endured from your mother the beatings that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOf the things I just I just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing costs just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers\nOf particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I thing led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying\nWhat happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I think led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of\nReally big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em and individually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police us about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nMan I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not asleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make we are unable to cheap\nRight and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely like trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and um\nMy family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment\nComing full circle she really believes that reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and try to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nHere say lemon his book heavy and American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for having me\n\nWhen George ... is a star in the Indiana
