spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\nWell it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negatives but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority\nIt might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ...\nYes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter so much of the season on through\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say see\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape a negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\n[noise] what are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter so just the season haunt you\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being\nConnected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric and public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is that an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it has a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who's co director

Dodgers Walker bealer regattas a dealer dealers [laughter] my God he was a brilliant\nThis was two games you know literally was tonight in and games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star or he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit\nWalker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning to can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker bealer being the start\nAnd then I does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win ...\nThat's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game LA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that

week federal prosecutors um shield a criminal complaint\nIntegrated partnerships collaboratively providing legal services for more than a century forty three offices five continents serving clients says one from worldwide learn more at Jones Day dot com and from the listeners to support this NPR station\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon last week federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint which described effort by the Russian backed Internet research agency to use Twitter budge to influence Americans in a wide variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew bitten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing trolls have had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem to beat and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthems\nWell at first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at\nWe're sowing discord this issue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nDid you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected\nAs it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head would be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement\nThen we saw these issues sparked to life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that breakdown wonder how that influenced the conversation\nAnd so it it it wasn't directed achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught contentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you\nYou being a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track to this debate\nOr I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed direct\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me

the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't CNN the political or these days it's not negative it might just\nWatching the wrong spaces [laughter]\nBut it is now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael Franz she teaches\nPolitical science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us my pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political at these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\nYes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in midterm campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to\nThere are getting ... yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns\nFor younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content on line\nAnd there's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer diseases and haunt you\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition\nIn ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric and public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and the fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high political advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it has a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also is\nThat uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is that an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say it has a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who's co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and it's where all weekend edition

all of it well kind of all of that I watched\nUm you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen through Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was an absolutely riveting and and stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton courage Shaw arguably the best pitcher on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter it isn't even throw the ball or does is anybody left to throw the game tonight [laughter] well the Dodgers have\nNamed starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex Cora still hadn't decided who he's starting later today and game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and uh the Dodgers Walker bealer we got a dealer dealers [laughter] if I was a brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no team has ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker Mueller being the start\nOf the night does not LA now have anything left in the town\nKnow no teams ever come back in the world series from a three hour deficit Walker below goes at

given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker Mueller being the start of the night\nDoes not LA now have anything left in the tank to win\n... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into game for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the
