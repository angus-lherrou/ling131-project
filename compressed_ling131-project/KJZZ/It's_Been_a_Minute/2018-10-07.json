cameras on and said\nOh well it's also a PR ploy you know they've had some critique of their business practices how they treat employees they've had some critique over the fact that Jeff Bezos is so rich while their employees are making some eleven dollars an hour is this the thing that Amazon had to do for some good PR as well\nI think the PR that convenience or element to this to give you an example Senator Bernie Sanders has spent many years battling for a higher wages for minimum wage workers\nAnd hatch and fighting Amazon like he's been coming out for a while now produced a bill that's called stop basis act out you know that know how to fit [laughter]\nYeah and on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's yes PR is definitely part of it and another really\nHuge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they ... they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bump in um coverage of that I'm sure

I asked them about their homecoming story or the your average teenagers in the high school band ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nI worked was hiding in a corner on your band

years into Clemens high school in shirts for too you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond fond\nFont thoughts of my days\nHiding in the corner we\nActually played jets and at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah the Syrian story there are couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\n... the opportunity to win together\nOr we didn't have to be together but\nI mean we didn't even have the chance for at least originally we did it\nOf my days hiding in the corner and we actually\nPlay jets and at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah sodium story there are a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\nWe just want to say just one of the opportunity to win together\nOr we didn't have to win together but\nI mean we didn't even have the chance for at least originally we did it\nSo you want it to run on the homecoming court as again but this will administration told her that only boys can be teens and only girls can be queens\nCivilian story said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually change the rules that same day they decided to have no gender titles in the homecoming contests no canes know queens\nEveryone on the homecoming court would just be known as quote royals but that didn't make the soda and story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just the day and that well it shouldn't have ... ... ... they should have just made it so you are voting friction equal regardless of gender ... church whether or not they were now that the king\nQueen or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to that school can say we're going to take out come on circuit check out check your guest what couple wants to run together\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae be teach you plus since the change the soda in story happened dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nWell once you get there\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as el GB teach you plus since the change of sodium story happened dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they said that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new\nPolicy it isn't what home coming as post ... about um outside Austin you order hearing about it the common core ... they're not a very positive what's been the worst kind of comments\nThat originally ... saying that were that were that were snowflakes rational or special treatment and that this is exactly what they would have expected added\nElecting a check up or is that they were really how come perfect yeah\nPeople really think is going to ruin homecoming\nMovie and it up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well like is there going to be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next Hi\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that has been talking to us throughout this whole issue mentioned like offhand ... she was like and I can't wait for all we get to Prague either they\nUsed to be running for prom king and queen ... now my goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done he has some please [laughter]\nActually that one of the teachers that has been talking to us about this whole issue that you write off ... she was but and\nCan't wait for which we get the wrong they\nSay in ... and how that turned out oh my goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done he believes [noise]\nIt'd be sued on women facility and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support them others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story really made me think\nLike Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have this school administration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some\nI I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older\nUs why why my grand prize of nothing not even a crispy cream that might be around your\n[noise] with that um

your family Thanksgiving inspired this and all it actually did a it was right the Thanksgiving right after the twenty sixteen election I was a hot one it was a hotline that\nPeople didn't know what to think they were all shell shocked yeah\nAnd after dinner the three of us kind of gotten this argument and there was a little bit of wine involved but you know what struck me about the argument was we were\nNot talk about politics at the holiday table yes let's leave it there let's leave it there yeah did your family Thanksgiving inspire this at all it actually did a it was right the Thanksgiving right after the twenty sixteen election I was a hot one it was a hot one that people didn't know what to say they were all shell shock yeah\nAnd that for dinner the three of us kind of gotten this argument and there was a little bit of wine involved\nBut you know what struck me about the argument was that we were all on the same side we all voted for the same person rather enthusiastically Mm I think my brother his kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders guy and I think his position was you know we'll probably could have won this [noise] and\nYou know my mom lives in in South central Ohio and she was saying well they forgot about the mid west they gave up the mid west which is ridiculous and I was kind of like well it's Kobe's fault and this\nAnd it just struck me that if we're also aligned and ... and we're fighting what's going on to their tables around the country here and and so I I knew that that arena would be like a really fun area for us to explore and I knew it can be funny and potentially explosive yeah\nWhat I Love about the movie and you miss 'em that it it it it makes us all think about how and when and how much we should talk about politics\nI covered the last election and my ... him oh throughout was like people to talk about more yeah because it's the shapes the nation and we put the hard stuff to the side are only preached to the choir and talk more but now I'm usually like everyone just shut up I\nMean I was like you I was the guy for a good year and a half that\nSit down at dinner with some friends first and talk about can you

your blood pressure and I think you know when I wrote the movie I was like I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really has obsessive and he's consumed by the cycle\nSo I had to CNN Fox News MSNBC I'm twenty four really and I was writing it and it makes you crazy to do it is a a slightly romantic story\nBut I'm ... right after we first meet them um I really wanted to show the
