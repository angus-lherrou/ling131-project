they let me you know this is the ... well I don't know if it was a ... or something but there was one that had Idaho have a Ninety light as the favorite candidate [laughter]\nNice Maddie like\nAll right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy uh movies yes was difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up each other\nWe didn't we need to miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched the summer where a teenage girls private love letters were mysteriously males to all of her crushes I think it's really cool that you think I have golden spent my eyes\nTo letters around [noise] then there was this\nOther one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her strange father\nGot credibly drunk that night and I let them blacked out because [noise]\nI think it's really cool that you think I have golden spent my eyes\nThe letters around [noise] then there was this\nOther one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her strange father\nLeft that incredibly drunk that night and I blacked out because [noise]\nThat's what's on the ground and hunting though the fun thing about all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved before and like father have you ever watch any of those\nMovies that are three okay which took I watched um televise before of course so good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely I feel retro that that might feel I feel like you know it stokes a particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get some scribe has to watch romantic comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of a lot of very closely\nHer name is Gwen I'm Nat she writes for the onions Avi club she's been closely following the summer of love so we talked all about it\nGlenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me cigarettes and yet I haven't been ... out\nFor several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer and that you didn't even\nOf love so we talked all about hey Glenn how are you\nGood how are you doing I'm good I'm thank you for your time\nOh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited\nYet I have been kind of you out for several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer\nI Know you didn't even now [noise] um they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer\nA that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even number of views that's viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like\nFour or five times a piece you you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching these rom coms my big question and first question about all of this is like what\nLed Netflix no or think that rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take to rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix they will just might work for us\nThink they just spied on completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book critic offshoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want\nLike just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you kind of out of luck so for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are\nAnd and comic book club shoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want\nLike just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you kind of out of luck so for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used\nAnd it's worked out really well for them yeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters YV left rom coms\nWrit large I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars bat\nJammed with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when you grand and Julia Roberts you just basically put Graham with anybody like this one was on double up next why not but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon invincible on and for Christmases and the tank and these are superstars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms\nSeems like it's going to have to be a kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls re runs again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms genre and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars and see a lovely couple end up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going to\nUm should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because I mean crazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want you know a lovely\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Sierra Nevada Brewing

a little bit gold medalists alley Raisman she was speaking at the trial of Larry Nassar\nHe was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under his care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university ... Nassar was recently sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job and were less than a week ago today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater ... barrel she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager and\nSo he helps drive and I came in and I to and from practice which both of our families really appreciated and so and he would only pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to\nThe rank and it but you know sometimes we and other places but even if we did go to the rank and skate then there was molest station that happened before and after I mean in the parking lots of high school parking lot\nRight he was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state\nReally appreciated and so and he would only pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to\nThe rink and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rink and skate when there was molestation that happened before and after I mean in the rain parking lots for high school parking lot\nRighty was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year old Olympic medalist Andy Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I\nHome from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThen I mean I can picture clear as day back out of her driveway go down the street stops I take a right and you go to my house\nAnd it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end which in hindsight it's interesting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took off his seat belt and he turned to me and he said can I guess you\nWould have had a minimum I said nothing I just sat there and um\nI Will sit here and honestly say I did I say no to no ... and not run away but I was frozen yeah I mean people say their fight or flight but there's freaks and that's what happened and\nI remember after that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like a fog or a I mean now now we have an especially I was like W T F [laughter] yeah you know and run shock Robert Tonner present\nAnd only ... how would I tell you\nBut there's freaks and that's\nWhat happened and I remember after that\nWhen we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like\nLike a fog or a\nI mean now now we have an expression I was like W. E. T. F. [laughter] yeah you know and writes shocks probably ... percent\nAnd only ... how would I tell anyone who would believe me what proof to have why would anyone\nBelieves that he would do you know I mean just um\nAnd it wasn't violet in\nWhat we think of as traditional violence you know so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan and you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so [noise] yeah that I mean honest to God that is the day my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in the ... the the contact become more intense\nBut yeah so so people will say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question\nOn any I never had\nSex and the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was direct um [noise] and you're touching follow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taken advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time I'm very much so so uh [noise]\nHe ... he had um a growing issue skating and so he saw my father for his\nDoctor for that and ...\nThirty three while Andy is taking advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time I'm\nVery much so so ah [noise] he ... he had um a growing issue was skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that and my mom he came over to the house a couple of times and I took piano lessons from my mom\nOh my goodness yeah so have you in your house yeah broken Allison from your mother you knew what he was doing to you she did not know how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean I think it it was such a time of\nConfusion and I was so dedicated to wanting to skate that I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have\nAny anything to barter I didn't have\nMoney I didn't have 'em anything the only thing that he wanted for me was my ... slot body um and um it but it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violence with me and he took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming\nOn your blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something there not straight they're bent to go left and the offset and so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement Curtis\nBut he wasn't violence with me and he took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming\nAmir blades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something\nThere not straight they're bent to go left and the offset and so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement Curtis is pretty deep as a kid\nAnd so I'm as you're getting better that all of those metrics have to change and for the Nineteen Ninety eight Olympic trials surgical winter club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training programs sent to the Olympic trials\nSo our coach you also was volunteer had a full time job and a family\nUm he Andy took care of my blades and I mean our coach Andy and other top skaters are higher priority so he\nHelped me out and a lot of ways my mother said if you want to go to a skating find a ride to the rank and Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else it could be your\nUm because he was\nKind to me in and gave me things um you know bought me things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean\nSo things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second I I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I\nWas mowing lawns in the summer that's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had\nMe things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean some things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second I I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I\nWas mowing lawns in the summer that's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute [laughter] it's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids you're right but\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is it's gray two things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had homecoming dance and I wanted to go with actually my date lived down the street from Andy one block away so and\nUm he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm so long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go on after party I can go to anything I had to come directly home and\nSo I told the group of friends I was going with my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing and I go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured that it fine but it was because he was controlling yeah when I told my parents mom we pick me
