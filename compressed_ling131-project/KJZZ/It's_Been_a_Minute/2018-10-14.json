to myself do you mean to my folks do you mean to my friends do you mean I I it depends what you're talking okay well\nYou see what I'm saying today on the show we're going to explore the history of coming out and coming out day I was how it came to be how it's changed over time\nAnd what it means for the algae Beatty cue community to them back when Bob grew up in the sixties you could get locked up for even going to a gay bar it was a very different times so Bob's first coming out actually wasn't until Nineteen Seventy four after he just had his first same sex experience\nBob told his best

was coming out we didn't have a models in public discourse there were no models for gay people\nOn the generous hadn't come out of the television and uh the will and grace was far in the future and so um I think it's a different world than I I hear about people coming out at the age of twelve and I think could lord I was never that brave I mean never in the world\nAnd I don't really know what it would be like today to do that\nI don't know either I mean I remember my process and it literally Bob it took me years just to look at myself in the mirror and say the words I Am gay\nRonald Reagan didn't even say the word aids in public until September Nineteen eighty five that was a few years after the federal government first acknowledge that disease\nThere was a hard time to be gay and hard

Thirteen ... and I remember\nI don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch wow that makes sense ... and I and I probably thought later it's not just to see it but I

right\nExactly and it's not like I'm looking for perfection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody you know that I I click with\nAnd obviously you didn't click with Richard has there

just I just want to be happy and you think you can't have these things with a woman well\nAs I had a pretty big problem with it you know there are a lot of people out there I think people like me are sick\nYou so I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades and one of the backlash that she face was pretty ethic lost his show all these conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show he ABC actually\nPut an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman [noise]\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine airing um snow in April in Nineteen Ninety seven\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the good characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that but not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids\nOr you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue or the only right thing to do was embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible biggest\nWow [noise] it's so funny she says\nBut not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids\nOr you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there's no right and wrong in this issue of the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible ... wow\nWow [noise] it's so funny she says there's an agenda to normalize homosexuality it's\nLike yeah yeah yeah there is a partner [laughter] the whole ... kids it's okay you can try to uh it was fascinating to hear it 'cause that's of course what they were terrified about that it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um [noise]\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly and can I jump and I know we're going decade by decade I'll do it go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it\nI'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh\nIs when it appeared and um and he sets off a brain blow flag waving firestorm really of protest when he says don't come out you say ... like clear people stopped coming out\nAnd do we get back on from Nineteen Ninety seven Allen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm don't do a academic saying don't\nDo it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay so for one and this is debatable\nAmerica this is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still\nAre no we don't do it academic saying don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay so for one and this is debatable\nAmerica this is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nI'm paraphrasing he's you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it but they don't wear as head of sexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out for no one should\nMaybe heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people\nAnd that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now you know we think of the army singer Frank Ocean she she came out but he never use the word gay right you know you think about Jodie Foster Amos Lee kind of came out\n[laughter] Globes we actually have paper that\nYou know I'm just going to put it out there right loud and proud right so I'm I'm In each of support on [noise]\nYes\nI think\nI already did like on the outer thousand years ago back

like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be coming out yeah and\nSee this is where we go back to it being both a personal any political choice\nAnd I think the personal has to come first and I think that you know you and I know the the list of celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know I'm Out\nAnd you really want to come out and who flirt with it much like for us to did [noise] um and then for whatever reasons whether it's the ...\nUm whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know they decide not to or they don't yet or they wait or whatever and

G.\nYou're listening to it's been a minute from NPR's Sam Sanders this past Thursday October eleventh was thirty national coming out day mark that day we are exploring coming out [noise] and I was never just one day\nAnd how it's different for different people born in in this next segment you'll hear a gay slur I've been talking with e Patrick Johnson you the head of the African American studies department at Northwestern university and he told me how coming out can change when you're from a marginalized background\nI'm Talking about black people brown people and there's people whoever\nWhere you live a gay life\nBut you don't talk about it and maybe there isn't a coming out day where you tell everyone [laughter] folks know and and and like other folks don't [laughter] this feels to me\nTo be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white and my rights and yes yes and yeah and if you are already\nHailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of your rights or a black person I like the next person an Asian person and that brings with it a whole set of responses to who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have\nThe white and my rights and yes yes and yeah and if you are already hailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of your right to a a a black person I like the next person Asian person\nAnd that brings with it a whole set of responses to who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have\nAny choice but to\nLive with that because you you can hide it and I especially feel that way I'm for African Americans in particular because of the\nConnection to the church mhm you couldn't go to any black church in the United states and not find\nA game in a ... a whole ... of them yes\nUm and it's a complicated place because I grew up in the church and the church is actually where I feel I came into my own\nWork I mean like I felt safe there like as a young black boy in the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of correct but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit mhm it was just weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there yeah I mean\nThe churches where I was encouraged to um express myself which you know I was a big old clean 'em and and the choirs than a singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos section\nAnd I'm sure they ended up I'm sure they loved it there will be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age because you sent yet ... not in my church that I thought okay that [laughter]\nBut many charges were doing ... made a absolute and still do and ... and so yeah it it's a really um\nA singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos section and I'm sure they ended up I'm sure they loved it there will be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age because you've sent yet ... not in my church that I thought okay that [laughter]\nBut many charges were doing ... made a absolute and still do and ... and so yeah it it's a really a\nConcert [laughter] right yeah no but that that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low phenomena and also we should stop to define what the down low is for those who might not know\nYes so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not attend a fight as gay\nAnd they're usually black and only ... for men other than black man\nYes I'm even though that's not true\n[laughter] well I mean like ... for like white man they as they were living in a life you know the lead a double life yeah why does it say about what coming out has become where you move from Harvey\nMilk in the seventies to coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time the subset of the community black man they're still being labeled with this term deal\nSo at the same time that yes there was a part of the community that we're not being open there was another part that was actually being\nVery open in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of a black in Latin next lesbians\nWere open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing are pushing back against the second wave feminist movement was white ...\nVery open in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of of black in Latin next lesbians were open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing\nOf pushing back against the second wave feminism movement\nWas white straight middle class women and and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lord a Sheree Morocco Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these black lesbians yeah and like lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history has not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat choice can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on any riots there another listener who share to coming out story with us on a as twenty five from Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago on he came out to family and friends as clear\nTheir parents reacted okay not great but okay but I didn't have the second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nI was in college and I in one of my classes on my professor at brought in a in a trench shoot a gentleman who is just like kind of sharing her story that guy is like to be only strong and like you know soft and\nUm and I always felt like something was wrong but like compensated by eating like in the military\nI was in college and I in one of my classes um my professor had brought in a kind of trans she was a gentleman who is just like kind of sharing her story just a guy I was like raised to be only strong and like no softness and\nUm and I've always felt like something was wrong but like compensated by being like in the military and that kind of life and had kids and like all this stuff and um and I never gave myself face to really like\nAsk myself centrally like think\nAbout who I Am\nI was like have you back in my chair and as I always did it in class and I'm just kinda mulling over another like giving yourself the space to ask yourself [noise] never done that before\nInteresting and so they pose myself that question I was like okay well I Am I on it and like almost fell out of my chair [laughter] because I was like the answer was no ...\n\nOn a recently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy on his parents got really hung up on that\nThey kinda got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an aesthetic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't like things about my body and everybody just like things about their body but we still owe like\nMake our way through life and we just have to learn to love ourselves and it was like well there's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean dissociative with your with like a body part and like\nI don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I kind of\nMade it clear that like it doesn't matter if you understand or not but like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor\nLength of ourselves and it was like well there's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean just says it with your with like a body art and like I don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I\nKind of made it clear that like it doesn't matter if you understand it and I felt like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor my autonomy on that and that was something that\nYeah the other it in a\nWay like Saturday Night and then as the going off to that and my dad called out after me and sound like again tonight and thanks for being yourself\n\nI mean maybe not never really under stand and that but I'm Still their cat and um yeah and we still on each other\nThat was on the rise in Minnesota their story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Alan did Twenty one years ago professor e Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to\nLike Janelle Monday a is an example because she didn't come out
