pack I remember my early days I used to have an argument with my ex husband every time I had\nAn audition how's that for whatever reason just a random argument you for everything our way of happened before I was going on an audition and we had an argument\nAnd I never forgive driving over the hill to go to Warner Brothers mall in my eyes out and I knew I had to go in there and be funny I was going in for a role I remember like it was yesterday\nRyan Murphy had a TV show called popular\nAnd I was going in there to play a lobster [laughter] and I\nI'd all the way they [noise] why when I pulled up\nI why my face\nYeah I got it together yeah I took a deep breath yes\nAnd I went in that room now here's the other thing that happened I was used to auditioning\nAnd seeing girls that I didn't know I was comfortable where I was yeah but if you're going to go to the next level he's got to stretch you yeah I go and buy he I mean the big key okay okay yeah uh the big age eight so I go into the audition room and I look and I recognize every girl in there really it was to Sheena Campbell T shirt Arnold and\nOr all the girls from all the Ninety six and I was like oh my God I turn

I went back in there and I am very happy to report that Ryan Murphy cast me as little bay\nOkay I'll play the lobster popular thank you very\nMuch or even in front of all these girls who had worked way more yeah and I had at that day\nSo you mentioned these auditions going in there with that confidence and having to go back in there with a confidence one thing you didn't say is a early on when you were auditioning for stuff you were taken three children to the audition skip that part talked about that and better or yeah\nWhat what what can I Do like I could have been at home and just been like I don't have anybody to care for the ... little like six or seven maybe one was another almost three years under that and another one three years under that little little babies and little by

today\n[noise] where it was a new smashed she stars on the TV drama claw I'm Sam Sanders and you're listening to a special edition of the spin a minute for NPR\nSince my favorite conversations from the last year of our show stay tuned much at with Jimmy oh yang known from HBO Silicon Valley and the movie crazy Rich Asians\nBut before that let me just say that each week you're on the show we work really hard to bring you new voices talking in ways you haven't heard before you want to support the work we do bring any of those voices and conversations are only here on this public radio station give now yourself\nIts like health Black Panther yeah see my met that on Twitter people got mad at me they got like this is going to be a Black Panther obviously jokingly because yeah the movies I'm not gonna like you know yeah yeah\nBut for me it's like I Hope basically with that statement I'm saying I Hope it's gonna be box office assess yeah and the cultural presentation Panthers\nAnd apply for it to me there ... they they tell me shut the effort and they tell them I like\nUh why is it like whenever by people got a little bit of shine you all got to try to take it for yourself I don't know what are you talking about Twitter is bad yeah and an Asian people like you know that this will be it could stand on its own like we don't have to compare like and diminished both of the movie I'm like oh what does it feel\nTo make a movie like this that is in many ways a groundbreaking but it's also entering this cultural moment right now where it seems every one is always mad about everything before it's even there\nAnd you you know who's critic in the hardest or the ... the idea for my acting career Asian people huh you play and an immigrant on Silicon Valley that makes me look bad blah blah blah all this like you play the accent of character but I Try to play everything very often\nIt is that is in many ways of groundbreaking but it's also entering this cultural moment right now where it seems every one is always mad about everything before it's even there\nAnd you know who's critic in the hardest or the critique the I get from I I think we're\nAsian people huh you play and an immigrant on Silicon Valley that makes me look bad blah blah blah all this like you play this accent a character but I Try to play everything very authentic even if it is an accent an immigrant or ... that I plan Silicon Valley\nI tried to play it just a version of myself when I came to this country I was Thirteen and I'm trying to represent my immigrants you know\nSo you wrote in the book something you're basically said like the issue is not the role the issue is the baggage people feel about these accents and sell it for ... why do you feel so bad about the accent\nAnd Sophia regard as sexy whatever accent why am I thirty and everyone like British accent yeah why is that when a white actor or even a black actor does a\n... a British accent it's considered art it's considered oh he did well nobody ever gave chat with Bozeman anything like you're doing an African accent you've never rent misrepresent African people but you know you know what it is what is and this movie's hopefully going to fix part of that uh-huh it's there's not enough of us out there\nOkay so everything is being scrutinized when you one out of five Asian people on TV\nAll the pressures on you and you have to represent with all the ... spectrum who I can name I don't know okay let's go there are a lot of the few John Cho is always on TV she is always weren't yeah my boy can John has always movies TV yeah something really easy to Larry ... like comic as a comedian I think funny part on it\nLike you know who else was like OK well who else who else are Constance Wu Randall part I mean the whole show you know it was like yeah yeah so there are getting more and more now okay but it's still it's like the problem with our food that documentary yeah it's it's just about that since he was the most important if you're the\nOh is that movies TV yeah she's something really easy to elaborate a bit like comic as a community and I think funny part on it\nLike you know who else was like OK well who else who has a cost us will Randall part I mean the whole show you know like yeah yeah so there are getting more and more now okay\nBut it's still it's like the problem with our food that documentary yeah it was just about us him he was the most important if you're the one you carry all the way it exactly so the problem it's it's not enough representation\nAnd hopefully what crazy Rich Asians you get a whole spectrum of Asian and I felt so good to not move because I could I could just be funny and act to fool yeah because I'm not represent all ages I'm just represents one personality\n[noise]\nI was Jimmy oh yang median after you know Mayfield Silicon Valley is also in the hit movie crazy Rich Asians and the vet Jimmy returns to talk about how she learned English from
