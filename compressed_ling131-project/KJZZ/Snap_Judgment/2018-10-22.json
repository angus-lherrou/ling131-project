follow her father and the problem was no one would tell her why oh\nMy sister pretty much that me down on my bed 'cause I was asking her questions she was saying that he was sick and that and this is what he had he had paranoid schizophrenia and I said oh you know what does that mean and she said it was a mental illness\nReaders dad lived the life of a shut it he kept the blinds closed all day

much sitting around his apartment in his underwear eating cereal\nYeah he used the way these white boxer shorts and a white T shirt White Sox everything was right white except for his lip is that they will block he wasn't very very talkative I'm you know and and he would always speak very softly\nBut he did have business associates you wouldn't go to any officer telephone into meetings but these guys would come to him and his dark apartment\nAnd he never spoke on the phone that was the other thing I realized I never spoke on the phone as a matter of fact most of the time the phone was off the hook the other piece that um was strange to me was that one of these men used\nTo come you know his his his people that were in this business with him uh when they used to come and sit around my grandmother's a dining room table the\nRail would be on TV it would be on a nobody would be really speaking there would be more of a whisper\nAnd then people would be you know writing notes back and forth to my dad\nAnd he would ask somebody right [noise]\nThere were a lot of things that didn't add up for re that when she was a kid\nLike if the family did go out to eat and never had to wait in line at the neighborhood restaurant and they would get taken in the back door\nThere were some kids that weren't allowed to come to her house to play and she didn't know why it was\nThe feeling of not knowing truth you know like I knew knew something was not write something wasn't the truth\nIn high school that she was spreading a rumor about my family about my dad\nAnd about me calling me and my fear princes this went on for a while before I had my full of her [noise]\nAnd there were only a few times in my life where I raised my hands\nTruth you know like I knew knew something was not write something wasn't the truth\nThere was a girl in high school that she was spreading a rumor about my family about my dad\nAnd about me calling me and my fear princes this went on for a while before I had my full of her\nAnd there were only a few times in my life where I raised my hand\nI just said you know who the F do you think you are right in my hand around the back of her\nAnd I just took her head and I hit her head against the sink in the bathroom\nWhich created all the blood to come out of our nose in ...\nAnd she fell on the floor and I just I had her again\nAnd I says don't you ever\nCome here and talk about me or my family ever again and I walked out\nThere was so many things that ran through me and then all of a sudden the adrenaline kicked in like oh my God could this be true there\nWas something inside of me that day that had to know at that point you know what what what this was what was going on what all\nThe secrets the lies the the you know the whispering the\nEverything that was happening my whole life up until that time I was sixteen at that time\nI got home I took my bicycle and I went to a good friend of the family and I like them to help me if I had blood on my hands from the girl when I had a I was hysterical and she said to me sit down\nYou know who your father is right and I said you know what I Want you to tell me exactly who he is and what's what's happening\n\nSaid your father is the boss of the Genovese crime family and I took a deep breath and she said and that's\nAnd I had a I was hysterical and she said to me sit down\nYou know who your father is right and I said you know what I Want you to tell me exactly who he is and what's what's happening\n\nShe said your father is the boss of the Genovese crime family\nAnd I took a deep breath and she said and that's not it she says he's also the head of the five families [noise] the little Casey the Genovese the banana\nThe Colombo and John Gotti was from Gambia\nNobody could make a move without asking my dad to mission for anything meaning [noise] say they wanted to do let's just give an example of they wanted to put her head on somebody and nobody can do that unless they asked my dad to mission [noise] I at some point my ears shut down\nBecause I couldn't hear another word that she was saying because at that moment all the pieces of the puzzle from my past that I didn't understand all of those pieces of the puzzle snapped into place for me\nI was really baffled that my dad being\nPowerful because one I saw him he was in a rope a pair of slippers and you know this was this is my experience of him I didn't see him wielding all this power\nI said to her well what's this whole thing about you know my dad having paranoid schizophrenia she goes no that's just a ruse\nSo that the government thinks that he's second that he couldn't possibly be running that family running the Genovese crime family and I said oh OK\nGuy go home I'm not I'm I'm really ... you know my mother know something's wrong and I just said I'm going\nParanoid schizophrenia she goes no that's just a ruse\nSo that the government thinks that he's second that he couldn't possibly be running that family running the Genovese crime family and I said oh OK\nGuy go home I'm not I'm I'm really ... you know my mother know something's wrong and I just said I'm going to my room and I I don't even know how many hours I slept just from being um depleted from the whole day\nAnd then she realized that I Know and you know she sat me down but\nIt was more of a sit me down and just reiterate you can't tell anybody anything if anybody asks your father sick there was no kind of explanation clause mom didn't really have an explanation because mom only knew so much\nHer dad was Vincent gone to any\nMen in New York Times said ruled Genevieve crime family with impenetrable secrecy the [noise] the Genovese soldiers and associates forbidden under his name and where his nickname conversations or even in phone calls it's kind of\nUnknown thing in that dynamic uh you you don't talk about uh the business or anything having to do with the business this is not something we sat at the dinner table and talked about Mm I don't think anybody thinks of their father is\nCommitting a crime or\nActually telling somebody to commit a crime so yeah I was definitely having an issue with was struggling with\nThe fact that he could do that\nAnd yet be this loving father at the same time\n\nOnce I knew about it and kinda digested as a bit ah\nCommitting a crime or\nActually telling somebody to commit a crime so yeah I was definitely having an issue with was struggling with the fact that he could do that\nAnd yet be this loving father at the same time\nUm\nOnce I knew about it and kinda digested of the bed I kind of became part of the role playing and so I became one of the actors in this in this grand scheme my dad would say to me come on let's walk\nI'd say OK Topher there put the put the ...\nThe rope was on and underneath that he had his pajamas in any one of the flippers and he says come I walked me and so I Would be like oh my God like devastated\nThat I had to go out into the world you know what this so I Would be holding his arm he'd whisper to me you know hold me up like make like a hold of me up kind of thing and and he walked to shovel he would stop\nAnd he would mumble under his breath I'd have my head down roll him I was like oh God please\nCan we get this over with kind of\nThing but there was also the protection that he was my father and
