allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this logging get across the river\nAnd ... came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand them pull him up in the rock and he was terrified and was rocking logging\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nAnd I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for\nA minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and that pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie and he's patting me on the back and asking me if\nA soldier they looked at him

at him and the kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the switch shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and up to try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they praying they mind their own business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for\nLife and they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim

themselves ultimately to exposed a repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living with skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself were pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take\nMatters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we had seen them murders somebody I very much\nSaw them as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talked in the is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your time\nSo that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but you would strategize about how we would pick up rocks back in the schools are stabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and to fight his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain and one of the characters are ... split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers when they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was\nAnd you start imagining and exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out that have been five minutes and I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering\nTo count again and then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out that have been five minutes and I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on ... we were starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nAnd do one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nOf set as weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously a myth that he is following the story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him to not [noise]\nServed pleading with him not to go\nGet dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to not go he he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off the face\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him to not [noise]\nServed pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to not go he he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up do tracking down which to Base Camp will Jason and his crew lets see up the mountain now it was for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere was just as ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy has got to guns and the anger named the knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of three and especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain\nTogether and I'm always trying to find a\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way but also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell they were there were like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at\nLooks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nWhen you could tell they were there were like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they would it I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still need and will be\nMorally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and when racing up to class and it just sort of scrambled\nUp over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab his gun strap a sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strap and I pulled as hard as I could and he just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of wanting to spark through them and like any turn and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact and the whole way down\nThe second operation mend me stiff carrying the SCUD missiles [noise] um [noise] not stiffness manifests in my personality [noise] um I always\nKnew that he had medical issues and then obviously it has to brand surgeries and I was really traumatic for me I because [noise] fourteen\nAt the time this teen some like that this is due to brother Spencer and while stewardess stiff or brittle Spencer is known by everyone and his family to me all hearts and free spirit he loves being outdoors listened to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on pedaling on my head down to really like ... cranes revolving salt like one two one two something like that you gotta you know you had that sense of joy and you're just like wind down it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy until one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with it now formation in his brain [noise]\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have\nUm like that you gotta you know you had a source of joy and you're just like wind down it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with an el formation in his brain [noise]\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with grand mal formations\nBecause he was crazy Spencer ... formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but ... didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would result\nAnd this was about the time when ... became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the NATO rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone\nOr you know I'm without his input I felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to Ken how strongly did you feel this way I Would say that I say about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nUh just knock that coming out of the surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was real scared of\nA different person since I was scared his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes people\nExperience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous\nNot that coming out of surgery as a totally

that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all men are familiar made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure\nEven if they help yeah\nThere was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regrets about my own surgeries because I still\nHave symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime\nMinute to him that [noise] one of my\nBiggest regrets
