you lose [laughter] so ... is upset because prop one twenty seven is saying that he's corrupt and when I first read about this I thought boy if every candidate or elected officials sued over being called corrupt that would be all the courts would ever be able to do\nAnd that's the problem is that when you're talking about a campaign advertising and elected officials I mean if you\nSuit may sue you blue [laughter] so ... is upset because prop one twenty seven is saying that he's corrupt and when I first read about this I thought boy if every candidate or elected officials sued over being called corrupt that would be all the courts would ever be able to do\nAnd that's the problem is that when you're talking about a campaign advertising and elected officials I mean if you had to return on commercial TV you know I I feel the need to take a bath afterwards given marshals out there\nYou've got some interesting questions of at what point do you cross the lie part of the argument being made by Dennis will and checks who's burner but just private attorney in this case is that there are some factual errors\nFor example he said there's a statement in there that a PS gay four hundred thousand dollars to help elect burn a bridge four years ago\nI'm Wondering from your perspective given the amount of time you spent with her and with other employees there and researching what had happened\nNow that she is at least for now been reassigned and not a Grand Canyon where does that leave some of those efforts do you think\n[noise] I'm not sure I I expect that those efforts will continue and I haven't confirmed this through my own reporting I Am working on following up on this for outside magazine so\nI Hope to to get some more from answers but there are definitely programs to put in place about helping people cope with trauma in the park employees and and an ombudsman and and I think that those programs will stay in place I mean there's\nThere's certainly nothing wrong with with supporting employees who have experienced trauma and providing resources for them so\nI Know that Chris brought\nIn a deputy superintendent you know to help carry out these policies and she along with the other deputy superintendent you know are the ones that are in charge now\nWhile Chris's is reassigned and so I think that those programs to help prevent harassment and support employees who have experienced it will continue\nSense of how morale is that's a park right now I mean as you wrote about and even though not everybody was necessarily in love with her management style there would seem to be sort of a sense of greed\nAre the ones that are in charge now while Chris's is reassigned and so I think that those programs to help prevent harassment and support employees who have experienced it will continue\nAny sense of how morale is that the park right now I mean as you wrote about and even though not everybody was necessarily in love with her management style there was seemed to be sort of a sense of great optimism that she was going to come in and really do some good things and now seemingly just a short time later she's gone I mean I Can't imagine it right from around there\nNo I feel like all the people that I've talked to me you know whether they you know even the people that were critical of Christ in terms of her management style with the river everyone is just like this is such a crazy place like\nIt's just they were hoping that the part could get beyond kind of just going from one crisis to the next and has some stability and so I definitely have friends you know they're just kind of saying this is you know just more of the same in terms of Grand Canyon having management crises\nUm year after year and even though no one has any idea what this is about a it is hard for morale to just have kind of a sense of instability\nAll right that's Jeanette may give new she's a freelance journalist based in Flagstaff she's written extensively about

package address to former CIA director John Brennan\nNone of the bombs have reached their targets and no injuries have been reported but one thing all the recipients have in common is that they've been frequent target of president Donald Trump\nI think President Obama has been the most ignorant president in our history you can have the biggest story about Hillary Clinton I mean look at what

gets away with [noise]\nSeriously low IQ Russia feel I have no confidence and a guy like brother and I think is a total loss of life\nOn Wednesday afternoon at the White House President Trump struck a different tone\nI just wanted to use that in these times we have to unify\nWe have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message and that actually more threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nBut by the evening at a rally in Wisconsin the president returned to his more familiar talking points\nThe media also has a responsibility to shut a civil tone to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes falls attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nI by the way you see how nice ... this is like\nWorld will be a very very well [noise]\nI Know we we can keep it that way right [noise]\nFrankly it feels like a lot of Americans are not on their best behavior that political rancor is having a direct impact on our democracy according to the Pew Research center there's a growing partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans on a range of important issues and partisan animosity has more than doubled since Nineteen Ninety four\nTo better understand this connection between politics tribalism and violence we turn now to Jonathan height a social psychologist at the New York university stern school of business and author of the righteous mind why good people are divided by politics and religion\nIt's a growing part is in gap between Democrats and Republicans on a range of important issues and partisan animosity has more than doubled since Nineteen Ninety four\nTo better understand this connection between politics tribalism and violence we turn now to Jonathan height a social psychologist at the New York university stern school of business and author of the righteous mind why good people are divided by politics and religion the\nFirst thing to note is that there is a huge long downward trend in violence of all sorts and this should be the background to any discussion here in writing my recent books I've been looking back then I can sixties and the amount of violence\nNineteen sixty eight is stunning and horrific compared to now so things are really bad in terms of our cross partisan hatred um but actually so far only a few people have died and and that's something we need to keep in mind things are better now than they were in the sixties\nAnd when we talk about um comparing now to the sixties I'm thinking about for example Heather hire who died um in Charlottesville as a result of you know being at one of these rallies and thinking about just the fear of the potential for for death but you're saying like in terms of the actual numbers were doing better now than we were a couple of decades ago\nThat's right so in terms of the things holding our democracy together they are much weaker now our our democracy I think is in more danger now than it was in the Nineteen sixties\nBut as passions ramp up the restraints on violence the general social consensus that violence is is unacceptable\nIs so much stronger I mean the number of bombings the beatings the number of people who died in the sixties and so yes Heather higher is is the stunning horror of last year and there'd been a number of beatings and punching from both sides\nBut not that many people actually died now that could change\nThe rate is certainly very heavily armed of anti on the left does go round beating people so that ... could go up so far we're not there yet\nSo much stronger I mean the number of bombings that beatings the number of people who died in the sixties and so yes Heather higher is is the stunning horror of last year and there've been a number of beatings and punching from both sides but not that many people actually died now that could change\nThe right is certainly very heavily armed of antifa on the left does go round beating people so the jets could go up so far we're not there yet\nYou've written a lot about this idea of tribalism hum what are some American tribes\n[noise] there's a wonderful report that just came out that I think every American should read or read a summary of\nIt's called the hidden tribes report is done by a group based in the u._k. but they're studying this kind of polarization and the rise of populism all over let's let's bear in mind that this American problem is not unique to America we aren't that many European countries are are seeing some similar problems as well\nAnd I think the ... the way to think about this is that America used to have a we used to have many different cross cutting identities and even our two parties the Republicans in the Democrats each had a liberal and conservative wing to them\nAnd one of the big changes that's very risky for our democracy is that from the beginning of the Nineteen eighties through the Nineteen nineties especially\n... cents Alexandra ... in New York these candidates who are pretty high profile on a national stage right now talking about Medicare for all what do you think it's behind that right now\nWell I think there's great frustration uh with uh the healthcare system I think that more and more insured Americans realize that their coverage is not adequate and also I have this belief that we've tried everything else so\nWhy not try was popular and works and Medicare shows that role it is a sign of the times and I honestly believe that the attack on the Affordable CARE Act\nBy the Trump Administration and the response to it has raised the issue up again and put the fundamental questions on the table and that is how are we going to guarantee health care with no barriers to care and I think it's a reflection of senator Sanders' campaign where he made it a key issue in twenty sixteen\nAnd then uh the fight over the ca and really the activists and the commitment particularly among the disabled community to say Medicaid which is a a public program that was not necessarily well known or well liked but now has a much higher profiling people realize how essential to do this\nNo barriers to care and I think it's a reflection of senator Sanders' campaign where he made it a key issue in twenty sixteen\nAnd then uh the fight over the ca and really the activists and the commitment particularly among the disabled community to say Medicaid which is a a public program that was not necessarily well no wonder well liked but now has a much higher profiling people realize how essential that is so how\nDoes this sort of playing with the conversation around the Affordable CARE Act or Obamacare right like that and and now what ended up happening with the Affordable CARE Act right\nThat's right the Affordable CARE Act is essentially\nAn extension of the existing system which subsidizes through taxes the purchase of private health insurance\nIt does many many good things in that regard this Medicare for all is really a way to build on that foundation of expansion but does so directly reading subsidizing coverage directly pay providers instead and it's a much more efficient system\nI Do believe that the debate and particularly the the response to the attacks on the CIA has raised the public's commitment to universal healthcare and really now it's just a question of how how to do it\nDo you mean now that that that the mandate you had health care anything is a thing that exists in our in our sort of national consciousness this has changed the conversation\nI think it has and I and I think that um they're really that was the one of the great values of that debate um ah both during the Obama administration and and frankly in the beginning of the Trump and his racial when they attacked it I think people rightly are concerned that they're not going to get the health care they need and that has a reignited the interest in the solution that works\nDo do you worry that that at this point as the issues sort of seems to have suddenly become very popular and and and maybe because of Bernie Sanders' campaign like he sat or maybe the kinds of some of these other candidate\nUh both during the Obama administration end and frankly in the beginning of the chocolate is racial when they attacked it I think people rightly are concerned that they're not going to get the health care they need and that has a reignited the interest in a solution that works\nDean do you worry that that at this point as the issues sort of seems to have suddenly become very popular and and and maybe because of Bernie Sanders' campaign like he sat or maybe the kinds of some of these other candidates and talking about it now that do you worry that this is becoming campaign talking not necessarily anything that will turn into real action in Washington\nWill learn what I'm really worried about is people who say they support it they don't actually implemented or fight for it I'm more worried about that frankly and you're right in in any kind of campaign it can become a slogan\nAnd that is a great concern I think what we're we're seeing now for the first time is this broad support and really the the issue is to translate that into making that happen\nThat you have said that this is not a Republican versus Democrat thing that this is like a corporate America versus the rest of us kind of [laughter] and where do you see support for this on the Republican side though\nIt's concentrated among Republicans who earn less than thirty thousand dollars a year these are working class Republicans who are struggling just like every worker in this country to afford healthcare\nAnd we noticed specifically because when we looked at the exit polls from twenty sixteen fifty\nTwo percent of Trump voters who made under thirty thousand dollars a year\nSupport Medicare for all so that I think really is where it's coming from I think it's also coming from Republican women who tend to be more favorable toward Medicare for all I think it's also a women's issue because we know that women are regardless of party\nSupport universal healthcare are at higher rates and we also know that in general unless you're wealthy or it's difficult to afford health care in this country so it is a class issue\nAll so that I think really is where it's coming from I think it's also coming from Republican women who tend to have be more favorable toward Medicare for all I think it's also a women's issue because we know the women are regardless of party\nSupport universal healthcare are at higher rates and we also know that in general unless you will see a it's difficult to afford health care in this country so it is a class issue in that way and it's a gender issue and I think that's reflected in the Republican support majority support among Republicans in in the latest Reuters poll\nBut but on the other side of that President Trump recently just wrote an op ed and attacking this idea right saying that the program would cost thirty two point six trillion dollars in its first ten years are you saying that basically the mainstream\nPoliticians on both sides of the aisle are going to be against this idea that working class Americans would not be\nI think that's possible I think that a President Trump does not reflect a huge segment of his base when he attacks Medicare for all I think he is trying to use ... she does scare seniors and I don't think that's\nEither accurate or well advised and also the study that decided to thirty to a trillion dollar number that same study said that if we tried to cover everybody under the existing system it would cost more costs thirty four trillion\nSo I think it's odd decided to study that actually undermines your point\nLast thing I have where you might also when you talk about Medicare for all of that single payer universal healthcare these are all depending like buzz words right now but in reality this would be a really fundamental change in the way that we approach health care in this country do you think that\nThis is something that Americans are ready to wrap their heads around especially considering many of the attacks from the right would be talking about social and\nI Do think Americans are ready to do this because I think they're fed up with the health care debate I think they're fed up with a rising costs I think they're fed up\nYou're right now but in reality this would be a really fundamental change in the way that we approach health care in this country do you think that this is something that Americans are ready to wrap their heads around especially considering many of the attacks from the right would be talking about social and\nI Do think Americans are ready to do this because they are fed up with the health care debate I think they're fed up with a rising costs I think they're fed up with not being able to go to the doctor of their choice and so the politics of this are very favorable if you think about Medicare as it exists now it has the patient population that is\nOlder and therefore uh in higher need of care and generally more expensive if you include younger healthier people that's bound to strengthen that program so I Do believe that time has come for this\nAnd that the moniker of socialism just isn't well applied to Medicare I don't believe anyone thinks Medicare socialism Medicare works it has saved lives of\nMillions of lives of seniors and so this is a uniquely American solution ultimately we're talking about an American program that successful that has saved American lives that guarantees healthier\nOlder Americans and that's a model we should and can emulate for everybody\nAll right Michael ... thank you so much for the time

certain states will do to their state Supreme courts Arizona did that at one point very recently is that are possibilities are possibly of not making a lifetime term anymore\nIt's certainly a possibility and as you well know there have been proposals that have fixed the racial terms there's been proposals to add justices that the court whether it be that we have a total of eleven or twenty seven there's this other very interesting proposal of\nNot having the justice take a seat on the court until the president nominated that justice actually is gone right then age limits there's all kinds of proposed the real problem is that unless you have a body politic\nAnd that of course would include the president and the senators unless you have those individuals who actually care about having a great court\nYou know great judges are like Oliver Wendell or you know John Marshall William looked up then jamon Cardozo Felix Frankfurt her Louis Brandeis who by the way would never make it to the Supreme Court today because they were actually\nOn the ... [laughter] or Arizona's own Sandra\nDay O'Connor look what a fine judge with anybody really eager to have her lead the court no because people could trust her she didn't simply vote like a partisan hack\nSo are there any ideas to you that whether they have any sort of possibility that would potentially makes sense\nI haven't heard this proposal but it would take an amendment and that would be to require not just sixty votes but perhaps to their votes of the Senate and I'll tell you why I think something like that would certainly help\nI think one of the finest or individuals to be nominated in recent history was merit\nSort of possibility that would potentially makes sense\nI haven't heard this proposal but it would take an amendment and that would be to require not just sixty votes but perhaps to third votes of the Senate and I'll tell you why I say something like that would certainly help\nI think one of the finest or individuals to be nominated in recent history was Merrick Garland now why do I say that because Obama knew that he had to nominate somebody that would be palatable not only to the Democrats\nBut to the Republicans and so he he nominated somebody who is right smack dab\nIn the ideological center of his court the DC circuit\nOr the most recent nominee cab cabinet was that the extreme right but Merrick Garland was right in the center now why did Obama do that we know from his other nominees now he would prefer to put their ideological liberal\nJustices on the court but he knew he had an uphill fight that attracts such an appeal fighting that really got to hear it for his nominees but\nSo he knew that he had to nominate somebody who the Republicans would also Meyer and that was Merrick Garland so I think if we require some real bipartisanship\nOn the part of the Senate\nIn ... to get advice and consent\nAnd the president trying to please the other party as well as its own then we might start getting justice is who weren't these blind ET alive\nAnd I'm very sorry about it but that that's by and large what we have on the court now which is why on\nAll these hot button issues you got that Republicans on one side the up and Democrats on the other\nAnd we used to have you know Justice Kennedy you know in the middle sometimes one way or the other way the same thing with Sandra Day O'Connor\nThen we might start getting justice is weren't these blind eating a lot\nAnd I'm very sorry about it but that that's by and large what we have on the court now which is why on all these hot button issues you got that Republicans on one side the at the Democrats on the other end we used to have\nYou know Justice Kennedy you know in the middle of one way or the other way the same thing with Sandra Day O'Connor sometimes one way or the other way but the rest of them they're not acting like judge it they're acting like a politician's\nObviously no president is going to give up this power but what if we did have a commission of learned people from all over the spectrum\nYou know and it can be an uneven number and they get together I insider nominees dry and it's actually not just like the American bar association endorsing or not it's really discrimination would have actually asked some semblance of power and this is not the sort of thing that that could work potentially\nWell it could work and in fact there are states like Arizona and like New York\nMost of whom I leave much of the time on the ... those courts have been better than the United States Supreme court and it's because there has been gone artists in our

mid term elections and the ease of casting a ballot varies depending on where you live and the type of ballot you cast on election day whether digital or paper with such a fragmented system how can we keep our voting process secure and fair\nThere are more than ten thousand election jurisdictions in this country that's right I said ten thousand within those jurisdictions are hundreds of thousands of polling places and in a presidential election year you'll need about a million poll workers to make sure things run smoothly\nThat's a huge amount of infrastructure to protect from the kinds of threats we learned about after the twenty sixteen election like the potential for foreign interference in hacking\nAnd other gaps in the system like outdated machines and unequal access to polling places David Becker is here to discuss this splintered system of ours and he's the director and founder of the center for election innovation research David great to have you on the show as we're having\nSo a lot of what we're thinking about here and a lot of what we heard from our listeners is that we really don't all vote in the same way why do we have so many different types of voting in the United states\nThat's right there's a actually about ten thousand little elections are held on to ... rather than one big one\nOf the center for election innovation and research David great to have you on the show thanks for having me so a lot of what we're thinking about here and a lot of what we heard from our listeners is that we really don't all vote in the same way why do we have so many different types of voting in the United states\nWell that's right there's a actually about ten thousand little elections are held on each election day rather than one big one and that really dates back to the founding the republic where\nAh in the constitution and in our traditions is a typical that these states have control over elections and within the states the state's often delegate that responsibility down to the county or sometimes even the municipal level\nSo we talked about this thing that I Know people go oh gosh infrastructure but when we talk about election infrastructure we're talking about a couple of things right there are a list of names um their accounting systems they're reporting systems can you help us understand these different categories\nSure there are various administrative and technological process these we'd go into running elections as you can imagine and I'm elections uses technology just like any other government or private sector area and when we when we talk about elections infrastructure we're talking about an entire ecosystem of technology that we need\nI usually simplified down to three basic area's\nFirst um maintaining the voter lists themselves in every state or other than North Dakota voter lists are maintained\nAnd um those voter records need to be maintaining a database and be accessible and not just to the state election authorities but also to the local election authorities so big an update that information and then that information needs to be transferred sometimes and an electronic pull book which can look like a laptop\nOr that goes to the polling place to allow poll workers to check voters in on election day so that's that's the first main area of technology that's used in elections the ... second\nDatabase and be accessible not just to the state election authorities but also to the local election authorities so they can update that information and then that information needs to be transferred sometimes in an electronic poll book which can look like a laptop\nOr that goes to the polling place to allow poll workers to check voters in on election day so that's that's the first main area of technology that's used in elections\nThe ... second is um [noise] uh the all the technology that comes around\nCasting and counting the ballots so about eighty percent of people in the United states can cast ballots on paper those paper ballots are often fed into um large tabulate there's a that might look like large copy machines for instance that feed these documents and read all of the ballot markings on them so they can count them\nOr some people still vote on touch screen machines a and there's technology inside of those that allows those ballots to be counted as well\nSo that's the second big area of technology and then the last theory of technology is once the polls close on election day everyone pretty much expects\nElection results to be delivered out immediately and as a courtesy or election administrators try to get those results out on official though they may be as quickly as they can to voters and to the media and that system that election results system is another area of technology that's used in the in the entire election process\nI'm Talking about election infrastructure like David Becker and that's basically everything from how you registered how you cast your ballot to how it gets counted\nWe hear a lot about the the voter rolls and you talked about maintenance of those list who is in charge of maintaining these less because we're hearing a lot about people including here in New York City where some voters got letters saying that they were taken off list or they weren't eligible to vote\nHow does that happen why is there's so much confusion at that stage\nThe state usually takes responsibility all of the county to play a very large role in that and one of the real challenges\nLot about the the voter rolls and you talked about maintenance of those list who is in charge of maintaining these less because we are hearing a lot about people including here in New York City where some voters got letters saying that they were taken off list or they weren't eligible to vote how does that happen why is there's so much confusion at that stage\nWill the state usually takes responsibility all of the counties play a very large role in that and one of the real challenges is\nUm and I've done research in ... for for many many years\nIs that Americans are highly mobile they move between elections and election officials don't get very good information on that and I think most election officials would agree we want all of the eligible people to vote in on the on the list\nBut we also want to make sure that if someone has moved out of New York for instance or moved out of your state that they can be easily removed from the list and there are federal laws that govern that as well\nSo getting really good information on when someone has moved or when someone has died and making sure you get it right can be very very challenging and I'm there as I said federal laws that govern this um and there is an additional a um a a tool that election officials can use in some states New York doesn't put twenty four other states do\nIt's called the electronic registration Information Center Eric for short and I led the effort to create that and it allows election officials to get much better information much higher quality information on when a voter might have moved out of their state or within their state or died since the last election\nYou know I'm Wondering also I'm David why don't we have a system that and I know we've heard about this a lot of folks will talk about this but why don't isn't there a system where folks are automatically registered to vote when they turn Eighteen\nThere are a what we lack in the United states in what many other countries have is a some kind of official registry of citizens we don't have one magic list in the United states where all citizens are on there with up to date information given point in time so I'm often the best data\nIsn't there a system where folks are automatically registered to vote when they turn Eighteen\nSo there are a what we lack in the United states in what many other countries have is a some kind of official registry of citizens we don't have one magic list in the United states where all citizens are on there with up to date information given point in time\nSo I'm often the best database in a state of who might be eligible vote is the motor vehicles database but that's in complete sometimes it's not up to date\nBut it is the best one in many states um had been moving towards taking the information that citizens provide them at motor vehicles and automatically or\nTransferring that information into the voter lists and um that can be a very very effective tool to not only get new voters on the list but even more importantly keeping those that are already on the list with up to date information so election officials not to contact them\nYeah twenty Seventeen just before leaving office the ah the the former department of homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson designated this election infrastructure as critical infrastructure and I'm Wondering if this infrastructure is so critical why does it seem to be broken in some areas",
