construction company like why did they do\nAnd mark ... the latest investigation from the Trump ink pod cast team takes us deep or behind the scenes of the Trump Organization in a report that reveals a disturbing pattern of deception and fraud here's candy and Ivanka with our partner the take\nAway so one of the questions we have is what is the Trump Organization is it a real estate company is it a construction company like what did they do so the Trump Organization starts out building buildings which is what Donald Trump's bother Fred had done\nThen Donald Trump diversify his and he goes into casinos they sort of number of developments and he runs into an awful lot of trouble with the banks because his project start failing banks don't want to lend to him so that starts this new thing\nAround the beginning of this century where he starts licensing his name and that's the way that the Trump Organization has always presented\nWe license our name we don't actually do the construction not what we found is that\nDonald Trump and his children even kind on junior in particular would go around and they would imply to people that their family had\nEquity stakes ownership stake in projects\nAnd that the sales of these projects were going fantastically\nNinety percent soul sold out these are the kinds of terms that were being used when in fact they didn't have an ownership stake they weren't sold out the window the purchased restructured was it they would get their fees no matter what so they would get paid the projects would frequently fail\nAnd people who had invested in them bought in would lose their money\nAnd the Trump move onto another project\nAnd say the same thing we had begun to see this in various projects but what we didn't realize was how consistent it was the fact that it's a pattern was what was alarming to us because it suggests\nThat it is a business model it's not just a fluke is not just a project or a couple of projects gone bad\nFail and people who had invested in them bought in would lose their money and the terms would move onto another project and say the same thing we had begun to see this in various projects but what we didn't realize was how consistent it was the fact that it's a pattern was what was alarming to us because it suggests\nThat it is a business model it's not just a fluke is not just a project or a couple of projects gone bad\nAnd there's a about a dozen deals that you guys focus on in this episode and in particular there's one and the Trump ocean club in Panama City sounds a little bit about why that's so important\nSo the pen deal caught our attention for a few reasons one is that Panama is a place in the world that has a\nLow rating on scales of corruption meaning that it is very corrupt at the time the Trump Organization got in Transparency International rated it worse for example than Saudi Arabia very low worse than India\nSo this is a country that is also known for being a place where various narco traffickers want to run their money money laundering and want to run their money because there's all of this banking secrecy and Panama this is a project that went bankrupt\nAnd we have we serve on earth through this extraordinary process our colleagues at ProPublica on earth the audio tape up your bunker Trump in an interview she did in two thousand and eight where she was asked about this project\nThat we have any projects or at least I had a ... it's filled with salt over Ninety percent of it and I always felt that five hundred percent premium anything the luxury marketed ever experienced prior to our entry\nNone of those things were true and although the interview was published the audio has never been heard before and you can hear how this mechanism works and it's okay to say\n... it's filled with salt over Ninety percent of it and how we solve it five hundred percent premium anything the luxury marketed ever experienced prior to our entry\nNone of those things were true and although the interview was published the audio has never been heard before and you can hear how this mechanism works and it's okay to say I'm going to build the world's best building I'm going to build\nA such a beautiful building everybody's going to want to buy and there's actually a concept illegal kinds of notice ... free which is fine you can say that it's when you start to make\nSpecific material representations and you do it repeatedly that it becomes a question of whether there was actually a criminal fraud committed here now having said that a lot of this stuff happened a long time ago very far away\nSo there are all kinds of questions have jurisdiction there are questions of statute of limitation\nBut I think what this deep dime has done is really sort of make it clear to us that these are not fluke situations but there are actually a feature of the Trump business model and they sort of\nReally changed the way that we view this licensing model which seemed like a really great idea of no banks when ... you're just sell your name you don't have to worry about getting the financing\nI personally have never visited a dispensary and and yeah by county I don't know what I mean the Tories but\nPatients are still at risk a prosecutor recently re filed charges in Navajo county against one medical marijuana card holder citing the Jones decision the Maricopa County attorney's office says it's not prosecuting anyone yet\nWhat reason for that is Jennifer wealth and she and her husband went to court five years ago so they could give their young son Zander canvas extracts for his seizures and they won\nFor it said now become illegal which really it is illegal right now based on that ruling I have parents that are scared to give their kids their medicine\nWilton son has since passed away but she now runs a charity and advocates for others in her situation it's devastating she says that this is still an issue\nWhy didn't they use our cases ruling to bring that to the front just because you don't understand how it works doesn't mean it doesn't work doesn't mean that we shouldn't have access to it\nAppeals court

decision though takes precedence until the Supreme Court weighs in\nArizona is a cautionary tale about the possible fallout of using the ballot instead of state legislators to craft marijuana reform law's says Rob Mike as he's a law professor at Vanderbilt University and says these measures aren't always comprehensive you're opening the door\nTo those opponents to sort of revisit the issue and exploit those gas\nMichigan for example only clarified in twenty sixteen what was legal in their state years after voters passed their medical marijuana measure might go says many lawmakers don't want to get ahead of these disputes\nWay to practice problem these gaps between the the letter and spirit of these marijuana reforms is to have them addressed first and foremost by legislatures that know how to write legislation that can anticipate all those problems that might come up\nThat did not happen in Arizona in fact a bill aimed at fixing the problem earlier this year never got a hearing Will Stone kj ... News Phoenix\nAnd now for an update on the impending legal fight I'm joined by cage ACTs well some good morning well good morning Lauren so you say this case is heading to the state Supreme Court we've heard clearly some prosecutors believe these candidates cannabis products are illegal but\nWhat do we know that the state's position on this day she said they haven't pulled people like Alex ... who sell lane who sell medical marijuana to stop right\nRight Laura and they haven't told a dispensary owners do anything different the Arizona department of health services has said it's monitoring the case but hasn't given in other direction um now that doesn't stop individual prosecutors around the state from enforcing the appeals court decision but really a key figure in all of this is the attorney\nSaid they haven't pulled people like Alex ... who sell lane who sell medical marijuana to stop right\nThat's right Laura and they haven't told a dispensary owners do anything different\nThe Arizona department of health services has said it's monitoring the case but um hasn't given in other direction um now that doesn't stop individual prosecutors around the state from in forcing the appeals court decision but really a key figure and all of this is the attorney general\nUh this this start this case began and you have high county as we discuss in the story but when he was appealed the attorney general's office took over and argued that the conviction of Rodney Jones should stand and therefore sided with the lower courts interpretation that candidates extracts are illegal I mean that was a split decision from the appeals court\nNow the attorney for Rodney Jones has asked the Supreme Court to review the case and we're waiting to hear what the court intends to do\nDo they do we know if they will take the\nCase it seems very likely the court will or because of the case\nHas such broad implications as we are discussing and there's been disagreement and the courts about what is the correct interpretation but just yesterday afternoon we got some news on the case\nThat makes it seem you know even more likely the course the court will take it on rights ... tell us about the new attorney general mark burden of inches off as a took a surprising change of direction earlier this month\nHis office had told the Supreme Court to denied the review the case and that was partly because of some technicalities and that not all the facts and the case we're clear but his office also made a pretty forceful argument in those filings against candidates extracts saying they fall under the criminal code\nAnd the quote you know the court of appeals opinion was correct um and that seemed to signal they intended to take a hard line on the issue a pretty much following the lead of a ... as we heard in the story of but then just yesterday Bernard which is office a weed through all those arguments and said actually the state believes law enforcement\nMeant in those filings against candidates extracts saying they fall under the criminal code\nAnd the quote you know the court of appeals opinion was correct um and that seemed to signal they intended to take a hard line on the issue a pretty much following the lead of a shield Polk as we heard the story but then just yesterday Bernard which is office a weed through all those arguments\nAnd said actually the state believes law enforcement would benefit from the court weighing in on the issue\nWow so does that mean da da and tend to side with the medical marijuana industry\nIt's tuned to to say that Lauren or this was a procedural move whether or not the the court would take the case um but it did acknowledge that you know the matter was unsettled\nAnd I spoke with a Bernie beaches office and was told it signals you know they don't want this decided on a technicality and in fact it sounds like Bernard ... never really signed off on the original request from his office asking the court to denied the review\nSo you know this reversal could indicate a softening perhaps of the state's positioning position we don't know yet if this actually means burn a vigil drop the arguments against candidates extraction court or we'll we'll just have to wait and see\nI ... wells down well thanks so much thank you learn\n\nGood Tuesday Morning actually something of a show here on the one point five ... sees

attention to police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem show more credit twist on athletes and protests\nThat concept as the focus of a panel tonight or Phoenix art museum being hosted by ASU global sport Institute\nWith me to talk about this kind of structure CEO of the global sport Institute Ken how much has protesting by athletes changed now that we're in an age where many pros at least in team sports make millions of dollars how much more current athletes potentially sacrificing by protests\nBut I I think the major sacrifice the biggest sacrifice we we ever saw was model Ali who gave up his boxing title world championship title late sixties to protest against the Vietnam War\nAnd certainly millions of dollars in in a couple of years of last time of\nA possible success I think it's even more impactful when you are doing that your job growth it's obviously with um the victory stand there wasn't a whole big pro tracks are committed and have a lot immediately to lose but over the years fifty years if you hear them talk about the sacrifices but that force them to make\nSo Kaepernick uh I think that it it striking the amount of money but that he knew he was risking\nTheir opportunity today to have more people try what Ali did\nOr what's happened is doing now because people will often bring up the big names and I'll bring up Michael Jordan Tiger Woods for example um did they talk enough about issues like this regardless what side they're on to to talk enough about him LeBron James does but I don't know if he is because you the greatest player in the air\nHe was risking is their opportunity today to have more people try what Ali did\nOr what happened is doing now is people often bring up the big names and I'll bring up Michael Jordan Tiger Woods for example\nUm did they talk enough about issues like this regardless of what side they're on did they talk enough about him LeBron James does but I don't know if he is it gives you the greatest player in the NBA maybe in history the MBA he can say some things that others can't do you think more more players of stature in status should speak out about this kind of thing\n[noise] yes [laughter] it but you know if you look the timeline that was hoping you think about who really influenced Michael Jordan and tell you what it was people like Arnold Palmer Jack Nicholas ... race was a political were just golfers\nAnd think about the long term success they had an endorsement market so the message was very clear if you're going to be successful and even for a moment you know historically it's probably like look back at OJ OJ famously said I'm not black and white I'm oj\nI always kind of an extraordinary path to take him he had all kinds of problems after that but but that was that was the frame of mind\nI'm liberal on it really bothers people we talked about today LeBron really is the the breakthrough model in terms of uh yeah I'm at the high point to a lot I could lose financially but I'm going to say what I feel I Need to say and also when you look at the problem more closely ... he actually took time to educate themselves about the issues\nBefore he started speaking about it when the Beijing Olympics were taking place if you ask about\nA worker treatment workers in Tibet and and that sort of thing and he said and I don't know anything about it and then in some ways we were taken aback by that moment it was really the case that he didn't know anything about it and he didn't want to say anything but the issues that came up when he first left the Miami Heat\nEducate themselves about the issues before he started speaking about it when the Beijing Olympics were taking place you ask about\nA worker treatment workers in Tibet and and that sort of thing and he said I don't know anything about it\nAnd then in some ways we were taken aback by that particular moment it was really the case that he didn't know anything about it and he didn't want to say anything with the issues that came up when he first left the Miami Heat and protesting um uh the the activities round the Trayvon Martin in uh uh the the sad case in the trial around that\nThat that he really didn't didn't have to do that but I think there was an issue that he understood directly and that really catapulted him back to Cleveland and otherwise in terms of an engaging in speaking out on issues\nWhat about the concept of shut up and fly what\nJob training things that people who have access to treatment\nThe next step what do they need after they get treated for their addiction they need a job they need a place to live\nAnd so a state like Massachusetts was able to use this emergency money in that way yeah that makes sense so like you mentioned Arizona was one of the thirty three states that took the Medicaid expansion how do we compare to other states in terms of how the money's been filled out here\nWell Arizona got quite a bit of money about ... point two million dollars and the first year of the ground and only us eleven states receive more grant money than Arizona and that's because\nThis grant money was doled out with a formula that favored states that had um a higher need for opioid addiction treatments and they had more overdoses and more people that\nWere the need was on that in comparison with other states Arizona spent the money more slowly than many other states\nOr in the first year which was ending at the end of April I Believe Arizona spend about five point three million dollars or about forty four percent of its funds that were available now Arizona will still be able to spend this money and the second year of the grant\nSo our reporting found that this is not necessarily a bad thing that state spent the money more slowly that my\nWhich was ending at the end of April I Believe Arizona spend about five point three million dollars or about forty four percent of its funds that were available now Arizona will still be able to spend this money and the second year of the grant\nSo our reporting found that this is not necessarily a bad thing that state spent the money more slowly that might need some more reporting on the ground in Arizona to find out how the money is being spent [noise]\nBut I can see from the Arizona agency that administers the ... it's the Arizona healthcare costs containment system I can see that they have a plan for spending the\nMoney they are focusing on the people who are being released from jails and prisons they want to provide support for new mothers to help them in the recovery\nWith opiate addiction they want to expand residential treatment and recovery home services\nSo they have a plan for spending this money and um it will be interesting to continue to watch in the second year how much of the money goes out the door and goes to these providers that are doing this work\nRight right so I'm looking forward then at some point this money will be gone in states across the board and then the question sort of becomes how do we keep things going how do we continue to treat this if this crisis presumably isn't going anywhere what her state's planning on doing looking into the future are there any plans set out in some states\nThat's a really good question and that's a concern of people who are providing treatment out there as well this grant money go away and so there is some recent good news a Congress again passed legislation just recently just a\nA less than three weeks ago passed what's called the support for patients and communities act and President Trump has expressed\n[noise] that's a really good question and that's a concern of people who are providing treatment out there as well this grant money go away on so there is some recent good news a Congress again passed legislation just recently just a\nA less than three weeks ago passed what's called the support for patients and communities act and\nPresident Trump is expected to sign the measure maybe as soon as this week and that reauthorize the cures that grants you're twenty Twenty one\nSo we know that states will continue to get this money at least they're twenty Twenty one and there will be continued efforts that vary from state to state again on how this money is that\nFor example a state could spend a lot of the money on providing the locks on overdose reversal kits to law enforcement I think that's happening in Arizona\nAnd there's just a variety of ways that states are able to spend this money and we'll just have to continue watching to see how much of it really gets to the
