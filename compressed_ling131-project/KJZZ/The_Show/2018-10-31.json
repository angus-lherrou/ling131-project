into this and he joins us now good morning Craig mourning mourning so let's start with this archaeologist who used to work for the state parks department um tell us a little bit about him and what he's claiming here\nWill doctor will Russell uh from all accounts that I've had as a very well respected archaeologist he got his PHD from Arizona State university a very well respected in his field and also from a stokes around the state [noise] um he had raised a newer concerns that\nAre still blocked the parks director and other folks at parks or destroying a Native American archaeological sites\nIn order to build trails to build cabins and basically to make money and when he raised those concerns he was shut down\nSo this is not the first a complaint against soon black remind us a little bit of the history that you've been reporting on for quite some time here\n[noise] well the other complaints of all this this is actually this has triggered a fourth investigation against a

this one is a little bit more serious in that you actually have a person alleging that she broke the law and um all the other allegations were that she just was a bad boss\nThis is actually that she and her deputy Jim Keegan are being accused of breaking the law and committing a potentially felonies and what you had have now is you have for Native American legislators and they're all Democrats that are in the minority party um are calling for her firing 'em so\nYou know typically when someone's in the minority party and they ask a ... a governor and the majority party to do something it doesn't go much but these were legislators also have a great deal of clout or in their tribes and so that makes a big difference\nIf they don't vote will count\nIf they don't vote will count won't count until the ballot is validated by the voter and that process it varies county by county some counties make more times than others to let the voter no there is an issue with their ballot\nI'm a number of ballot or turned in on election day they don't necessarily identify them that match or how the resort to take the calls on election day um and so for ballots that are on or near election day my understanding is that a number of counties are not making any contact whatsoever with the voter\nDaniel ... is an attorney with the campaign Legal Center a D.C based nonprofit that works to

they found out more than twenty six hundred mail in ballots were not counted in the twenty sixteen election in Arizona because of his signature mismatch\nOf course voters can check in with every quarters officers themselves to make sure their vote was in fact counted but ... says the oldest should be on the county used to inform voters and in the weeks since they're letter went out to counties Maricopa in Coconino sided with them\nMaricopa County recorder Adrian ... says his office will continue the calls and emails after seven pm on election day\nSo normally early ballots are uh\nMostly ... before we get to the end of election day we've had a huge turnout so I'm hoping that we'll be able to get all of that worked on but then during the course of the day on Wednesday after election day will be going through a bachelor of time and making sure that we get all those validated that we can\nScientists as in previous elections they gave up to chase after seven pm on election

thousand people attended\nStopped or Jerry Rabinowitz from squirrels hill was also buried as lines of mourners stretched around city blocks and then on Tuesday Afternoon President Trump arrived in

letter read the country often looks to leadership in times of tragedy in someone who can identify with those morning and helped direct the nation towards the higher better place to place the feeling\nThe President Trump appears unable or unwilling to play that role\nI think historians will be extremely critical of the way that Donald Trump reacted to this worst attack on Jewish Americans in worshipped him two hundred years\nMichael Beschloss it the presidential historian and author most recently of presidents of\nWar and he spent his career researching and writing about the roles and expectations of the president's the\nPresident's award time have always had to go to funerals console the families of soldiers were falling on the battlefield because of their own decisions and that's one reason you've always wanted to have presidents with empathy for instance\nAbraham Lincoln during the civil war was told that there has to be a National Cemetery a new one because\nSo many soldiers were dying and Lincoln said put that cemetery right near my summer home so that I could see the union graves being dug I wanted to see the results of the terrible decisions I'm making that are creating an ocean of blood and also I Want to be able to console the widows\n... and you know we mentioned you mentioned Abraham Lincoln I Want to move the clock forward to Ronald Reagan and how he dealt with national tragedies I'm thinking specifically about the explosion of the challenger space shuttle in Nineteen eighty six that I remember clearly\nRonald Reagan was almost designed for this role of a president consoling the nation after a tragedy Nineteen\nWhere does ... and you know we mentioned you mentioned Abraham Lincoln I Want to move the clock forward to Ronald Reagan and how he dealt with national tragedies I'm thinking specifically about the explosion of the challenger space shuttle in Nineteen eighty six that I remember clearly\nRonald Reagan was almost designed for this role of a president consoling the nation after a tragedy Nineteen eighty six Americans saw with their own eyes the challenger accident\nAnd Ronald Reagan gave a speech late that day that was one of the best written speeches probably in the history of the president's he's talking about what America aspired to in the space program and giving some context to what had happened that morning\nAnd I want to say something to the school children of America we're watching the live coverage of the shuttle steak I Know it's hard to understand but sometimes painful things like this happen it's all part of the process of exploration and discovery\nIt's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons the future doesn't belong to the faint hearted belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future\nAnd will continue to fall\nWe also are thinking about other presidents since Reagan what comes to mind is the Oklahoma City bombing and Bill Clinton's response to that\nYou have lost too much but you have not lost everything and you have certainly not lost America\nFor we will stand with you for as many tomorrow's [noise] how would you assess that\nWell the interesting thing that was in the spring of Nineteen Ninety five and Bill Clinton at that time was a very controversial president he had just lost both houses of Congress\nAnd you have certainly not lost America for we will stand with you for as many tomorrow's [noise] how would you assess that\nWell the interesting thing that was in the spring of Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd Bill Clinton at that time was a very controversial president he had just lost both houses of Congress so this is not someone who was considered to be a hugely popular leader but when he gave a speech explaining what had happened in Oklahoma City and trying to\nTell Americans that American history shows that we get over these things it made it more of a president\nNow I also want to bring up George W. Bush who had um what I recall we're sort of two very different experiences with with really consoling the nation one was after Katrina\nStabilize the situation\nYou know again I I Want to thank you offer and brownie you're doing a heck of a job\nAt the same or directors working\nNot not his finest hour\nNot is finest hour lots of Americans felt that he was being insensitive right to the plight of those who had suffered but then there was nine eleven [noise]\nWe were frankly quite surprised to realize that there is no consensus definition of safety of safety in general a safety in transportation or of safety for autonomy vehicles so we had to choose a definition\nAnd we focused on eliminating minimizing are managing harm to the public with a focus on people as opposed to property your animals\nWhat standard of safety should autonomous vehicles be held to because it seems as though the equipment the technology is much more at play than in a traditional car where a driver can maybe compensate for a problem within the vehicle itself\nOne reason why people are so excited about economists vehicles is because they promise greater safety than human driven conventional vehicles so there are what order or thirty five forty thousand\nMotor vehicle accidents in this country annually that's a good target to try to reduce if not a lemonade\nEven though in this country with human driven conventional vehicles accidents are\nGreater safety and human driven conventional vehicles so there are what order or thirty five forty thousand motor vehicle accidents in this country annually that's a good target to try to reduce if not eliminate\nEven though in this country with human driven conventional vehicles accidents are comparatively uncommon\nSo most people want to compare\nAutomated vehicle with a human driven conventional vehicle\nThat sometime as possible and sometimes not but\nOverall the expectation is going to be that these vehicles will be safer so even apps and a specific standard that is the expectation\nDo you think that that is the standard that the public and policymakers are looking it\nI don't think people expect that there'll be no collisions are accidents but there is an expectation that there will be fewer but a factor in addition to the technology is that we need a safety culture are there are certain\nFeatures safety features software futures technology features that you think every autonomous vehicles should or must have before does allowed on the road\nOur focus was ON Technology\nNeutral company neutral views of safety so that's a complicated way of saying that we recognize companies will build their vehicles in different ways and they will still have functioning\nAnd save vehicles as a result so the existing federal motor vehicle safety standards do call for certain features and they are\nPretty so that's a complicated way of saying that we recognize companies will build their vehicles in different ways and they will still have functioning\nAnd save vehicles as a result so the existing federal\nMotor vehicle safety standards do call for certain features and they are addressing lower level forms of safety like\nAutomated emergency braking systems but we were looking at the more highly automated systems and those vehicles would incorporate the regular features and they would have\nMore sophisticated\nAutomated driving systems that are the more integrated systems\nFrom what you can tell how close are we to having autonomous vehicles really be a some significant portion of fleets on the road I mean obviously they're doing a lot of testing both here in the Phoenix area and elsewhere do you have a sense of of when we might see a more broad commercial roller\nIn terms of a significant proportion on the road we have a ways to go but in terms of some kind of commercial presence\nI think we're close to seeing that in very specific circumstances so shuttles that work on a campus that kind of very limited function\nMore likely to see something faster than four vehicles that are operating in a congested urban area\nHow important is public perception in this whole field and how important is it that the public feels as though there are adequate safety and other policy questions resolved before they are really ready to accept autonomous vehicles\nFaster than four vehicles that are operating in a congested urban area\nHow important is public perception in this whole field and how important is it that the public feels as though there are adequate safety and other policy questions resolved before they're really ready to accept autonomous vehicles\nI think it's very important the testing to date while it has been growing is still relatively small but people who are on a public road do not want to feel like there are some kind of guinea pig in an experiment they want to feel that they can go about their business and not\nIncurred or some kind of safety challenged so the public needs to understand and to have confidence\nThe vehicles around them again are above some kind of threshold when it comes to safety\nMarjorie Blumenthal is a senior policy analyst and director of the science technology and policy program at the RAND Corporation\nAnd while we're waiting for autonomy vehicles to emerge from their testing and become regular fixtures on the road there are other transportation options round the valley there's light rail and bus service has longer hours and more opportunities to get around town\nBut the way this place has been built in designing yes with our sprawl the automobile dominate how we move from point a to point B and there are a lot of parking lots and garages so how could all of that change when autonomy cars are dominating the roads and the landscape our co host Steve gold scene looked into this and he's here with us good morning\nLord of the morning yes I talk with their input fruit trees and architecture and urban as professor tissue focuses on design are started by asking her dramatic change we're going to get our cities Phoenix a particular as fewer people are doing their own driving and there's less need to find a parking space because we may simply get dropped off by the ...\nI think it's going to be in our life\nEating rallies and landscape ... looked into this and he's here with us good morning\nLauren good morning yes I talk with Darren ... and architecture and urban isn't professor to su focuses on design I started by asking how dramatic change we're going to see in our cities Phoenix a particular as fewer people are doing their own driving and there's less need to find a parking space because we may simply get dropped off by ...\nI think it's going to be in our lifetime one of the most significant changes to the urban form that we've seen um [noise]\nIf you think about the history of cities uh after the war after World War two you can imagine that we began with a kind of metropolitan a form that was predicated on oil and driving and moving out into the suburbs and expanding the city from a a downtown or a core\nThat's not necessarily true for Phoenix but most cities United States and then in the seventies when we started having problems with oil and gas prices and things this the metropolitan field starting to become more fragmented\nSo we called it a fragment of metropolis\nAnd really where we are now is this notion that the city becomes an archipelago of density and Phoenix is actually a well suited to that because in the seventies they developed the Polly centric planned on the village is planned for the for the city and was really a forward thinking city relative to\nThe notion of how do we occupy a large area\nAnd during what am I parking garages parking lot to particular we've got a lot of those around the valley\nA ton of us driving um it's inevitably realized I think what you're going to start to see is one uh cities that have a lot of parking are going to have incredible opportunity for development because that parking will become reduced\nAnd a cities that have wide streets like Phoenix Las Vegas and other mostly postwar cities or will also have an incredible opportunity because the number of vehicles on the road might be less because we'll be very efficient however with any drop\nI just I think what you're going to start to see is one a city that have a lot of parking are going to have incredible opportunity for development because that parking will become reduced\nAnd a cities that have wide streets like Phoenix Las Vegas in other mostly postwar cities\nOr will also have an incredible opportunity because the number of vehicles on the road might be less because we'll be very efficient however winning you drop off lanes and pick up lanes for high traffic times\nAnd the shape of so so the ability for those streets to become reshaped without encroaching on private property is a really big deal\nHow innovative do you think people are prepared to be when it comes to this because one of the things I've I've heard often is will be more places that are environmentally friendly we'll have more parks which sounds delightful ... but in other words it doesn't really sound economically productive which of course has been so much tied to\nOur streets and our parking and whatnot yeah no so there's always these moments in history when you move to what\nWe might call a smooth space\nSo for example um you know the turn of the century you had wagons and forces in the street\nAnd then and and pedestrians and they just kind of moved through the street there was some sidewalks\nAh and then a car is brought along and now you've got cars sitting horses and all kinds of things happening and that ... that previously smooth space of everybody kind of going where they want turns into a stride its base meaning that it's it's compartments here's the link for the car here's the late for the horse here's where the pedestrians walk [noise]\nAnd what happens with that is that those are inevitable a controls to manage the chaos that might ensue\nBut at that always happens always at a moment where the new technology has brought in like the automobile is always that moment of chaos there's always that moment where everything's in that smooth space and I think that's going to be what we're gonna see coming up\nLane for the cars there's a link for the horse here's where the pedestrians walk [noise] and what happens with that is that those are inevitable a controls to manage the chaos that might ensue [noise]\nBut at that always happens always at a moment where the new technology has brought in like the automobile is always that moment of chaos there's always that moment where everything's in that mood space\nAnd I think that's going to be what we're gonna see coming up is this kind of smooth urban condition where you're going to have a ton of miss driving a little bit with some people driving their own cars or maybe we'll see it with trucking first and then dedicated lanes et cetera\nUh but if you combine that with automobiles that are not petroleum based whether it be hydrogen or electric now you're completely transform either way you engage a building you could drop people off in the building\nA more than half of buildings footprints are typically given a parking so it's already got an infrastructure for bringing the car inside you could imagine how that will transform completely\nCertainly the folks or conversations about more urbanized areas but I Wonder if this could even grow that the contrast between urban and rural settings in a sense of let's say people in rural settings with\nIf we still have the Seventy five mile an hour freeway or what not you're going to see people maybe want to hold onto their cars in that sense do you expect to see designs take hold in in rural areas and just as much slower paced or maybe not even at all\nYeah it's a really good question so the couple a couple of things I Would say or a happening out there in the world with people considering these situations one is\nWith people considering these situations one is\nAnd and and and now you you you ... the ... ah ah releases the insulin the your blood sugar level jobs and then and then your body should they are going what\nWhere's my [laughter] and\nSo now All right so now your body is confused because it's got to drive your blood sugar backups and now it says you better each something [laughter] because I've I've got a ... a drop in blood sugar so it's it's

Phoenix with Lauren ... coming up this hour of Phoenix restaurant is opening up a new location in that location is generating some bugs and look at the changes in downtown Phoenix over the past few decades\nBut first a state report has found a lax oversight continues to allow parents to miss spend money from Arizona school voucher program joining us to discuss this report and why voters should pay attention is ... good morning good morning so give us a quick rundown first year of the state's voucher program and how it's supposed to work\nSo here the program is called empowerment scholarship accounts or e essays and program was first created and twenty eleven and it allows parents to take their kids out of public school and pay for an alternative with taxpayer dollars it's about Ninety percent of what would have gone to the school if they went to a public school\nThere is some limits on what the money can be used on for example tuition curriculum and therapy you can't just buy anything with this money\nRight and right now only select groups of kids are eligible including those with disabilities parents in the military and living on traveling and attending failing schools right\nBut that can actually change pretty soon proposition three o five gives voters the power to decide whether the voucher program is expanded to make all Arizona children eligible a yes vote is going to expand that program\nThere you can't just buy anything with this money right and right now only select groups of kids are eligible including those with disabilities parents in the military living on traveling and attending failing schools\nRight but that can actually change pretty soon proposition three o five gives voters the power to decide whether the voucher program is expanded to make all Arizona children eligible\nA yes vote is going to expand that program\nA no vote is going to keep it how it is right now\nOkay but in the meantime there are problems with the existing program yes and that's a what a report from the auditor general's office found one of the biggest takeaways the report identified is more than seven hundred thousand dollars in taxpayer dollars there was not spent according to the rules of the program\nAnd the state hasn't been able to recoup most of that money\nJeff go works in the auditor general's office and he worked on this report\nOr not [noise] stuff medically monitor program to look for unusual may be going\nSo how is the department's opposed to stop this from happening well there's some controls built in for example you can withdraw money from these debit cards and there are certain retailers where the transactions won't even go through and the first place\nBut on top of that parents have to submit expense reports that show how they spent the money but what the report found was that when there were suspicious activity like if people try to take out money multiple times or spend money in weird places\nNo one from the department of education was following up right okay and what are the consequences than for breaking the rules you're supposed to receive a warning and eventually get kicked out of the program but the report also found that that policy wasn't always enforce either\nSo the department of education is supposed to be in charge of all of this what was their response to this report superintendent dying Douglas says the legislature has underfunded their department basically they don't have enough freezer\nUp right okay and what are the consequences than for breaking the rules you're supposed to receive a warning and eventually get kicked out of the program\nBut the report also found that that policy wasn't always enforced either so the department of education is supposed to be in charge of all of this what was their response to this report superintendent dying Douglas says the legislature has underfunded their department\nBasically they don't have enough resources or manpower to run the school voucher program effectively so for example and fiscal year twenty Eighteen they were supposed to get two point six million dollars to kind of administer the program manager at work with parents\nAnd they actually eat on the top of the grave but here in the south west a lot of people have migrated here so the graves are not here like ... one of the few people whose ancestors are buried here and it makes a cemetery\nSo that's why we created a new way of celebrating which is in a park it's open to everybody and it's that celebrates this beautiful tradition in a community setting this seems like such a a\nIdea especially here in modern day America right where it's like that is very final thing it's a sad thing like we wear black right at a un American\nHere and it makes a cemetery so that's why we created a new way of celebrating which is in a park it's open to everybody and it's a celebrates this beautiful tradition in a community setting\nThis seems like such a a foreign idea especially here in modern day America right where it's like that is very final thing it's a sad thing like we wear black right at a un American funeral what is it what what's the difference here and why is that important in terms of the celebration aspect of\nThis well this is it goes to the core of our humanity death is a universal phenomena\nEvery culture deals with the differently so\nUh in the American modern culture contemporary culture you put the pictures on the wall\nYour parents you know probably died in the old folks home you know in a rest home and it's very kind of like how to said has corporate way of dealing with it so what do we bring this richness of our humanity that we remember we remember our ancestors we talk about it and we celebrate them\nWe're not here just mourning and crying and for me sorry 'cause I lost my mum everybody's going to lose their mom and dad sooner or later you know\nBut the fact that I can celebrate and remember how wonderful she was the food that she liked the songs that she'd like to hear these things that she liked to do so that's the beauty of bringing in this kind of value and I think that's why I think race by so many people\nSo the idea of this holiday it seems as if it's becoming pretty popular right now like more popular than it has been in the past maybe because of the Disney movie Coco maybe because you're starting to see this kind of infiltrate pop culture in a way and I wonder how you feel about that I Know their voices out there\nThat are concerned about the watering down of this sort of like the American ...

watering down of this or like the American ... this holiday is that something that you two are worried about\nCoco was created because it was so popular why because our population has exploded the demographic has exploded culture is not something you record culture is something that you share and this is just one tiny part the tip of the iceberg of what is Mexico\nWhat it has been in the past what it is today and the Mexican diaspora\nWell we we've seen how it has spread ... people other cultures have embrace like he sets culture is not something that we heard something that we share so we like to share the fact that there's different ways of celebrating you'll be loved departed than this the way we do it we remember them we put flowers we dance amounted we think about it you know\nAnd this passion does love\nAnd I think that's in the highest expression of our humanity so it sounds like it's okay with you that this tradition changes over time\nWell yeah culture changes you know is not the same we don't live in a hotdog and we don't have access to thousands of flowers we just have a few flowers you know what I mean so it's a different kind of thing it's on the evolution you know they change is an inevitable\nWhat we see is people are appropriate ... of borrowing if you will or the images of the arc and not the iconography and using it to sell product\nWe use the imagery to

that series and she joins me and just go downtown Phoenix used to be kind of a role the sidewalks at five PM kind of place and that isn't really the case anymore so what were some of the biggest changes you and your colleagues identified\n[noise] you're so right there were so many over the course of three decades and in the eighties we weren't even sure that the downtown that we currently have was going to remain the downtown of Phoenix there are people saying why don't we just call twenty four straighten camel back downtown instead\nAnd so there has been very strategic visions over the last three decades to kind of get where we are and\nWe kind of set out to say okay what was the magic ingredient what was the one thing\nThat changed the course of downtown and the truth is is that there is not just one thing I think the most critical thing that's happened downtown is Arizona State university bringing a campus downtown with students who are forced to live there be they're going to the jobs yeah exactly\nBut had there not been other investments over two decades before ASU came down town I don't think as you would have ever made the move so you're talking light rail chase field the sun's arena\nThe uh city escape development the Arizona Center development the symphony I mean there were so many things over the course of Thirty years that have happened or that I think altogether brings us to you know the viable downtown we finally have again today\nCame down town I don't think as you would have ever made the move so you're talking light rail\nChase field the sun's arena\nThe uh city escape development the Arizona Center development the symphony I mean there were so many things over the course of thirty here that have happened or that I think all together bring it to you know the viable downtown we finally have again today who\nWas making these investments that seems like it wasn't just the city doing and it wasn't just private developers wasn't just the state was a really a partnership between those and maybe other entities as well\nIt was but I Would say that the vast majority of investment came from you and me and all of our colleagues are tax payers\nAnd or I suppose only if you live in Phoenix but uh you know over the course of the three decades that there were several bond elections that the city of Phoenix voters approved and you know I I think they deserve some credit because I think in the eighties to convince someone that downtown was going to be what it is today was probably a tough sell\nThat there was I mean we're talking about three billion dollars of public money pumped into downtown over the course of three decades\nThey're really the ones that funded the things like Britain bar library at the university campus at the light rail\nThe uh sports facilities there they're the ones we're the ones who have funded those things but over time of course private investment has kicked in when\nYou're talking about the investment made in downtown you mentioned three billion dollars how do city leaders determine whether or not they're getting a good enough return on investment\nIt's not an easy thing to quantify I Would say but if you look at the economic impact study is that they has a produced I think many people would say that\nIt stings but over time of course private investment has kicked in\nWhen you're talking about the investment made in downtown you mentioned three billion dollars how do city leaders determine whether or not they're getting a good enough return on investment\nIt's not an easy thing to quantify I Would say but if you look at the economic impact studies that they have a produced I think many people would say that it seems to be working at least to some extent there are sixty six thousand jobs in downtown Phoenix right now\nAnd that is triple what we had in Nineteen Ninety five we also almost have Thirteen thousand people living in the downtown core\nAnd in the mid nineties there were less than two thousand so there are things like that you can look at and say well you know it seems to be paying off whether the cost of the total investment it's worth it I mean you know we could have people debate that all day long\nWe have a specific center that's a designated for unaccompanied minors for example who have come to the city\nWe have a specific center that's a designated for unaccompanied minors for example who have come to the city and to also help their parents not only with ... but also with mental health services and other wraparound services that I think\nHave been very important in their integration\nAnd Linda and we also know that the office of refugee resettlement except that it expects that half of all the families separated by the U.S administration zero tolerance immigration policy will actually be detained in greater LA is the city prepared for that influx of folks\nWere very prepared we in fact coordinated a strategy with the county one of the things that we've done immediately because cities are first responders in many cases when we have you know populations that arrived\nIs to also provide legal representation and working with a local legal organizations that are representing\nSome of the families that have been reunified and we've also created under mayor or city and the county the LA justice fund which is a fund that provides legal assistance to immigrants asylum seekers a refugee populations domestic violence survivors\nWho are eligible for you know TVs or UV says so it's a public private partnership a

we've seen waves of migration continually\nDomestic violence survivors who are eligible for you know TVs are ... says so it's a public private partnership and that allows for people to get that legal representation especially those who are facing deportation\nAnd you know we we establish that this is not just a domestic issue this is an international issue and we've seen waves of migration continually not just coming here to the United states\nThroughout Central America throughout the ... you you know I mean this is not something that's going to stop in fact it might even increased given climate change and everything else that we've laid out\nI like to ask you both what do you think are the biggest challenges that cities will face in the next ten years hammer\nIs preparedness either number one ... you know like I mentioned the example of Kampala when I speak with city officials and told them but your city will be the biggest city in the world\nI'm about Thirty years they simply do not have the resources to deal with that\nThe point is it takes all hands on deck to think not just reactive we which is very much how I think the international system has worked but not being surprised when you see this amount of people show up on your doorstep because this is the trend as you mentioned and has been for for decades\nAnd Linda what about you what do you think that the biggest challenges cities will face over the next ten years\nHousing it's also access to education you know we're not going to see declines in the number of people that are arriving to destination cities like LA or New York or Chicago I think it's imperative that\nLeaders take that challenge and really create not only the infrastructure but also think through how other partners can come along
