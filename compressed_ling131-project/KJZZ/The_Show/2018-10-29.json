country that has been leading to this\n[noise] well I think it's important to recognize the one that we have a very long standing history of racism in this country obviously and\nOf white supremacists terrorism of this kind but particularly in recent years on particularly with the election\nOf the nation's first black President Obama we saw an increase in white supremacist activity an increase in the formation of a white supremacist hate groups and then of course the political ascendancy of um Donald Trump really has taken place with in that context of course he\nReally came to prominence as a political figure by um being one of the most outspoken people on this birther isn't conspiracy theory this idea that\nPresident Obama was born in another country which of course itself is a very racist motivation in that theory and so in this particular week\nThe week began with a bomb being sent to George Soros too\nOf course as frequently targeted not only by Donald Trump but in a lot of right wing political messaging and that itself carries a lot of anti Semitic undertones the sense that George Soros is funding um a lot of activist activity\nAnd the Donald Trump or Clinton himself a nationalist kind of this wink wink nod nod use of this term nationalist and then we had this spate of a white supremacist terrorist attack 'em and this all happened within the course of a week so I think the weakest thing\n... but in a lot of right wing political messaging and that itself carries a lot of anti Semitic undertone the sense that George Soros is funding um a lot of activist activity and the Donald Trump proclaimed himself a nationalist kind of this wink wink nod nod\nUse of this term nationalist and then we had this spate of a white supremacist terrorist attack on and it's all happened within the course of a week so I think the weakest significant for those events that we had been building to this for quite some time\nBruce I Want to bring you in here because they feel like often times you know we hear the word Bree just mentioned the word terrorism what is the actual definition of terrorism and domestic terrorism today and how do we see that being applied to the recent acts that we've just been discussing\nTerrorism is in my view is in a ... political it's always about an intention to intimidate co worse punish or otherwise influence someone by by violence or the threat of violence\nThere is a very specific legal definition I'm In the U.S code which in essence conforms to that but I think what what ... leaves people very confused as a there's a ... completely separate code for hate crimes\nTwo billion dollars into our economy\nSaving create thousands of jobs and provide healthcare hundreds of thousands of low income Arizona and\nHer coal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable CARE Act led to a contentious special session in which legislative Democrats and a handful of Republicans agreed to the plant\nForecasts at the time projected the roles to add three hundred thousand low income residents at the time of the expansion there were roughly one and a half million Arizona's enrolled in the state's Medicaid program known as access now there are more than one point eight million\nWe have a few perspectives on this five year anniversary starting with Greg ... he's president and CEO of the Arizona hospital and healthcare association which was one of the biggest advocates of the expansion plant and Greg from your perspective and your members perspective what's happened over the course of the past five years\nWell matters but it's played out as we thought it would in terms of the really direct impacts of Medicaid restoration an expansion than me one of course the rest of the world has been a pretty crazy in terms of a lost opportunity is really to move on from that point\nHi it's Phil Latzman and thank you for listening to kj ... online service which is supported by ... education foundations are proud sponsor of the cage ACC education desk he Leo's education foundation believes every student regardless of ZIP Code deserves a high quality education\nFind out more at ... dot org\nIs really to move on from that important policy to the bigger issues out there of how to really improve the health care system and lower costs for not just Arizona has been Americans\nAre hospitals doing better financially now that are more Arizona ... have a healthcare coverage under medicated\nYes absolutely back in twenty Thirteen hospitals are really struggling under the weight of the great recession and its impact on their own and especially uncompensated care costs\nWhat Medicaid restoration was about four hospitals verse was for patients but for their finances was to really lower that uncompensated care costs and that's been over three hundred million dollars a year less annually and that's really translated into stable operating margins and\nThe five percent range when a back twenty Thirteen there are more than one percent range which just isn't sustainable for any business\nOne of the arguments that hospitals and and you made at the time was that there are a lot of people coming into the ERs who don't have any insurance\nAnd that is about the most expensive way that that patients can be treated that hospitals or or the healthcare system can treat patients are we seeing fewer ER visits now that more people are covered with Medicaid\nI don't know if we're seeing fewer ER visits there's still a substantial amount for far too many people still their access to the medical care system but I Do have to believe we're seeing a lot more of the patients with serious medical needs are getting into primary care whether it's through the emergency room route or through just going directly to primary care and\n... are we seeing fewer ER visits now that more people are covered with Medicaid\nI don't know if we're seeing fewer ER is is there still a substantial amount for far too many people still their access to the medical care system but I Do have to believe we're seeing a lot more of the patients with serious medical needs are getting into primary care whether it's through the emergency room route or through just going directly to primary care\nAnd it's it's not just that it's expensive it's the worst possible care for people to get 'cause it's way too late if they're showing an emergency room with symptoms rather than the success stories are much more about what you can do when you get them in early and prevent things well\nIn terms of getting people into primary care have you seen an increase in physicians who are accepting Medicaid patients with more people on Medicaid\nUm I think we've seen an increase I think can be seen an increase across the system in many cases these patients are being seen within systems not necessarily solo practices which are going away as a phenomenon and just in Arizona but across the nation\nSo I think we're seeing patients movie much more to organize systems of care which was really a big part of what our unique Arizona medicate system access was all about\nWhat do you think the future holds I mean obviously there's been a lot of talk about what to do with the Affordable CARE Act and what to do with maybe work requirements or other kinds of stipulations put on Medicaid recipients I'm Wondering from your perspective what the future might look like\nWell that's the the sixty four million dollar question is probably more than that in fact there was a money remember back when Medicaid restoration was on the table we were never saying it was a panacea we're saying it was an important\nFirst or next step in terms of trying to rationalize our system at least trying to do it with most people in the system in terms of coverage rather than out we thought what we'd see over the last five six years it would be beginning to move on to these other issues and instead we've gotten embroiled in the same old contentious political arguments again\nWas on the table we were never saying it was a panacea we're saying it was an important\nFirst or next step in terms of trying to rationalize our system at least trying to do with most people in the system in terms of coverage rather than out\nWe thought we'd see over the last five six years it would be the beginning to move on to these other issues and instead we've gotten embroiled in the same old contentious political arguments again and I'm frankly we see no way out of that until we get some resolution as a federal level in terms of how we might really approach\nRationalizing the healthcare system really tackling it as a system instead of just those pieces\nGreg ... is president and CEO of the Arizona hospital in health care association during the debate over Medicaid expansion and Governor Brewer mentioned it in her state of the state address supporters talked about helping keep rural hospitals open by reducing the number of patients coming into their yards you didn't have any insurance\nRun MacArthur re CEO and some in healthcare regional medical center in show low and says uncompensated care at his hospital has dropped substantially since the Medicaid expansion\nWe've seen are bad debt ride offs five years ago they were running around twenty two twenty three million a year and they have been reduced now to Lebanon twelve million a year or so at ten million dollar decrease in the amount of bad debt ride off\nMacArthur says he's ease the safety net hospital for to low income Arizona counties Navajo an Apache he estimates a little less than half of the patients that come into his ER are covered by Medicaid and overall there's been a four percent increase in patients covered by the program up to twenty six percent\nBut he acknowledges the region could still use more physicians who except Medicaid patients\nTo Medicaid expansion of people without insurance for using our AR for primary care and that's where we had our biggest bad debt ride off we've we've reduced the ride off coming\nThan half of the patients that come into his ER are covered by Medicaid and overall there's been a four percent increase in patients covered by the program up to twenty six percent but he acknowledges the region could still use more physicians who accept Medicaid patients\nPrior to Medicaid expansion of people without insurance we're using our air for primary care and that's where we had our biggest bad debt ride off we've we've reduced the ride off coming from a A R but it's showing up in Medicaid contract shows and our position clinics and\nIn some of the other areas but a doctor's visits are a lot cheaper than hospital ER visits\nIn other words MacArthur says while the system is still losing some money it's better for that to happen in a doctor's office than the ER but critics of the Medicaid expansion say adding new enrollees hasn't had the positive benefits advocates envisioned\nAnd there'll be Lopez Baughman is director of health care policy at the Goldwater Institute which oppose the expansion five years ago it's been looking into the effects of that decision now she calls it a cautionary tale and joins me via Skype to talk more about that so Naomi from your perspective what has the impact bin of Arizona's Medicaid expansion now five years on\nThink is an important lesson for lawmakers and policymakers when they're considering Medicaid expansion when they're ... they're trying to figure out what that gifted at work and I think the big lesson is that we've got a judge apparently diets outcomes not by its intentions what we've done in Arizona is that\nThere was a lot of I'm shocked increases and hard just from the hospitals and ... a lot of the arguments that were made to sell Medicaid expansion is related to hospitals just didn't come to fruition in fact\nWe had a lot of unintended consequences and I think it's really important to evaluate these programs these efforts because there are lessons in store for other states as well as for the state of Arizona let me ask you about one of ...\nJust from the hospitals and you know do a lot of the arguments that were made to sell Medicaid expansion as it related to hospitals just didn't come to fruition in fact\nWe had a lot of unintended consequences and I think it's really important to evaluate these programs these efforts because there are lessons in store for other states as well as for the state of Arizona\nMe ask you about one of the biggest arguments that advocates made a back in twenty Thirteen which is that obviously if you expand Medicaid more people will be covered and hospitals will have to treat fewer uninsured patients\nAnd even though Medicaid doesn't pay costs getting something for treating a patient is better than getting nothing in hospitals are saying now that's essentially what happened is that in your mind not a a positive for hospitals and then for the health care industry more broadly\nWhat do we want people to have insurance and I think that's really important goal\nI think it's um that we can all agree on for the problem is is that the Medicaid program is one size fits all and different\nYou know the ... the original Medicaid population is usually the disabled population is very different than the expansion population but yet they all have to\nFit under the same type of Medicaid and ... and it really is an ... a very awkward inexpensive way to provide insurance and in many cases actually doesn't meet\nThe healthcare needs and preferences of those people that the program as opposed to serve\nYou mentioned that there have been some unintended consequences I'm Wondering if you could sort of share with us what what those are and you know sort of what the impact or those has been certainly\nSimple Medicaid expansion errors in a hospital or charging looks like oh here's even more today than they were before expansion so as we know the idea that the cost for the uninsured were being passed along to private hairs was made but\nConsequences I'm Wondering if you could sort of share with us what what those are and you know sort of what the impact of those has been\nCertainly simple Medicaid expansion errors in hospitals are charging looks like oh here's even more today\nThan they were before expansion so as we know the idea that the cost for the uninsured were being passed along to private hairs was made but when we take a look back to see what actually happened after Medicaid expansion it it looks like\nAll the patients are paying more the total targets for all payment groups both public and private increased but Medicaid charges in Arizona emergency departments alone increase more than three hundred percent\nThey basically tripled the emergency apartment charges for Medicaid patients\nYou mentioned the goal of having as many people having healthcare as possible which is of course one of the arguments that supporters of Medicaid expansion made to do this program so I'm Wondering if this in your mind is not the way to do it what does a better way to get\nAs many people especially low income residents of Arizona some kind of health care coverage\nAbsolutely so I think there are a lot of really good proposals that are being done some states for example there are funds through ha charges that do allow in in some states for states to use some of those monies\nTo set up ensured insurance risk pool so that people who are more expensive to cover can't actually purchased from the insurance just pulled you can also provide subsidies for individuals transitioning who you know especially for that expansion population people who are working to provide subsidies for them as\n... story comes from the health and science show the pulse

Arizona we'll talk about the state law that may be behind it out here and a Mexican immigrant says this might be the most challenging time just between the two countries ever will hear from him\nBut first this hour Saturday's shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue in the recent wave of pipe bomb center critics of President Trump has given more urgency to ongoing conversations about political rhetoric and the political culture in this country\nAnd yesterday Arizona Senator Jeff flake denounced a U.S funded international Spanish language broadcast program was use anti Semitic language about philanthropist George Soros the senator called for an investigation into how the program was produced and aired and Senator Flake joined us now to talk about all this senator good morning\nHe lauded as\nWell thanks for being here so tell us about your objections to this ah to the broadcast first off and how was it brought to your attention [noise]\nWell are they following a radio and TV largely programs that we have for the past twenty five years in order to try to bring democracy to Cuba the problem is the content is just so bad and\nA TV marching for example you said about twenty five million dollars a year\nTo this or to the broadcast first off and how is it brought to your attention\nWell I've been following the radio and TV march ... programs that we've had for the past twenty five years in order to try to bring democracy to Cuba and the problem is the content that is just so bad and or a TV Marty for example we spend about twenty five million dollars a year\nTo broadcast the signal that doesn't even reach Cuba never has never will it's just a jobs program in Miami so that it's bad enough just a waste of money but then to learn as I did just a few weeks ago from a friend of mine who monitors that stuff\nIs that the TV TV Marty broadcast piece that they produced about George Soros that are that they didn't let into that a calling him a multimillionaire\nJew and a claim that he was responsible for the two thousand eight or a financial meltdown and just just a horribly anti Semitic peace and this is funded by the taxpayers and broadcast a supposedly the cute but doesn't reach there but it reaches elsewhere in Latin America\nAnd so we've asked current investigation anti Semitism is bad enough in this country without the U.S government funded\nHave you gotten any indication as to how exactly this happened like how that was produced and how it made it to air\nKnow the new director of the uh a broadcasting the arm of from government broadcast programs\nOr was put in after that show aired he later but very later uphold it off the digital platform and said that it uh it failed to have balance\nThere is no balance that to that works when you put up a an anti Semitic\nIrma of for government broadcast programs or was put in after that show aired he later but very later uphold it off the digital platform and then said that it uh it failed to have balance\nThere is no balance that that works when you put up a an anti Semitic\nIt can be argued certainly that institutionally Semitism has been reduced tremendously but there are some of the wonder about this particular campaign season where we see George Soros who feel may not like his politics but it was a Holocaust survivor there thinly veiled things when it comes to him is that a bad message to it\nIs distasteful to absolutely wrong it shouldn't be done and you you don't want to awaken those demons any further I think if we learned anything from Nazi Germany and the Holocaust that is that one of the most advanced people's on earth we're capable of slaughtering hall of Europe\nBut it was a Holocaust survivor there thinly veiled things when it comes to him is that a bad message

that\nOne of the most advanced people on earth we're capable of slaughtering hall of European jewelry okay I mean that the the the the Germans were advanced in every way an economics in the arts you know the culturally advanced in so many ways they had the ... the probably the greatest arming at that time\nAnd here they were you know with these these hatred of people and blaming you know one virtually one percent of their population for everything that had gone wrong human beings are capable of doing terrible deeds and we need to remember that\nWell and so what a tragedy like this what happened to Pittsburgh actually people came together and that's always a nice thing to see is that last thing is that the kind of thing where we're or because we've had so many hate related tragedies of late or gun related tragedies or these things that we just move on to the next one\nYou know what the the Jewish people are the most persecuted people in history going back millennia\nAnd one of the things that we can learn from them as their endurance I mean they they have endured and one of the reasons is is the way they look at the future\nThey see the future as something that they can own and they can shape and they can make better and left us all up and we need to remember that when things look really discouraging that we go and sees the future and make it better\n... is editorial

look at some of the top international stories in the coming days is the BBC's rich precedent and rich let's start with Iran where more sanctions against that country or coming soon what can we expect\nFrom them a yeah that's right mock a renewed round of us sanctions against Iran coming into force this weekend targeting the country's financial in oil institutions they said well of course after the U.S pulled back to the Iran nuclear deal earlier\nWe look at some of the top international stories in the coming days is the BBC's rich Preston and rich let's start with Iran where more sanctions against that country or coming soon\nWhat can we expect from them a yeah that's right mark a renewed Randy us sanctions against Iran coming into force\nThis weekend targeting the country's financial in oil institutions they said well of course after the U.S pulled back to the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year\nThis is the second trunk of sanctions that are being re imposed those first ones that took effect in August they were against Iran's automotive sector as well as trading goals\nAnd other valuable metals these revive sanction some of them which actually predates the nuclear deal are expected to pack much more of a punch hits in Iran where it hurts oil exports and the central bank\nSo rich these sanctions are of course designed to hit Iran's economy and their brought by the U.S who else will be happy about it though\nRight around is going to be hit hard by these sanctions ... stands to benefit in a big way back in June they promised to increase their oil production to coincide with the sanctions coming into effect basically plugging the gap left by the loss of Iranian oil\nOn the global markets in helping stabilize prices\nAre economics correspondent Andrew Walker says Iran is already losing I've even before the sanctions have come into effect\nYou know anticipation of the sanctions exploits them production has declined\nGain is from this well ... countries such as India and China if they do decide to continue buying Iranian oil if Iran is no longer able to set it somewhere else then the likes of India and China might be able to get into it cheap at the other potential gain a is Saudi Arabia\nThey have already indicated that they are willing to make up any shortfall as a result of the sanctions the one cloud over that his the

result of the sanctions the one cloud over that his the geopolitical tensions we've had over the old flu events with the murder of ... but at the moment into seemed to be the case that Saudi Arabia can be expected to provide the additional oil wells needs\nSo mocking opportunity there for Saudi Arabia to make some more cash saved the day and distract from other topics that would rather get away from yeah interesting for them so rich let's move next to Cuba and there's an important trip coming up this week for the Cuban President right\nYes that's right the first international tool bye Miguel Diaz canal who took over from Raul Castro in April he's had a few foreign trips already he was at the un in New York last month that this is the first slate of official visit\nThey stopped on Thursday in the country's he's chosen to go to some of those you might traditionally associate with Cuba's communist identity so he's going to Russia then on to China\nNorth Korea Vietnam and lives\nSo what should we make of his itinerary that\nWell it's really a whistle stop tour of Cuba's top friends and allies and the timing and circumstance can't really be more meaningful within you facing charges notably someone within the last name Castro leading the country for the first time in many years\nThis is an opportunity to reform relationships with some of Cuba's closest partners around the world\nAnd there's some key context of this as well Cuba struggling to deal with the impact of the crisis in Venezuela its main regional ally and it's been left some isolated by new governments in Ecuador Brazil and Argentina\nTo top it off relations with us aren't that great\nThis is an opportunity to reform relationships with some of Cuba's closest partners around the world\nAnd there's some key context of this as well Cuba struggling to deal with the impact of the crisis in Venezuela its main regional ally and it's been left some isolated by new governments in Ecuador Brazil and Argentina\nTo top it off relations with us aren't that great we saw thaw in relations under President Obama that President Trump has made it clear he thinks that was a mistake and he's taken a somewhat tougher stunts or trade and travel restrictions reinstated and the White House recently said it planned\nTo put more pressure on Cuba's ministry and intelligence services\nThe among Lima is from our Latin American service BBC ... do\nIn these circumstances the visit to Russia China North Korea Vietnam Laos shows not only that Cuban bridges and roads or move to renew ties with former

seems to be very much we have friends elsewhere ...\nOr rich finally this morning time is of the essence in Europe this week uh obviously time is always on the essence but what do you mean\nWell fortunately it's not about Brexit tougher on or off the European Union is discussing daylight savings time off the moment the EU Monday through member states follow the same practice and put their clothes forwards or backwards on the same date in fact that's just happened here this weekend\nBut for some countries this might be the last\nMinisters from various countries meeting in Austria today to discuss bringing the whole thing to an end a softer a survey earlier this year which find eighty percent of people across the European Union were opposed\nYou Monday through member states follow the same practice and put their clothes forwards or backwards on the same page in fact that's just happened here this weekend but for some countries this might be the last\nMinisters from various countries meeting in Austria today to discuss bringing the whole thing to an end\nA softer survey earlier this year which find eighty percent of people across the European Union\nWere opposed to changing the cooks every six months next depending on higher the conversations go this could mean individual European states deciding to stop the practice completing many each country choosing which time of the year they'll stay on all year round\nSo one of the discussion points clearly will be hard to manage different groups of EU member states\nDoing things differently and how to fix trade relations financial transactions\nAnd so on some are worried that a patchwork of practices could be confusing and hard to manage hey that something you know ... you guys are the reassuring examples and there's nothing to worry about or perhaps the proof\nThat it could all go badly wrong well\nCertainly a lot to keep your eyes on the clock to her over in Europe coming up that the BBC's rich breast and rich is always good to talk to you thank you ...\n[noise]\n... good morning to you and learn younger along with mark ... and\nThe takeaways ... and let's go to Brazil now in a decisive

learning language and isolation from content you're not learning um academic language\nAnd so now the achievement gap gets even bigger because of the demands of teachers uh you know it it's incredibly complex the the students that they serve the diversity of orders in their classroom\nThat's for a language learner who may be at a you know emerge pre emerging emergent level we're talking about very limited English proficiency and it almost becomes a sink or swim type of a situation\nUltimately I think that it is detrimental to our English language learners that we've set up a model that is not putting students' success full lord\nOkay so if the if that's where we are and those are the challenges that we face at this point are there any programs looking forward that might address is things that might help us improve our standards here\nUh so there's the emergence of dealing with immersion across the country and within our state as well more than forty local education agencies now have the language emerging programs however English language learners typically do not have access to those programs because our policy uh\nDoesn't allow them to be in that program so effective programs

they're long term instructions in the first and the second language there socio cultural support their interactive cognitive challenging discovery and learning and their students are integrated with

would be able to work on a model that was more appropriate for the learners are based on their schools needs\nTo reduce that for our block of time and then that one would have would provide students access to the language immersion programs earlier and so there certainly are opportunities to fill the programs that are based on research has effective programming\nRight Megan ...

Mexico who have come to the U.S some of them have been here for decades said they feel less comfortable these days and have been targeted for negativity of times\nAnd even some states like Arizona work to maintain good relations with Mexico there is more doubt when it comes to the federal government's efforts to get along with our southern neighbor for the court trial to his personal experience on both sides of the border and as an immigrant himself he writes about that in his book homelands it was with me to talk about\nA friend who is this the most challenging time you've seen but\nBeen here for decades say they feel less comfortable these days and have been targeted for negativity at times and even some states like Arizona work to maintain good relations with Mexico there is more doubt when it comes to the federal government's efforts to get along with our southern neighbor uh for the court channel has personal experience on both sides of the border and as an immigrant himself\nHe writes about that in his book homelands and as with me to talk about an\nEffort is this the most challenging time you've seen between the U.S and Mexico especially when it comes to immigration\nIn my time it is I mean I Can't think of another time when you felt that you were a a target in every damn you wake up as an immigrant or and you don't know where where you stand you know where where you know is this the country that are that your parents raved about in my case I mean I didn't\nI I never saw myself a leaving for the United states I mean I had to like the idea like little life and in Mexico so sometimes I think you know this is not the country my parents talked about this is not the country I grew up in\nAnd and the country that walk on me and embrace me in and help or achieve success um you know it it for many of us it it it was the American dream and and it continues to be\nBut uh uh I tell you that the the the rhetoric that division that uh come for me to the uh the president's\nBase or from Washington does give you pause and does question you know a what a large share of value survive in the long run\nDoes this indicate to you that there was more hidden racism out there than than we've seen before a has President Trump and other sort of empowered people to speak out in ways that are very very uncomfortable and for many extremely racist\nThe border is not geography the border is a mindset and I think what we're seeing now is fear of the unknown but it's something that immigrants are I I think I've long unfortunately have been used to you

used to you know they either love you\nOr they or they don't uh you've have you know a period where they embrace you and they you know they actually at one point through parties when rush settles guest workers will will come into the to the United states\nAnd people would or will come out and say all the Mexicans are here the Mexicans are here you know things are going to get better uh there's so many of our men\nAre fighting in World War two or in Korea cetera\nAnd then that's followed by periods of massive deeper deportation and it seems that feels like a you know we're in that period again at a time when I traveled the country and\nAnd I hear people from whether it's the Midwest or or Texas or or Phoenix or\nYou know San Diego where people are questioning where the Mexicans why aren't they come in any more and Mexican migration is a historic low\nUh so I think there are some some businesses are in this country from people in this country who are beginning to miss the Mexicans you mean from economic standpoint of cultural standpoint all the above\nI think from both uh I I really do I mean in in in homeland I talk about wanting to be long you know trying to find that the key to belong in in in one country and the other you know the United states and Mexico and and trying to\nFind the mainstream trying to be part of the mainstream of of the United states and it comes at a time when so many businesses are Americans in general I mean they they they love Mexican food they love your music they love your your costs\nWanting to be long you know trying to find

it comes at a time when so many\nBusinesses are Americans in general I mean they they they love Mexican food they love your music they love your your culture they love your food they love your drink I mean they ... misguided instead of as a ... et cetera but you also kind of question why don't they really liked me\nWell what's your comfort level personally as you hear the rhetoric as you report on it as you're in the midst of it are you able to look for the more optimistic side of things do you see yourself in some ways of someone who could help people see perspective from a couple of size but you're not sure if either side or both ... both sides want to listen to the same time\nI think it's an immigrant I'm I'm always looking for the optimistic side a as a journalist sometimes I feel like you know\nThat that my goal is to be a bridge of understanding between two countries and at times I Do feel like it's a it's a broken bridge I mean because of the division of ... you know even at the polarization and in within the media\nAre so it it makes me try harder and try to really\nYou know go after reasons from all kinds of backgrounds to try to explain\nA as a the situation and on a personal level Steve I I um I mean I've been covering the drug war for years in Mexico it's kind of interesting to now be living in the United states and you know your caller an enemy of the people in in ... I'm I feel like I'm part of the best noble\nProfession you know journalism\nOr but at times I got to tell you I I I Will walk in Mexico city\nAnd I will feel a little more hopeful there in spite of all the violence in spite of all the death\nOr that that uh Mexico\nLiving in the United states and you know your call an enemy of the people in in ...
