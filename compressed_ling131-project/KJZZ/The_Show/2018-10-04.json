the gig economy\nBut first this hour a trial is underway in federal court in New York which threatens to expose a dark side of college basketball this stems from an earlier investigation which included former University of Arizona assistant coach Emanuel book Richard said he was charged with fraud and bribery the you of a since fired him\nWith me via Skype to talk about the first few days of the trial is Ricky O'Donnell college basketball editor at SB Nation dot com and Ricky can you remind us first off what are the key issues in this case\nYeah well in the trial the FBI is trying to prove that the university's involved in this scandal were destroyed the assumption being that universities work hard to stay with an overly rules\nAnd were duped by a few individuals who were caught sort of bribing\nPlayers are with money on the recruiting trail the how\nConvinced them to come to their schools\nOr the defense is trying to say that all college basketball is sort of a dirty sport that uh they were doing this only to level the playing field so ah the claim of just rotting was was central to the actual trial it'll be interesting to see how that actually plays out if they can prove that in court\nSo is the defense basically saying maybe we did this stuff but if we did everybody else was doing it too so maybe there needs to be bigger changes or maybe it's not just us\nSays only ... feet is that it's been a central focus of the trial was all ... that were caught trying to bribe players come to schools what the defense is saying is that you know\nThat's basically saying maybe we did this stuff but if we did everybody else is doing it too so maybe there needs to be bigger changes or maybe it's not just us\nExactly says only it beat is that it's been a central focus of the trial was all the details and academics that were caught trying to bribe players come to schools was the defense is saying is that you know\nAll college basketball is dirty and that we had to do this to level the playing field de Jesus people know that the FBI has wiretaps they videos they're not even trying to get themselves off the hook in terms of being in a sense\nWell it sounds like maybe on a larger level college basketball itself is on trial here I mean if if the people who are accused of doing these things aren't denying that they did them but in fact saying everybody's doing it that sounds like it might be a bigger problem\nComparable O W\nA ton of your voice is a program officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and we'll post a link to the city hope dashboard ... dot org [noise]\nYou've probably heard the oft quoted statistic that half of all marriages end in divorce it's a sobering ... used to warn of the difficulties of the institution and the likelihood that if you enter into it unprepared you'll become another statistic but it's not that simple\nI'm sure people will be disappointed to learn that there really isn't one number which is the divorce rate\nPhilip Cohen teaches sociology at the University of Maryland and he conducted a new analysis of US Census data that looks at the current divorce rate in the country and he says there is some research behind that fifty percent divorce rate that you hear about\nIf you take all the people who marry in one year and you follow them forever you can't figure out how many of them end up getting divorced him in in the end every marriage and neither divorce or death sorry to say so we haven't been able to follow some whole cohorts and the baby boomers who are the most divorced from generation ever in history\nThey did approach fifty percent or when you look at them having reached the end of their divorce years\nBut the baby boomers Kansas millennials in ... mark are doing things a little differently staying married Holland's new analysis shows that Americans under the age of forty five or ... driving a sharp drop in the country's divorce rate it's gone down Eighteen percent from two thousand eight to twenty sixteen\nThey did approach fifty percent or when you look at them having reached the end of their divorce years\nBut the baby boomers Kansas millennials ... mark are doing things a little differently staying married Holland's new analysis shows that Americans under the age of forty five or ... driving a sharp drop in the country's divorce rate it's gone down Eighteen percent from two thousand eight to twenty sixteen\nSo what's behind this drop I spoke with Colombia skate more about it and the data he used to come up with these conclusions\nWhat I'm using here is the Census Bureau now has a big survey called the American Community Survey\nThey've been doing since two thousand eight they've asked this question did you get divorced in the last year and it's a big survey with millions of people so it's really good as the first time we've been able to really break divorced down\nUm by age and sex and race and education and everything else on such a large scale and now over almost a decade so what we want to think of as the divorce rate is of everybody who's married how many people get divorced you can do it in a given year\nIt's you know it's about one point seven percent you can do it over the lifetime of a marriage that the projection that the gas\nOkay so you looked at the state of this Community Survey on and you were able to find that even though the marriage rate like the number of people who get married has also gone down those who are getting married today have a greater chance of staying married than they did ten years ago so talk a little bit about what might be behind that change and a little bit more about what you found here\nWell I Can't look inside people's relationships and know what really caused the divorces but because of the big demographic survey we can break it down by some key variables and so the divorce rate declined about Eighteen percent from to those major two dozen sixteen\nThat is the chance of a given divorce ending a and when we look at it more carefully we can see that's driven entirely by people under age forty five so the divorce rate fell for people under it\nPeople's relationships and know what really caused the divorces but because of the big demographic survey we can break it down by some key variables and so the divorce rate declined about Eighteen percent from two thousand eight to two dozen sixteen\nThat is the chance of a given divorce ending a and when we look at it more carefully we can see that's driven entirely by people under age forty five so the divorce rate fell for people under age forty five and did not fall for older people and then uh we also see that it's related to people getting married at older ages\nAnd people getting married with higher levels of education and those are probably um the main contributors to the decline to divorce rate\nRight so there's this this important demographic divide here it sounds like\nYes and and a marriage in a way it's becoming a more elite institution where\nAre increasingly it's people who have college degrees getting married and marrying each other and those marriages are less likely to end in divorce than marriages used to be which is great for them but doesn't really tell us that relationships overall in society are becoming more stable or long lasting\nYeah so okay it's on the other side of that that are lower ... says you know economic status people it's last education are they on getting divorced or they just not getting married and all\nBoth you know people without college degrees the main divide is between people with college degrees and people without college degrees\nAnd people without college degrees are getting married less than they used to\nUm uh but their relationships are also less stable even if they don't get married and those are mostly cohabiting relationships um and uh uh including relationships with children and so ... ... what we see is that people are not postponing marriage because they don't want to get married or don't sort of respect the institution\nThey're not getting married because they don't feel ready because we tend to define marriage\nAs an achievement is something you do when you have guns\nAlso less stable even if they don't get married and those are mostly cohabiting relationships um and uh uh including relationships with children and so ... what we see is that people are not postponing marriage because they don't want to get married or don't sort of respect the institution\nThey're not getting married because they don't feel ready because we tend to define marriage\nAs an achievement is something you do when you have gone to some level of status instability\nUm and a lot of people with a job instability lower incomes\nHousing instability a lot of debt and so on they don't feel ready and so they don't get married and in fact the relationships are not that stable partly because of all those are all all all those problems that they have or that they're likely to encounter and so the relationships are more likely to end\nWhen you look at these generational shift that are happening including the inequities in ... and how it plays out preach demographic when you think this says about the future and the institution of marriage in the country\nWell I think it's increasingly becoming kind of a cornerstone of our system of inequality um uh it's a marriage is becoming something that um that have to have more than the have nots and\nWhen that happens habit it lasts longer so that's not correct thing is but I just think\nWhat we're gonna see increasingly is marriage is for people who have already arrived to have already achieved some status instability and they're going to be divorcing less and so marriage is becoming a key sources of advantage and and I are increasingly unequal society [noise]\nThe reason I think this is going to continue is because if you look at just the people who are getting married now um you see the trends very strongly there the the the gap between college and non college people is increasing the age of marriage is increasing and uh with what we're seeing with divorce rates have just\nBecoming a key sources of advantage and and that are increasingly unequal society [noise]\nThe reason I think this is going to continue is because if you look at just the people who are getting married now um you see the trends very strongly there the the the gap between\nCollege in non college people is increasing the age of marriage is increasing and uh with what we're seeing with divorce rates that just really looks like we're heading into a future where there's a one group of people with high marriage in low divorce and\nA larger group of people with a low marriage rates are

learn more about the bigger picture related to women of color at stem I spoke with Kimberly Scott she's a professor at ASU and executive director of the University's Center for gender equity in science and technology are sort of our conversation by asking you about what progress she's seen over the past decade or so that she believes us out of true impact\nEncouraged that more stem industries particularly tech companies are paying greater attention to their numbers and what I mean by that is specifically generating reports on how many women women of color are in specific rules however what\nWe see is very little movement over the past ten years according to those reports I'm\nReally impressed that Google has continued to release their diversity report and they do so with a critical eye and that they do admit that the needle has not moved that much for women we see a greater uptake\nBut for women of color not so much so\nWe also see in um some of these reports by other industries and most particularly in tech industries in Silicon valley that there needs to be greater challenge to what we mean\nAs it relates to underrepresented women so specifically a Asian American

to what we mean\nAs it relates to underrepresented women so specifically a Asian American women are underrepresented in leadership positions in tech companies which opposes the idea of Asian Americans in general and particularly Asian American women\nDoing incredibly well\nSo if we were to consider what companies are doing\nIs it all of the above and of course I'm going to ask you said because many companies are not looking out for enough diversity is the fact that they're coming to the party is it the fact that there aren't enough people who have been educated or the courage to go in those fields for them to have enough people to choose from\nI think that the answer to your question is incredibly complex one in\nThe way that I approach and particularly uh my colleagues at the center is through\nA systems response and so it's not only the women or girls of color\nWho considerably lack access to opportunities and resources certainly by no fault of their own that poise them to become what I call technology is more um have the stem competencies to not only\nEnter a field but persistent it\nBut then we have on top of that a K. twelve system where we see very clearly and

American not having the same access to even advanced placement computer science courses or teachers in those schools who don't have continued access to professional development\nSo the answer\nAs far as I'm concerned is really one that thinks about the multiple tension points on the pathway that any person must navigate to be successful but also to continue in science technology engineering and\nSo what are some of those are the steps that need to be taken her need to be at the very least thought about an action needs to be taken so there were not continue with this vicious cycle\nOne thing that I encourage individuals but more importantly organizations to do\nIs to have a collaboration to have dialogue in meaningful ways with other individuals and so when I see as many of these efforts are silo demeaning efforts related to diversity and equity and inclusion\nAnd some of those efforts on their own or ... or getting some results imagine what we could do if all of those efforts came together under one on bravo that would require certainly dialogue\nWhere we sing the bottleneck in particular I Know there are many options but is there something about just in general where

engineering and math\nA career then they're white correlates however\nThey don't necessarily have access to the resources for the networks\nTo maintain that interest so that's one issue so it's critical that these efforts start not at higher ed and really not even in high school but during those ... years I myself have between\n... and I can see how significant\nOpportunities to something

business they leave behind huge reminders of what was drive around the valley and you can see plenty of empty large oftentimes brown buildings that used to house superstores\nPhotographer Jesse research has been doing this in documenting what he's calling the retail apocalypse his project is called the changing landscape of American retail he joins me and Jesse I'm curious what gave you the idea to go shoot empty big box stores\nI think first moving here from the Midwest the sprawl was always something that felt very generic and kind of a a turn off the as some of these stores started to vacate that kind of gave me the sense of nostalgia\nOf places that educated points of my childhood and the kind of started become really beautiful uh photographing them kind of as these modern day ruins if you will to a time that just felt not that long ago [laughter] so that's how it started\nWhat do you see when you look at those buildings\n[noise] you know it's it's strange because it has this kind of post apocalyptic feel right the the visuals indicate that\nBut and the kind of started become really beautiful uh photographing them kind of as these modern day ruins if you will to a time that just felt not that long ago [laughter] so that's how it started and what\nDo you see when you look at those buildings\n[noise] you know it's it's strange because it has this kind of post apocalyptic feel right that the visuals indicates that it was a place of business and\nActivity and energy and when you see it empty it's it's kind of sad but it's also sort of again kind of photographing them as as a monument to the past and kind of shifting culture\nAnd something that could quickly are slowly moving and transitioning away from these centers of community and meeting place and I think that's kind of an extension on what we're seeing even like\nThinking about how we communicate or connect their social just another step into a level of isolationism I guess you know not really having those meeting places not really having as many face to face conversations\nIt's interesting you say that though because I think for a lot of sort of critics of big box retailing they would say that those kinds of places were never really meeting places that like if you really want a meeting place you go to your local coffee shop or your local bookstore as opposed to Barnes and noble or borders or you know your local electronic shop as opposed to Best Buy or something that's interesting that\nYou see those as sort of [noise]\nMaybe last meeting places when some people saw them never really is meeting places to begin with\nA good point I mean it's it ... that was a transition from those mom and pops and you know growing up in the late eighties and the nineties\nThe Wal Marts of the world the best buys the world's kind of caught a lot of those shops out so for me growing up those were our best versions in suburban small town Midwest America and I know that the critics will definitely say that they killed some of that and now that they're being killed by a whole ...\nWell that's a good point I mean it's it ... that was a transition from those mom and pops and you know growing up in the late eighties and the nineties\nThe Wal Marts of the world the best buys the world's kind of caught a lot of those shops out so for me growing up those were our best versions in suburban small town Midwest America\nAnd I know that the critics will definitely say that they killed some of that and now that they're being killed by a whole nother kind of entity enforce with online commerce somewhere mismanaged but\nYou're right though it to me though the spaces I don't even think about this when I'm at the grocery store you know Amazon and Wal Mart or plane in the space where you can have your groceries delivered or just pick up groceries and for someone like my grandmother that's kind of a highlight of er which go into the grocery store two or three times a week\nEverybody knows her name I sometimes think about what when that's taken away what are those spaces where especially in suburbia and it's in a city like Phoenix it's so sprawling what are those places where people are having those interactions not saying they may all go away but it's a possibility\nWell it's interesting because when you look at some of the photos they obviously look emptied are these giant empty building some of which you can still see\nYou know sort of where the sun maybe left the imprint of the name of the stores logo or something on there\nAnd you really like in many cases there's nothing around DC giant parking lot or there's one image I saw viewers of of a street looked like maybe it was an old office park or something with an empty street that you could probably do the cannon down not hit anybody with just these giant hulking buildings and other side of it\nRight and it goes back to what I was saying before and it's just this kind of strange sensory experience one place that would replace that was once busy and full of energy and now that it's again this kind of modern day ruin but\nWithout being really affected by the time and seeing like what people would probably call ruin porn and it's just there and it's like it's noticeable\n[noise] right and it goes back to what I was saying before and it's just this kind of strange sensory experience once place that would replace that was once busy and full of energy and now that it's again this kind of modern day ruin but\nWithout being really affected by the time and seen like what people would probably call ruin porn\nAnd it's just there and it's like it's noticeable of what that space used to be because of the repetitive nature of the architecture say like a Macy's or a best buy like you know what a best buy is when you see it and you're right and then you see this kind of\nSun bleach their son stains and trance like the tags ... like when the tag is gone or like where it's at Macy's or Sears it really kind of drives home this like oh why I just remember being there five ten years ago\nAnd it's now extinct\nWell I Wonder what you've seen as far as you know you have obviously all these images of these empty big box stores and as we've seen sort of the local is movement grow when people are maybe becoming a little more conscious about where their food comes from and you know buying things from local mom and pop stores like we used to you know way back when\nI'm Wondering if you think that we're sort of maybe going back to that time when these big box stores will sort of be\nI don't know maybe like a blip in history or something to when we went away from that and now in many cases people are going back to that\nNo it's true and I I think like what you're seeing too and some of the real purpose of the space is is that they're transitioning them from\nYour normal kind of regional or like neighborhood mall into this kind of experiential space so it's like there's entertainment retail is kind of a [noise]\nA supporting cast member enroll whereas they used to be the star of the show but now you're seeing these these buildings being repurposed where there's you know\nOf the space is is that they're transitioning them from your normal kind of regional or like neighborhood mall into this kind of experiential space so it's like there's entertainment retail is kind of a\nA supporting cast member and roll whereas they used to be the start of the show but now you're seeing these these buildings being repurposed where there's you know more open air there's more entertainment and I think that also probably talks to\nGenerationally how younger people are buying less things and they're more invested in experiences\nDo you think that this kind of project would be possible and if so would look the same in another city as as what you found here\nI think so I I mean I've seen similar things like in New Jersey and Ohio Missouri\nBut I think what works here in Phoenix is that there is kind of this stark miss a lot of the architecture and the suburbia and the un and the western sprawl and the color that really kind of\nHelped create the ... the aesthetic of of the portfolio in the project\nThat feels almost paint surely or illustrative so that's what I've been really kind of looking at here in Phoenix that I think helps that you know the graphic lines the color and the desert light to give it that very graphic yet celebrates we're kind of take away for the for the viewer\nAll right that's photographer Jesse researcher we've been talking about his project the changing landscape of American retail Jesse thanks for coming in thank you for having me a son\n[noise]\nYear advertisers spending more money on digital advertising in TV spots and social media influence there is on YouTube and Instagram are they part of that these days influences can make\nWe've been talking about his project the changing landscape of American retail just you've been to Africa imminent you for having me on\nAnd [noise]\nLast year advertisers spend more money on digital advertising then TV spots and social media influences on YouTube and Instagram are they part of that\nThese days influences can make big bucks for a single post and they can be just as important to a company's brand as traditional advertising but influence or have lost the trust of many advertisers and consumers lately by things like violent buying followers are failing to follow federal disclosure requirements about advertising according to the Atlantic\nSo some companies like Macy's are turning to their own employees to be there on line brand ambassador is that company has created a team of employees to be part of its style crew [noise]\nHey it's still reeling from the style crew in today I'm going to talk to you about one of my favorite fall trend which is false world or a lottery pieces show you get started in the first ones from sushi and it's a really great wrapped tops and I love for follow\nWill this social media approach work in attracting younger and online consumers for more on that I got a hold of Katherine Duncan a lecture and management at the ... business school of Washington University of St Louis\nWell one of the things that you find that with the comedy like Macy's and their style crew\nIs that it gives a company like mates is a chance to use real people and presumably if you're using your employees they share your values they share your brand and they shop at your store for example for me six so it gives you a chance to showcase real people who customers can identify with\nRight so even though their employees does this come across as more authentic more reliable\nI think probably it does come across as more reliable if you didn't think about when you go to a Macy's and you see someone who's selling something you would expect they would be\nYour employees they share your values they share your brand and they shop at your store for example from eight six so it gives you a chance to showcase real people who customers can identify with\nRice so even though their employees does this come across as more authentic more reliable\nI think probably it does come across as more reliable if they didn't think about when you go to a Macy's and you see someone who's selling something you would expect that they would be wearing Macy's products\nSo starting with the actual experience in the store and now taking an unjust social media it gives you a chance for people who look like you who act like you who think like you and if you find one of these ambassadors\nWho actually represents the kinds of clothes that you might be understood the beauty products whatever it is that they're featuring you would start following them and you'd be interested to see what they're doing\nAnd a forward his nomination to the the entire um Senate and he was confirmed within hours you know done and done Earl Warren\nAnd a forward his nomination to the the entire um Senate and he was confirmed within hours you know\nDone and done Earl Warren right I'm a former Republican governor but in the last um you know the last thirty or so years ah candidates have been drawn from the judiciary but very specifically people who have a Republican or a democratic pedigree those who clerked for a certain justice\nOr those who are active in party politics\nIt's probably not going to surprise anyone that a judge Kavanaugh clerked for Anthony Kennedy does\nThe partisanship we see in terms of the nomination process does that affect the partisanship we see on the court in terms of how they rule and whether they're able to convince each other because we've heard that certain justice has been kind of a swing and say well go along with you on this ... almost like a political compromise\nThat's an interesting question because the culture of the court has been one of cooperation\nEven famously bipartisan cooperation that doesn't necessarily lead to one justice convincing another of her opinion or but it does or there's been a kind of an extraordinary\nCamaraderie on the court and whether that's eroded in recent years is is up for debate um but one of the things that's interesting about the the Supreme Court and why it's so uh immensely important now\nIs that the Supreme Court has become an arbiter of of legal questions that Congress has not been able to deal with because of the the partisanship and because of the inability of Congress to actually pass legislation in things like campaign finance it's become a matter for the courts\nAnd so it's no accident that Supreme Court picks are so politically important because\nHi I'm Phil Latzman and thanks for listening to K. Jay's easiest audio service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in nonprofit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all of their accounting needs find out more at your part time controller dot com\nAccident that Supreme Court picks are so politically important because in the absence of national legislation um you get the courts deciding what his constitutional what is not constitutional\nSo based on what you've seen from historical standpoint does this look like we're heading into one of the more hyper partisan periods of at least the nominations and of course some people are worried that that will send us down a slope will never return from it if we can be that pessimistic but do you think\nWill hold for a while uh yes it will hold for this for ... future um there there is some precedent in the nineteenth century for some extreme partisanship one of the uh the most famous examples as that of Roger ...\nHe was Andrew Jackson's treasury secretary nominee Jackson put tiny up for the Segre secretary the treasury of the Senate refused to endorse that refused to confirm him so Jackson waited for the next election to yield a Democratic majority\nAnd then put them up for the Supreme Court and then just to be sure put them up for chief justice of the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd he's most famous for the decision in Dred Scott the Sanford and Eighteen fifty seven which held that African Americans had no rights which the white men was bound to respecting quotes and that the negro might just be unlawfully be reduced to slavery for his own benefit unquote\nAnd so this decision ruled that Congress had no power to regulate slavery in the U.S territories and it tried to settle a thorny issue that ah that Congress couldn't settle and that the that was tearing the country apart Kevin ... is a ...\nAmericans had no rights which the white men was bound to respecting quotes and that the negro might just be unlawfully be reduced to slavery for his own benefits unquote\nAnd so this decision ruled that Congress had no power to regulate slavery and the U.S territories and it tried to settle a thorny issue that the Congress couldn't subtle and the the there was tearing the country apart\nKevin ... is a history professor at ASU [noise]\n\n\nEvery year thousands of Catholics make their way to a small town in Sonora Mexico to honor or revered saint many come on foot as part of their sacrifice of the same age but ongoing highway construction between the gallows and not dilemma has made the dirty more dangerous for some this year\nFrom ... from terrorist asking ...
