first earlier this week on the show we spoke with egg know fill up with the Arizona Republic about a piece he'd written about particular tax incentives used by cities around the state\nWill focus on ... those are government property lease excise tax agreements there are important and effectiveness had been questioned by some had to respond to the conversation with Philip we invited Chris Christie and ... and she has community and economic development director for the city of Phoenix\nChris for why do you believe that triplets makes sense when it comes to Phoenix economic development\nIt allows us to create the urban environment that we want today\nWhen you're looking at density when you're looking at attraction of some of the signature and iconic buildings that create your skyline their projects that just don't work today financially so if you look at building a project in suburban market you might pay a hundred a hundred and twenty five dollars a square foot you've got Eighteen acres to work and the project works really well\nWhen you're looking at an urban market like downtown Phoenix um it\nWhen you're looking at density when you're looking at attraction of some of these signature and iconic buildings that create your skyline their projects that just don't work today financially so if you look at building a project in the suburban market you might pay a hundred a hundred and twenty five dollars a square foot you've got Eighteen acres to work and the project works really well\nWhen you're looking at an urban market like downtown Phoenix um it first of all it was somebody else's downtown before so you put a teaspoon in the ground and you're going to hit something you didn't expect to hit but to get the urban density that's called for in our general plan you're looking at three to four hundred dollars a square foot\nSo you're at twenty five thousand dollars is stalled restructured parking\nThe projects that in this market just don't work today to get that dense urban development and the density of people you want in an urban market\nWas uh what do you think is important for us to understand that when it comes to offering reasons that as we can sort of can have a pejorative search due to some people would use it possible to do the kind of development through the city of Phoenix to the size of Phoenix would like to make without having some form of this\nTo bring a business into town and then then business stays for as long as the incentives last and they move on to another town that'll give them new incentives that's not the way we develop the way we develop the Knicks as as a leader is it's kind of like in your neighborhood we have the biggest house on the block\nAnd we do better if all the other houses in the neighborhood look nice but we have some fundamental issues with balancing our our city checkbook and building up our infrastructure spending enough money on streets and transportation to make this organically the best place for people to come to be that that leading example of how\nOur city can tackle tough problems like pensions like water like streets like public safety and be an example for our neighbors around the valley so it's it's kind of healthy cooperation but also a little bit of a competition I think the mayor does have to be a cheerleader for what's obviously the best city in the state\nUm

Bush and Barack Obama had in common was that they tried mostly unsuccessfully to reach out to the other side and make some peace and build a broader coalition\nDonald Trump is not even tried to do that he's been you know vigorous and clear in his dissent interest in doing that and that makes it easier to build an oppositional movement another thing that's happened is the growth of social media has made it easier to turn out lots of people really quickly\nIn olden times would say the march on Washington in Nineteen sixty three it will take months and months or years of organizing to be able to generate\nHundreds of thousands of people in the Washington Mall the question that we are going to see in the next election is whether or not sustaining organizations have done necessarily work of getting people out to the polls\nSustaining that energy to get them registered an out to vote\nWas let's say the march on Washington in Nineteen sixty three it will take months and months or years of organizing to be able to generate hundreds of thousands of people in the Washington Mall the question that we are going to see in the next election is whether or not sustaining organizations have done necessarily work of getting people out to the polls\nSustaining that energy to get them registered an out to vote and then continuing to make an impact even with out an election looming that's the challenge\nYeah and it's a different story when we tell the history of movements of the past we like to focus on the dramatic demonstration\nIt distorts the more complicated and more time consuming and maybe more boring reality\nThat movements are built of people sitting in church basements and in around kitchen tables and having arguments about what to do and what issues are next and all that stuff has to happen first sustained influence\nBut when you tell the story of the civil rights movement you say oh one day Rosa Parks got tired of sitting in the back of the bus so she protested and boom a movement takes place\nSeems to me now that the whole goal of the protest seems to be not to change the mind of the party in power but to change the party in power\nThink the fact that each party the Democrats than Republicans have has become much less politically diverse changes the landscape from Nineteen sixty three there were plenty of Republicans who supported civil rights in Nineteen sixty three\nThere were plenty of Democrats who didn't so the polarization does matter but it's a mistake to um put a glossy vision in which a non violent action is just aimed at convincing people and protest isn't controversial that's not the way the past was I was going out\nThree there were plenty of Republicans who supported civil rights in Nineteen sixty three\nThere were plenty of Democrats who didn't so the polarization does matter but it's a mistake to um put a glossy vision in which\nA non violent action is just aimed at convincing people and protesters and controversial that's not the way the past was\nI was going out on public opinion polls the other day and I discovered that the march on Washington was extremely unpopular\nAbout three quarters of Americans thought it was dangerous destructive and probably counterproductive or at least that's what they told pollsters and when we look back in history\nWe've read defined that event to something consensual we've made Martin Luther king and the people who were at that march into you know your your distant uncle who's very friendly and safe\nAnd that's not the way social change takes place by making Martin Luther king and the civil rights movement into this consensual easy process historically then we lose the sense of perspective on what's going on now\nI Want to raise the issue of social media it's not simply that social media is used as a tool to organize people outside of their homes\nWhen the fields were in full bloom there were years when next daughter Kathy was barely taller than the flower stocks now she's a professor with kids around here she is at the flower shop speaking with her father about their memories\nThat you do you remember when you first started farming flowers here\nOh it was after the war we were put in\nA the ... in a after the war started\nSo that was right after the war and then how many families along there were\nOnly two of us were farming showers and I were a rowing SARS at a time when a a two or three other families came in and started going for so at one time there was\nProbably three hundred acres of large along the line and the perfume you could smell for two three miles away and it was a\nA national uh an attraction\nTo all of truth there buddy would come here and baseline was just a two lane highway and they had to have a police up there on the corner or directing traffic so it wouldn't be jammed up thousands of cars come through here and it was uh\n... and it was a\nNational an attraction all of ... and everybody would come here and we learned was just to to learn our way and they had to of a police up\nThere on the corner a direct driver so it wouldn't be jammed up some of the cars come through here and it was a really good business for\nAlthough it was a little strange having all the tourists come in all the time we were kids and they would sometimes want to take pictures right of us in the field because they were little kids\nOr even hard to tell or bill to the people grow up and to the top of the ... and look down on the views and\nI remember um just business as being\nA lot of work for you and mom so I remember being here like on the weekends when you would have maybe six weddings that you'd have to get out and all of those boxes were lined up and we would be all blowing into the bad side just sad and everything boxed up seed to deliver them\nThinking about a no says I don't know how I Am married to everything like that\nIt was a big business yeah I remember you you and I'm sitting there are you sitting there at a particularly writing out and the mom taking care of the front and she was so good with all the customers she would always make that joke about um I won't charge you tax don't tell the governor [laughter]\nWorld War I miss a farming area I Love barring that's why I was\nIn for me to grow plants and more to rule and a producer or something that people in the joy or really enjoyed it\nShe would always make that joke about um I won't charge you tax don't tell the governor [laughter]\nWell I missed a farming area I Love barring that's why I was in for me to grow plants and watch them grow and\nA producer or something that people in the joy or really enjoyed the\nDid you kind of expect that one of us to go into the business because we all moved away none of us really intend\nTo law didn't\nExpect to my children to take over the business because uh it\nWas a lot of hard work but I put a lot of hours and work\nAnd to building up the business and buying up land and everything and there was times when a and a growing season would leave early in the morning and never go back to lead an art or wouldn't see the\nKids for maybe a couple of weeks at a time and all there were sleep when I go home and I left before they go up so\nBut it was a great place to place so I remember running around in that area and then all of that plane around here it was sad to sell the land but because none of the kids were going into it\nIt was something that made sense because that was sort of the what the plan was for retirement was selling the land at some point\nI guess I'm happy that you have the flower shop to be at 'cause you're Ninety five and a kind of keeps you young I think [laughter]\nWe'll hear coming out a mixture [laughter]\n\nThat was caffeine not the guy was

president and CEO of high ground and Sam Richard of Korea so partners that's just go back to President Trump being in the valley and check on me ask you this so\nHe's obviously going to wrap up the Republican base which should be an advantage to Martha McSally but will it turn off those Republican women voters we talked about so much is there that potential to some of the mix Sally ... sort of has to have President Trump here to get the basic sided but is there a real risk there as well\nYeah there's two things that were it's Donald Trump right we're we're not getting anything new here we're getting Donald Trump and he's coming out here and he's going to fire up bass\nHe's also looking at those unaffiliated voters people who are you know dissatisfied with the partisan nature of our politics he arguably is that guy he's arguably that transformative figure because he said you know you just dispatched incumbent Republican senator out you're single hand\nRight we're we're not getting anything new here we're getting Donald Trump and he's coming out here and he's going to fire up bass\nHe's also looking at those ... unaffiliated voters people who are\nYou know dissatisfied with the partisan nature of our politics he arguably is that guy he's arguably that transformative figure because he said you know you just dispatched incumbent Republican senator out here is singlehandedly pretty much or maybe just did that to themselves\nBut you know so but that's that's the he's looking at that motivating that base\nClearly if you're going to have some time after this for a mix salaries campaign to narrate to that part of the audience and I suspect what you're going to hear if this is what I Believe this is what I fought for what are you know about her\nYou know she says I don't you know oh I I'm not really a Democrat I'm not really well what are you a ... and she's going to that's going to be the discussion we're going to have for the next ten days and set the congresswoman cinemas gonna have to have a response on that other than Omar to stop being mean\nSim cards from sending out doing her own activities today it is kind of a counter to let people know what she's working on\nCould this be a real plus for her campaign the fact that President Trump is here\nI mean I think that definitely it it has that that high risk high reward a for for a short for the Republican candidates at the check was\nReferencing and and you know I I think that we've come a long way right I'm ah from the time when a our previous governor wagged her finger or when President Obama came in the tarmac last night no one was there from Arizona State wide elected\nA leadership was not welcome Trump right and that was definitely a finger wag but I think that I I think that's a really important thing that you you you know governor do see has is a sad that he's going to be there at the rally tonight\nBut he's only going to be there you know for just enough to get a face time it's like when you really feel like you have to go to a party but you're just going to go to say Hi to a couple of people and then do an Irish guy\nElected a leadership was not welcome Trump right and that was definitely a finger wag but I think that I I think that's a really important thing that you you you know governor do see has is a sad that he's going to be there at the rally tonight\nBut he's only going to be there you know for just enough to get a face time it's like when you really feel like you have to go to a party but you're just going to go to say Hi to a couple of people and then do an Irish\nI'm going to tell you I mean I I think what that was last night it's nine thirty at night your past the news hour anyways and he really wanted to start the news cycle with his speech at noon today\nAnd have the news cycle began this guy is not a novice at this you guys so if he wanted to do something at the airport we would have done something at the airport so it was about focusing on the narrative that he wanted to set up for Arizona beginning today with to visit a fundraiser the Luke effort and then uh and\nAnd I think my ah my reaction to that is I think that that narrative really has a lot of risk for Republicans and a lot of potential reward for those voters on on the fence right because\nUm you who knows what he's going to say tonight I'm uh at at at that rally just last night at the rally in Montana he praised congressman gene forte for body slamming reporter this is the same week that\nUh you know the gruesome details a reporter and Saudi Arabia were uncovered so I you know this is also you know a person who mocked openly Dr ... Ford after her testimony in Congress\nSo I I think that there's going to be a a lot of potential issues obviously where we're projecting here or in in a couple of hours in the future but\nYou know I think that uh he's just guaranteed to say something that is is going to uh be outrageous\nWell I think that's probably true because the two campaigns are ... are very you know that you have to be the Alexa candidate in a congressman cinema who's like Hi I'm good thank you\nThere's going to be a a lot of potential issues obviously where we're projecting here uh in in a couple of hours in the future but you know I I think that uh he's just guaranteed to say something that is is is going to uh be outrageous\nWell I think that's probably true because the two campaigns are ... are very you know that you have to be\nThe Alexa candidate in a congressman cinema who's like Hi I'm good thank you Ted I only heard a lot of credit or maybe a little bit maybe a little bit since that looked like pretty much what it was and you got unplugged in riffing president that is going to go and so\nThis is a live wire campaign this is why this stuff's fun to talk about it's fun to watch it's fun to and I can guarantee you Democrats in my friend fan will be outraged by something that the president said and there'll be outrage on ... on my right pushing back on that and\nYou know it's it's not up to all of us to navigate our way through this forest of a\nSocial media and all that and say are you what are you really talking about and what do you really going to do and what your record how far down the ballot will the president's visit\nAffection you mentioned governor do she's going to be there we know that a cop Congresswoman Debbie Lesko is going to be there how far down the ballot will his well his visit impact either positive or negative for a particular candidate\nI think at this point it's a little bit hard to tell a partly because there are a lot of other factors happening down the ballot I mean we see that water is a very very big issue\nI'm ah in in Arizona right now and for a handful of counties there's going to be a handful of seats up for that water board a ... race right now so I think that those issues are going to be affecting that obviously the red for ed movement is going to affect a lot of the state legislative races\nUm so I think that the president's visit is going to affect turnout not necessarily A People's beliefs of what they're going to bring into the ballot box when they go into I'd make that decision ...\nMaybe congressional candidate says that may be some of the statewide offices that his\nUp for that water board or ... race right now so I think that those issues are going to be affecting that obviously the red for ed movement is going to affect a lot of the state legislative races\nUm so I think that the president's visit is going to affect turnout not necessarily A People's beliefs of what they're going to bring into the ballot box when they go into to make their decision ...\nMaybe congressional candidate says that may be some of the statewide offices that is not as far as I think so I think that's the word because voters are still I'm Still getting all kinds of calls from my friends and people are like hey what about the school board races and what about uh as I said there's only a pie or have you know right right and you're like OK well here's what you know I talked to\nSixty east valley women in politics the other day if they were\nPost presidential election cycles the party that's an office usually experiences some losses on that camp trickle down to the state level that's why\nPost presidential election cycles the party that's an office usually experiences some losses on that camp trickled down to the state level that's why there's renewed hope in that\nI'll believe it when I see it just because I I've heard this refrain every election cycle and it and it just doesn't happen it's consistently been Seventeen Thirteen the last several years does it seem as though\nDemocrats may be poised even if they don't win control of the Senate to win maybe a seat or some seats in the Senate and and some seats in the house\nThat I think is more realistic I'm expecting perhaps a shrunken divide a little bit maybe we get down to sixteen fourteen\nPerhaps more realistically would be a a Fifteen Fifteen tie which has occurred in the Senate and the past and the house there's just simply more seats that you'd need to pick up and there's a different dynamic given that there are two candidates from each party\nWhile in most districts to candidates from each party running for two seats in the Senate and it's just a little bit more clear cut head to head type of race\nSo in the Senate yeah I I I wouldn't be surprised if there was a a different makeup and what that would do um is create a dynamic where a handful of Republicans would be incredibly powerful lawmakers were talking to folks like representative Heather Carter who's expected to get elected to the Senate\nCurrent senator Kate Brophy McGee who's in one of those swing districts and legislative district twenty eight and parts of northern Phoenix where she's considered that ... am more the moderate word on but in in a situation where there's a sixteen fourteen split\nThat type of Republican is very important\nIncredibly powerful lawmakers we're talking folks like representative Heather Carter who's expected to get elected to the Senate\nCurrent senator Kate Brophy McGee who's in one of those swing districts and legislative district twenty eight and parts of northern Phoenix where she's considered that ... and more the moderate word on but in in a situation where there's a sixteen fourteen split\nThat type of Republican is very important for for both parties because they're the swing vote that can decide what kind of legislation gets through\nI'm interested in ... for a number of reasons but one in particular on the house side\nIn the past Democrats have run one house candidate using what's called the single shot\nA technique where you try to get all your voters to vote for one candidate and right now there is one Democrat and one Republican representing that district this year there are two Democrats running into Republicans running ... how do you see that district shaking out at this point based on maybe pose you've seen or people you talked to\nFrom people I've talked to a there's an expectation that Kate broken me gave the current senator probably still has a good chance of holding on to that seat she's facing a teacher Christine marsh\nWho's been running for well over a year now and as a part of this uh this uprising of teachers who are trying to seek office\nBut a lot of folks especially down at the Capitol view ... as a very strong candidate as someone who actually has some bipartisan bona fides to rely on the house races is also very interesting as you said because there's two Democrats you have the incumbent representative Kelly Butler and then an upstart candidate in the air and Lieberman\nAnd they're almost relying on not just that insurgency of Democrats trying to turn out votes but also the infighting in that district among Republicans we saw a governor Doug Ducey endorse\nKathy pappas pets is who's a first time candidate running for the
