start with what we actually know about the numbers and what it means for the outcome of the mid term\nThe early voters targets that were going to have a high turnout what are we are seeing record numbers of early vote for Trump in in some cases in any election including a predator\nIt had three hours in line and today we'll be examining all things early to\n\nWe start with what we actually

elections project he joined us via Skype I spoke with him and Sasha Eisenberg author of the victory lab about the numbers\nDon't states over two thirds of the votes will be asked origin election day and so if this early vote continues at this pace we should see a very high turnout determine election may be the highest in anyone's memory\nOr there are a couple of states that you're looking at more closely than others in terms of how many people vote early and then what this early vote portends\nWell of course we're tracking the states have competitive races on and on all of them have high volume of early vote so uh there's limited data in some states but there's a lot of data and some other states so we do get a lot of data out of Georgia\nOut of ... out as a Nevada for example and all of those have interesting races and there's lots of things going on\nAcross the country but we get a lot of\nKnow really solid good data\nOut of those three states as we could see from this data right now but at a early voting is running at ... in some cases a record pace for mid term election\nYou know there's one other thing that's related to your posters make a certain assumptions about who they think it's going to be a likely voter on some of these posters are thinking that perhaps the electric going to look like a typical midterm election where we get maybe forty percent of those eligible to vote on I don't think that's going to happen\nRight now but John early voting is running at ... in some cases a record pace for mid term election\nYou know there's one other thing that's related to

election where we get maybe forty percent of those eligible to vote on\nI don't think that's going to happen here I think we're going to have a a turnout rate is higher than that we could be a ... at least admit forty\nPercent range so if we beat the forty eight percent turnout to rehab Nineteen sixty six were and a half a turnout rate that will be the highest that we've seen in the last century and so on if pollsters aren't taking that into account and they're going to miss a and they'll probably underestimate\nOr in some ways uh the contours of the electorate\nEspecially what about you what do you know ... and what is your all your research shown you and that the early vote and what it does or doesn't tell us about the upcoming election and the kinds of people who are showing up\nSo I

reporting on the schools problems high up act for being with us that morning ... give us some of the details regarding disclosure plan what has changed and it has there been more than incremental movement by the school to to make it up to certain actually get to this this area of agreement\nYes essentially what they're doing now is they have about twenty two students who are left and they have to do what's called the ... plan for them which basically is ensuring that they're able to finish their degrees and how they're going to do this is Arizona somebody actually is not offering any\nClasses itself nor does it planned to but they would enroll students at other schools and so for each student\nYes essentially what they're doing now is they have about twenty two students who

not offering any\nClasses itself nor does it a plan to but they would enroll students at other schools and so for each student they have to work out a plan you know some will go to Arizona State university some will go to other schools and essentially then they can\nFinish up there they won't technically be students have these other law schools but they will be able to get their law degrees well\nThis has been a bumpy road we heard about the possibility of a partnership with you before um do you remember what went on with that and why this seems to be a little bit more in play was it was there a bigger agreement that had to be reached for\nA U.S you to be on its own I guess I was I was thinking that that seemed like the the next logical step and now we're hearing about this what what has changed with anything there\nWell I'm originally stomach did want to have a ... plan where essentially all of the students would go to ASU um\nThe concern that ASU had is that some of these students you know would they have been successful at ASU hum and there was a concern there that that some of them may not have been in and maybe another environment might be appropriate for them and so ah also when some it turned in their plan\nTo the NBA for approval issue had not yet signed off on it so you know the idea was gonna prove something unless she was fully on board with it\nSo instead they're doing individual plans so each of the twenty two remaining students will have their own plan a bed and the ab feels that this will actually work better for the students so they'll be able to finish their degrees\nAnd his his teachers anything I don't want to cast aspersions here make too much of a blanket statement does this indicate any problem with generally the way that this law schools run or other private law schools\nWas fully on board with it so instead they're doing individual plans so each of the twenty two remaining students will have their own plan a ... and the ab feels that this will actually work better for the students so they'll be able to finish their degrees\nAnd this is teachers anything I don't want to cast aspersions here make too much of a blanket statement does this indicate any problem with generally the way this law schools run or other private law schools are on do we learn anything from that or is this an individual situation\nWell what happened during the recession is there were fewer students going to law school and law school's began competing more aggressively for students and some of the law schools actually\nLowered their admission standards for students so um what you had then is a couple of years later when the students get ready to take the bar um you know not all of them are passing the bar at the ... the numbers that they used to and\nSo that was a concern with Arizona summit is there was a thought that perhaps they enrolled I'm you know too many students and maybe some students that\nProbably should have had higher academic credentials and and this kind of hurt them in the end\nOver the course of your reporting on this story which has been a long running story every had a chance to talk with certain students and if so what are they talking\nOn this has been very stressful and very frustrating for some students um\nYou know I obviously some of them saw the writing on the wall and in two thousand Seventeen when the school was put on probation by the a BA they just decided to try to transfer out um there are a number of students though that um\nWere admitted to the school and were dismissed for academic reasons and these students probably have the toughest situation because you know they have student loan debt and they don't have a law degree to show for it so you know they're they're faced with having to pay back the is relatively high student loans\nYou know without really the career and the earnings that that would enable you to do that\nAnd finally one of the mission statements with the school\nThat um were admitted to the school and were dismissed for academic reasons and\nThese students probably had the toughest situation because you know they have student loan debt and they don't have a law degree to show for it so you know they're they're faced with having to pay back the is relatively high student loans you know without really the career and the earnings that that would enable you to do that\nAnd finally one of the mission statements at the school or at least outwardly was to create more diversity in the legal profession to somebody like this end up hurting battles ... goal in general\n[noise] you know that kind of remains to be ... Steen they they really did have a high percentage um you know they're they're\nA minority percentage was forty one percent which is the highest in the state\nUm and so and I I Will say I have talked to a number of students especially those who went to the school early on you know when it opened in two thousand for who\nThey really credit Arizona summit with you know enabling them to become attorneys or you know it they had a program that was specifically set up for working adults and those people that couldn't go full time to school and so for those students you know if they did not have Arizona summit they would not have law degrees today\nAnd rhyme and is a senior reporter for the Arizona Republic and thanks for the time today thank you [noise]\nCouple of years ago Ted ...

talk about what school could be and the potential there and some of the experiments some schools and districts are undertaking ideally to get where we should be how big of a shift do we actually need to make\nWell it\nVaries you know there's some schools that are quite far of all they're doing really remarkable things and then there are an awful lot of schools that are doing kind of same old same old where you know students are basically push to memorize material replicate low level procedures and follow instructions and so those schools have some distance to cover\nIn terms of the actual model of how school work I mean you make a reference to like in the book of some schools are basically preparing kids to enter a world that doesn't exist anymore is that model even functional anymore I mean do we need to rethink the way that schools operate\nLike the world's going to change dramatically I mean it already is and the impact of technologies accelerating that so we really can't imagine what the world would be like in ten to Twenty years and to me that has profound ramifications for what we do with two and four kids in school [noise]\nAnd if you understand that they will have to invent and reinvent and reinvent their own ways to contribute to society as adults\nThen the question is how do you set them up to be able to do that during this precious years because school\nOur schools and teachers set up to do that right now\nYou know teachers I'm a big fan of teachers teachers desperately want to do great things for their kids what I'm not a fan of is the testing regimen\nAnd reinvent and reinvent their own ways to contribute to society as adults then the question is how do you set them up to be able to do that during this precious years because school\nOur schools and teachers set up to do that right now\nYou know teachers I'm a big fan of teachers teachers desperately want to do great things for their kids what I'm not a fan of is the testing regimen we insist and impose on our schools and our teachers and\nThose tests you know I understand the intent behind them but I always encourage people to start looking at some of those questions and then say if I get really good at the thing is required to answer these questions\nIs that even remotely relevant later in life and people concluded it's not relevant\nSo in terms of some of the things that schools and districts and teachers are trying that are maybe a little more outside the box than what people are I think of as a as a traditional school environment what strikes you as things that are maybe really have a lot of potential to change things for the better\nWell what gets me excited in schools is when kids have a voice in the problems they take on when the teachers are trusted to engage in spite of their kids which by the way is why they entered the profession and were when they get good at something at school and ask is this useful later in life are answer is yes because all too often the answer is no\nAnd that often takes the form of identifying and carrying forward an initiative with some connection to the real world that's complicated you know that that draws on multiple disciplines maybe has you working with other classmates where you try some things that don't work and then just keep at it until you get something really good but at the end of the day\nWas produced by the student we could evaluate we can look directly at what they've made are created or invented or wrote\nWell it's interesting because in my high school experience and I suspect I'm not alone in this I can distinctly remember ...\nIt it you know that that draws on multiple disciplines maybe has you working with other classmates where you try some things that don't work and then just keep at it until you get something really good but at the end of the day was produced by the student we could evaluate we can look directly at what they've made are created or invented or wrote\nWell it's interesting because in my high school experience and I suspect I'm not alone in this\nI can distinctly remember sitting in class thinking what am I ever going to have to use this in my life learning whatever or whatever it was it sounds like maybe what you're saying is that those concepts aren't the problem is maybe the way they are being presented and the way students are being taught to think about those those concepts\nYeah and a lot of it is we sort of dumb down and push it to a level of some folic abstraction and one example I use my talks is what's the best way to teach a kid about electricity to get them excited about science\nAnd I say if if they shattered a master electrician they would understand so much about the science in the physics of electricity instead we have a memorized poems law you know to what end so what if you can memorize formulas if you don't understand how connects to the real world\nHave you really learn much and I think one of the things we've done in school is to systematically reduced and eliminate any form of hands on any form of applied all to have their pursue more intensely a college ready very academic context that I'm skeptical kids are learning much when they do that\nSo does that suggests you the more of a school maybe needs to be experiential instead of sitting in a classroom the way we traditionally think about school\nMaybe

Ninety eight do quote those exactly but they're pretty darn close\nAnd so um I think it tells you a lot about the nature of the race that sentiment has said I Am the person that's in the middle that's going to work with both sides\nAnd Martin mix Sally has said I'm all in with Donald Trump now there are more Republicans and Democrats in this state\nBut I think what this election will tell us\nIs is there any center left in American policy or a center remaining to be clear about that is there any center remaining in American politics if there is cinema wins if there's no center left then maybe Martha ... will win 'cause there's more Republicans and Democrats the fascinating thing\nBut I think what this election will tell us is is there any center left in American policy or a center remaining to be clear about that is there any center remaining in American politics if there is cinema wins if there's no center left then maybe Martha big Sally will win 'cause there's more Republicans and Democrats\nThe fascinating thing and this gets really to the question of the blue wave because we don't see numbers suggesting a blue wave by massive democratic turnout turnout but I think that's a mistake in a misunderstanding\nThe blue wave is going to be turning a Reagan Democrats into cinema or Republicans effectively so you've got people who I think are going to be from the right middle ride\nVoting for cinema uh that are not showing up as the their the independence or the or the center right\nOr Republicans and that's I think what's going to be seen in that race ultimately it's been back and forth a bit\nUh but fundamentally Kirsten Sinema has a party that's more willing to accept her moderation than the Republican Party is to accept a Martha ... moderation and that's why she had to run to the right because she was also governing from the middle\nIn the district she was in as a congressperson Pierson has been able to because CD nine is so moderate she was able with the benefits of the Democratic party to vote more right when she needed to\nUh and as a result has a record now that despite her long past of being a very hard left she's been able to step away from that very effectively and that's why Martha ... got such a challenge and I think there's a difference too they\nBoth migrated but Kirsten Sinema moderated Twenty years ago a mind to make Sally moderated since the last election so there's there's that issue uh I I think that a\nHas not been a congressperson that long and she didn't moderate that recently and all you know Arizona alleges yeah she didn't moderate even ... she was still\nI think there's a difference too they both migrated but Kirsten Sinema moderated Twenty years ago a mind to make salad moderated since the last election so there's there's that issue\nUh I I think that a\nPerson has not been a congressperson that long and she didn't moderate that recently Arizona legends yeah she did moderate even ... she was still pretty far left I got to disagree with you on that I think though in her congressional race in her congressional service\nShe has done brilliantly to come out in the middle and as a result her ... her her position demonstrates that\nYou I Want to ask you about something that you brought up about the uh about the blue wave in the early ballots coming in and and turnout and all that and we keep seeing that you know at least in Arizona with the early ballots coming in typically Republicans are a candle eleven percent give her give or take over Democrats\nAre we making a mistake to assume that those numbers will dictate the outcome it seems as though that assuming that every Republicans voted voters voting for just Republican that's correct\nAnd I think what you're seeing is Donald Trump's a delta with women is so large\nThat uh go through an sort those ballots coming in with the demographics and I think you're going to see that uh the surprise will be how many of those women\nRepublicans remained Republicans decided that they the Trump effect is big enough now on the top of the tickets for the Republicans in the state you've got to see\nDoing a very effective job ... Garcia having gone so far left he's actually I think harming the down ticket races I think Hobbs would have done better or had Garcia run the race he ran four years ago I think everything even January ... would have done better had\nHad she had somebody at the top of the ticket not giving the impression that the entire Democratic Party has gone far left and that that gubernatorial campaign and the money spent there is given that impression I only take so much Garcia has moved further\nHarming the down ticket races I think Hobbs would have done better uh had Garcia run the race he ran four years ago I think everything even January ... would have done better had\nHad she had somebody at the top of the ticket not giving the impression that the entire Democratic Party has gone far left and that that gubernatorial campaign and the money spent there is given that impression I only take so much\nGarcia has moved further left I think do see has been brilliant in portraying him as if he had moved far left by the way this whole thing about the book coming in the I look at those numbers and not only do they trend Republican they do so by a little bit more than four years ago\nBut in the context I can think of about ten indicators that are out there\nAnd you know things like an interest in the election by party or the generic vote and chat and all that and all of the others do suggest blue wave this is an anomalous number\nAnd I don't pretend understand it I Will I Would however to put it in context it's the only date him out there that suggest kind of a pro Republican a message a joke\nAnd all the others say say pro Democrat out your your explanation could be right it could be there's more Republicans out there but but they're they're swing voters there you go to vote for some Democrats this time maybe that's the case to me I see mostly as\nOne anomalous piece of information\nOr the conventional wisdom is that in general Republicans do better in early voting Democrats are better at turning out people aren't election day he is there a number at which you have Republicans are up by some number\nIn early voting it might not be enough to make up for what Democrats could potentially turn out on election day does that number exist in the last hour I was advised by one of\nYour a ... a featured speakers that one should not to play the game of ah looking into a crystal\nBall [laughter] a lot of shattered glass so\n... is there a number at which you've Republicans are up by some number\nIn early voting it might not be enough to make up for what Democrats could potentially turn out on election day it does that number exist in the last hour I was advised by one of your a ... a featured speakers that one should not to play the game of ah looking into a crystal\nBall but [laughter] a lot of shattered glass so I'm not going to touch that one but this poster guy probably has a better idea\nOr not really not really I mean I'm say I you look at all the indicators and until I looked at that one indicator and I said that is putting in a different direction\n[noise]\n... says it's a perfect match for the scanner on going and video with menacing music and they finished in the ... warning that ...
