Jay Z News Phoenix\nAnd the story came right after an official announcement from ASU which cages easiest Casey can watch and she's here now to tell us more ... so you were able to report this pre announcement what did you learn post announcement\nRight so the announcement yesterday came with a lot of talking about the importance of community service ASU president Michel crow weighed in and said the whole purpose of a public university like ASU is to give back to the public that actually uses that services\nThe past of exclusion for the development of institutions of higher education particularly public institutions of higher education is\nWrong wrong\nYeah flash [noise]\nAnd so that's kind of the same line of talking about they all talked about for about an hour while they were making it so that's been and it is a thirty million dollar gift so it's a pretty big deal in the school says it's one of the biggest gift that they've ever gotten\nRight right so the couples who gave the gift Cindy and Mike watch their local business owners and now the new college that houses the criminal justice and community programs named after them tell us about them\nYet so they were there um and I've been told so far that they don't really want a whole lot of publicity but they did mention that they lived and grew up in Maryville I as we heard the community has was developed originally for the working class and has basically stay that way it's just\nGone from a majority white two majority Hispanic and the median income level is actually one of the lowest in the city so\nThey're gift is going to help create the Mary\nTell us about them yet so they were there um and I've been told so far that they don't really want a whole lot of publicity but they did mention that they lived and grew up in Maryville I as we heard the community has was developed originally for the working class and has basically stay that way it's just\nGone from a majority white two majority Hispanic and the median income level is actually one of the lowest in the city so\nThey're gift is going to help create the Maryville revitalization project in one square mile initiative so as we all know universities are very good at creating a mouthful and um that's going to include a program called the design studio for community solutions\nOkay so let's actually here from Cindy watts who spoke yesterday and got pretty emotional as she and her husband explained that they were really honor to give the gift\nIgnorance is a great source\nSuffering and our intention is to be able to levy a suffering through all these programs\nAnd so all of this to say that they want to ask you to have a lasting program that's going to help put these uh usually prestigious and exclusive resources out into their hometown in other communities\nTo like you said the design studio for community solutions are brand new program of along name can you describe a little more of what exactly it's supposed\nTo accomplish yeah I asked that question to 'em and it's just really brand new so there's a lot of details that still need to be hammered out I did speak to our cool like you've heard in the story he did give me a little more information and\nUm it sounds like to me kind of through my interpretation that they're hoping to at least in some small way changed the way Maryville is thought of by people who live in Phoenix than by people who don't live in Maryville either so\nOne place they're starting is data just collecting it and kind of painting that overall picture of Maryville so they know where to start 'em and just everybody knows I've worked in Maryville personally for three years now at our west valley bureau and it's kind of frustrating sometimes the looks of comments I get when I tell people that so I get where everyone is coming from right tell us a little bit\nChange the way Maryville is thought of by people who live in Phoenix than by people who don't live in Maryville either so one place they're starting is data just collecting it and kind of painting that overall picture of Mary ... so they know where to start out\nAnd just everybody knows I've worked in Maryville personally for three years now at our west valley bureau and it's kind of frustrating sometimes the looks of comments I get when I tell people that so I get where everyone is coming from\nRight tell us a little bit more about that what's your experience been working there\nYeah I mean it's been a great experience I haven't really experienced anything too negative there um it does flood when it's right like this I Will say on Thomas but I think that's not unusual um and I work with a lot of high school students too and they\nAre kind of have a very similar frustrated mentality that we heard in the story from Korean of kind of being like we are just as good as everyone else and maybe we don't feel like we get the resources to accomplish what we really could achieve mhm\nAnd call you said that also thinks that one of the biggest parts of the programs to figure out how exactly it will help married now right so ah yeah that's exactly what he said and here is\nOne of the challenges is in a broad village like that it's hard to track your outcomes and we want to be very focused on measurements in progress\nRight so it's kind of all squishy right now but they're going to need to get some sort of a way to figure out if this is actually making a difference so we'll have to see going forward exactly how this investment in projects are going to work and that could be an uphill battle\nAlright cages

how political protest affected those outcomes\nAs with me to talk about that period of time at current protests as well as a professor what is the power of protest and do you get the impression that this recent string of protests is more sustainable\n[noise] yes I Would agree with that I think protests over the last couple of years especially following the elections have really increased um their more individuals going out putting forth their planes hitting the streets in what what's really interesting about protests this time around is that they are\nAnd those are things that I'm sure emergency managers would say you should not wait until the last minute to do but in some cases if you need to do that you you can you can run out to the grocery store at the last minute assuming they still have food doing things like making sure there's a proper procedure for getting rid of coal ash is not something you can do with the last minute\nHow far out in advance to some of these things have to be considered\nSo this is a long standing policy challenge or not just in North Carolina uh uh other locations I'm generally speaking to put it in simple terms it's probably not the best idea in the world to put highly toxic materials in unwind disposal pits\nAre near waterways [laughter] but it seems a sensible but there are reasons why companies do that and it has they tend to put plants next waterways because they knew the water for their for their process is\nYou're right you can't fix that problem quickly and so um we won't know for a while the extent of the harm to the environment until we do further testing and find out what the actual release of of toxic for\nA lot of people the idea of regulation especially environmental regulation is something that they're not huge fans of Melanie I'm Wondering if you know in an area where you\nQuickly and so um we won't know for a while the extent of the harm to the environment until we do further testing and find out what the actual release of of toxic\nFor for a lot of people the idea of regulation especially environmental regulation is something that they're not huge fans of Melanie I'm Wondering if you know in an area where you are maybe prone to disasters\nOr their particular regulations that might make sense that are not terribly burdensome in normal times we could be helpful during an emergency\nSo I'd like to reframe this regulation term a little bit and just think more about it in terms of\nA tool to manage risk because that's really what regulations are so as you implement regulations on any kind you know can be related to the environment can be related to building codes anything you know you drive and your vehicle safety standards those all regulations but the attendance\nApproaches to manage the risk to harm to life harm to property so environmental regulations or these risk management tools are really tools governmental tools\nTo find the balance worth the risk level we want to live with so when you when you say you know what a good mind all regulations on how many how much regulation do we want to have the question ultimately is with how much risk do you want to live\nAnd that's interesting that you mentioned things like building codes or or things like that because in a place that is prone to earthquakes for example that would be very important or you know maybe some places have requirements to clear the area around your house a certain amount to protect against wildfires things like that\nDo people residents not talking about emergency managers but residents think of those things as risk mitigation tools or do they see them as\nMentioned things like building codes or or things like that because in a place that is prone to earthquakes for example that would be very important or you know maybe some places have requirements to clear the area around your house a certain amount to protect against wildfires things like that\nDo people residents not talking about emergency managers but to residents think of those things as risk mitigation tools or do they see them as a as something else I have to do\nSo I think it depends on the environment of the community people living so residents who live in urban ... interfaces while they're used to these kind of hazards\nTo them I Would say these are normal procedures but in areas possibly where people are not as familiar with the hazard it's also not something they think about doing because they don't realize what they on their own could do to minimize the risk\nSo burned is is to some degree come down to maybe like a perception issue that if people really think that by doing something that they can make a difference in their lives and maybe protect themselves or their families or their property as opposed to maybe something slightly more abstract\nI think a useful way to to think about these kinds of issues is that humans tend to learn from experience\nAnd usually a people make appropriate adjustments after they have an experience so this is true on an individual level it's true on a governmental level\nThat communities that have experienced a disaster to become more familiar with the hazard you become more familiar with what the risk is\nAnd so it's partly perception as as your question or indicated but it's also partly a learning from experience and as a consequence um if you look at community that I've had a major disaster they'll make appropriate adjustments in\nPublic policy than regulatory efforts and mitigation effort\nOne constraint lead that local emergency managers\nOh you're with what the risk is and so it's partly perception as as your question or indicated but it's also partly a learning from experience and as a consequence or if you look at communities at I've had a major disaster they'll make appropriate adjustments in\nPublic policy than regulatory efforts and mitigation effort\nOne constraint read that local emergency managers face is the ability actually to spend\nMoney and invest on pro active mitigation measures because if you think about it\nIf your local county government or your local municipality needs to spend millions of dollars on building a levee or something like that\nOr a damn it's not something you see immediate benefits from it of course you know you see benefits if they build a new school or improve roadway so there you have tangible benefits but with avoiding losses down the road you invest in\nTrying to avoid adverse impacts and that's I think very difficult to sell\nAnd also difficult to invest based on the way funding is structured right now because the federal government spends a lot of money after a disaster after community has been impact but there's just not that many funds to go around pre disaster to mitigate natural hazard\nAll right Melanie goal and Brian\nGerber our co directors of the center for emergency management and homeland security at ASU guys thanks for coming in thinking rank you\nIt's been hot

Ninety One point five ... in Phoenix thanks for joining us this hour coming up nearly half of Arizona high school grads are not going on to college what's behind that new finding and why some women are getting preventive surgeries to limit their risk of getting certain kinds of cancers\nBut first a judge has finished hearing arguments in a case challenging a recent a PS rate increase the complaint was filed earlier this year and argues rate payers bills went up more than advertised by the utility around Redondo covered the hearing for the Arizona Republic joined just out good morning right morning\nSo this was led by a rate payer Stacey champion what was the argument there uh she was arguing that the rates\nAre unreasonable and that many people were seen much more than the six dollar a month average increase that was described both by abs and by the regulators when they made this decision more than a year ago\nHow complicated to get at the time when the rate hike was approved because how quickly did it seem that people became concerned about what they were seeing other bills\nAbout a year ago I started to get calls so the new rates went into effect around

bills\nAbout a year ago I started to get calls so the new rates went into effect around September depending on what billing cycle you are on and it was about October last year I started getting customers calling me\nThat happens a lot after rate hikes I frequently look at people's bills they'll share that with me and I'll explain well there was more days in the billing cycle this time where you used more energy or you use more energy\nLate in the day or on peak and that's what it costs them money but I was getting customers sending me bills that were up by not six dollars not even close to six dollars by like thirty dollars\nAnd I would look at him and say that's not near ... percent increase that was described and um so I I started asking questions of abs and uh so it started right away as soon as these new rates went into effect\nI Wonder this being launched by al right hand and says you can't be an NPR here as well the I mean and encourage starting teaching and getting the hearing and going through all of this is going to be a really long extensive process how unprecedented is that\nIt's highly unusual for a U.S citizen activist to get this much traction at the corporation commission and I've got an ad it's also unusual that Stacy champion is a pretty progressive liberal activist and she has brought this challenge to\nFive Republican commissioners who passed as a rate hike on a four to one vote but still it's an all Republican commission\nAnd she has gotten you know they just finished five days of hearings on this case so based on what you said\nAbout the fact that you were getting these calls early on what is a PS saying a PSA well we didn't anticipate this are they saying kind of what you initially we're thinking well you know rates go up if you don't know when you're using your energy that kind of it so they've\nGot a few explanations for this the first one I got last fall around November was that it was hot out but the other explanation and

for this the first one I got last fall around November was that it was hot out but the other explanation and unfortunately we had to hear this sort of basic explanation [noise] excuse me a math\nBoth recently had surgery to remove their fallopian tubes preventative measure that they hope more women will consider\nI sat down with both of them recently to talk more about that decision and the

recently to talk more about that decision and the broader movement of women using things like genetic testing preventive surgeries to hedge their risk of getting cancer is like this\nThey told me when their mother started experiencing some discomfort in her stomach she sought treatment from several doctors but none of them seemed alarmed by her system some symptoms for\nSymptoms became worse and worse and worse and at that point I was seven months pregnant and\nOr mom who was very thin started to look almost as pregnant as I was and you could just see in her eyes that something wasn't right and so she kept knocking down doctors' doors looking for answers and it wasn't until one day when she couldn't get out of bed to go watch Arizona State play football\nThat her friends really started to notice that something wasn't right and one of our good friends here in Phoenix is an emergency room doctor and he called and said you know at Sunday it's my day off why don't we walk\nThrough the CAT scan and we'll just do a bunch of major test to rule anything big out and let's see why you're not feeling normally\nAnd at that point she was diagnosed with stage three the ovarian cancer\nWow so that's almost just a helping hand like that that sounds like it was harder than it should have been to find that diagnosis right it was\nHarder than it should have been and without this friend in our lives I don't know how much longer it would have taken for her to get answers so we recognize that we were extremely lucky because\nNo one was taking her seriously and no one was listening and it could have been another few months before they got answers and by that point she probably wouldn't have had any time left\n'em so your your mother passed away in twenty Thirteen right um and since then you have started this foundation and her name uh and it sounds like you're focusing a lot on this idea of presents\nNo one was taking her seriously and no one was listening and it could have been another few months before they got answers and by that point she probably wouldn't have had any time left\n'em so your your mother passed away in twenty Thirteen right um and since then you have started this foundation and her name uh and it sounds like you're focusing a lot on this idea of prevention and awareness\nOf what are some of the challenges that obviously popped up in your mother's case in terms of\nRecognizing ovarian cancer to begin with for women\nGosh there's so many it so I'm the first was that the signs and symptoms generally for women are there so we need to educate women to know these signs and symptoms but also equally as important doctors need to recognize the signs and symptoms\nThe biggest challenge with ovarian cancer is that there is no early detection screening tool so a lot of women think when they go to the gynecologist and they got a pap smear that they're looking for ovarian cancer and they're not a pap smear only test for cervical cancer\nAnd so without an early detection screening tool many women are diagnosed in late stages when it's almost too late\nRight there is no mammogram for this there is no mammogram okay so without that um both of you because of your mother you said are at higher risk for ovarian cancer\nSo you've decided to do something pretty extreme like I get an elective surgery in prevention tell us about what it is that you did and and why I'm scientifically that was a good way to go for you\nWhat has become a parent to research over the past few years there believing that ovarian cancer is actually originating from the fallopian tubes\nSo what happens is I think that it comes out of the fallopian tubes in somewhat sprinkles onto the ovaries which is why it's so difficult to diagnose early because it starts in this little tiny area and by the time that is released\nWhy am scientifically that was a good way to go for\nWhat has become a parent to research over the past few years there believing that ovarian cancer is actually originating from the fallopian tubes\nSo what happens is I think that it comes out of the fallopian tubes in somewhat sprinkles onto the ovaries which is why it's so difficult to diagnose early because it starts in this little tiny area and by the time that it's released onto the ovaries it's actually released into the entire abdominal cavity\nAnd said before you know it it's like a sand last all over\nThe entire inside of your stomach and organs and whatnot which is\nA clearly why it goes from zero to sixty and become so deadly\nYou know to now know that you can take out your fallopian tubes with very little risk and so really minor procedure\nAnd you know that alone doesn't impact you know your ability to create hormones through your ovaries and ah if you want to you could continue to keep your uterus but you know taking out that connector piece is a could decrease your ovarian cancer a risk significantly so\nYou know for me in in thinking about it that was that's a no brainer it to me it's a it's a no risk all reward type procedure a it was something I knew I was going to do\nI have to say in general and the decision um it was extremely emotional for me\nMostly because our mom after a little sister was born she had had um an emergency hysterectomy\nAnd back then they saw no reason to take the fallopian tubes or they left her ovaries for obvious reasons for the hormones but they kept her fallopian tubes and through many discussions with\nUm the ... colleges that we have developed relationships with over in the past\nShe had had um an emergency hysterectomy and back then they saw no reason to take the fallopian tubes uh they left her ovaries for obvious reasons for the hormones but they kept her fallopian tubes and through many discussions with\nUm the guy a nickel ethical on college is that we have developed relationships with over the past\nEleven years and through our own it just had she had those removed she very very likely have never gotten ovarian cancer and she'd still be here today so it's an opportunity she didn't get\nAnd I actually feel very blessed that reached research has advanced enough that um it's something that we can do and it's something that we can share the word about to others\nNicole why did you decide to do this as well\nFor me it was really important to take these measures because I have three young children and after going through what we went through with losing our mom at a young age and watching other women who are in their thirties and forties fight for their lives and\nWant so desperately to be around for their children I just felt like the best opportunity that I have to decrease my risk\nOf this terrible disease that we know so much about was to go through the surgery and through our foundation calling stream we're constantly educating women about the signs and symptoms knowing their family history to seat genetic counseling and testing\nAnd to know what their options were and it was time for us to basically walk the walk it must've been a little scary though going into this and knowing that it might not make any difference at all but you thought that it was something that could help\nWhat do you tell them than when they're contemplating this [noise] you know it's difficult because every Woman's Journey is different and you really have to take women as they are we have educated a lot of women on their options and watch them go through genetic testing and it's fascinating to see how everyone response definitely we recently had\nLittle scary though going into this and knowing that it might not make any difference at all but you thought that it was something that could help\nWhat do you tell them than when they're contemplating this\nYou know it's difficult because every Woman's Journey is different and you really have to take women as they are\nWe have educated a lot of women on their options and watch them go through genetic testing and it's fascinating to see how everyone response definitely we recently had a friend who was diagnosed and she went through a full has tracked me had her ovaries removed slope and who was removed and for her it was a no brainer and we've seen other people who've been diagnosed with\nDifferent genetic mutations who are almost paralyzed by the information and don't know what to do and so it's really important to seek the proper genetic counseling so you can do your options and you need\nTo also also be ready to seek ... therapy if you need it because you know these are life changing decisions when you remove your fallopian tubes\nYour your your compromising their fertility and you know the the other is a lot to think about a lot of different factors at play and so it's very personal it's very complicated and it's not a one size fits all mhm [noise]\nSo this is becoming more common right to do this kind of thing these sort of elective preventative surgeries um we've obviously heard stories about women getting double mastectomy because they're a high risk for breast cancer now um there are people who are getting hysterectomy is to prevent this sort of cancer uterine cancer cervical cancer or something like that\nWhat do you think about the rise of this and the knowledge that women have that they didn't have before that can be a blessing but also maybe a burdens\nOr the best way to look at it is that the information is it's powerful and it can also be very liberating it's taking your future into your own hands uh for me to not know or or to to not be able to take the bull by the horns for lack of a better analogy and and to do some\nThen have that they didn't have before that can be a blessing but also may be a burden\nOr the best way to look at it as that the information is it's powerful and it can also be very liberating it's taking your future into your own hands uh for me to not know\nOr or to to not be able to take the bull by the horns for lack of a better analogy and and to do something with much scarier than than doing it so I I think that if you know women really could\nDive in more and and be able to really control their destiny they can feel more empowered by by what their future might look like rather than you know turning a blind eye to it\nDo you think your mom would be happy that this is something you bust done\nAbsolutely she encouraged us to do that I'm One of her biggest fear is was that we would go through something like she went through All right\nNicole Condes and Michelle that Gillette thank you so much coming in I think you think yeah\nDeep research continues as progressing on whether it makes sense for people to have preventive surgeries and under what circumstances but this was dumped tracked who's involved in that area specifically related to breast cancer that was the director or the bachelor Center for ... for be RCA at the University of Pennsylvania and she's with us now\nStarted dumped her what sort of dramatic changes are you seeing in the field the genetic research and how is that affecting with the people choose to have these preventive surgeries\nField of genetics has been rapidly expanding and we're learning more and more about it all the time including how to use genetic information to help reduce risk and decide on specific\nProphylactic procedures but it's worth stating that fear the one in ... to the most commonly known cancer susceptibility genes were identified in Nineteen Ninety four Nineteen Ninety five so this is still relatively new and we know a lot about those genes but we know a lot less about other genes that we use\nHow to use genetic information to help reduce risk and decide on specific\nProphylactic procedures but it's worth stating that ... to the most commonly known cancer stepped ability genes\nWere identified in Nineteen Ninety four Nineteen Ninety five so this is still relatively new and we know a lot about those genes but we know a lot less about other genes that we've discovered and and uh really started to study over the last several years\nSo this is a burgeoning field it's very important that people know their family history and if they're appropriate candidates for genetic testing at that time that they can make an informed decision\nWhen it comes to the sort of thing when it comes to what a patient is considering what to do we're the ethics involved for for a doctor up ultimately it's the the individual decision but should doctors provide some sort of get by some is uh and when it comes to to this idea the concept that he'd been doing that or an ethical line but may or may not be crossed\nAnd you know as a reminder again you oversaw you at the U.S department of health and Human Services administration for children and families are under the Obama administration and that's when the first ten cities were used for these kids can you tell us why\nAnd you know as a reminder again you oversaw you at the U.S department of health and Human Services says administration for children and families are under the Obama administration and that's when the first ten cities or use for these kids can you tell us walk us through the decision then to use these\nShore of ... we did use military facilities in twenty four team or are they are in various ways the physical there are some physical differences between what these arrangements look like and what those did\nBut basically what happened in twenty fourteen\nIs there was a very large unexpected increasing the number of arriving children it had been um ranging in about two to three thousand a month and then that spring it went up to six thousand than nine thousand and ten thousand\nSo the numbers were very large we didn't have\nAdequate shelter capacity for them\nAnd so we turn to the department of defense\nAnd used a Defense Department facilities they would be known in the jargon as influx facilities and the reason that we needed to do that is that normally the shelters for the children are state license and state regulated when you have to increase\nThe shelters in a hurry it's not possible to go through state licensing process\nSo that's why we did it but that's really different than\nThe current situation where again it's not because of a sudden anticipated surge it's because of policies and the enforcement environment [noise]\nState licensed in state regulated when you have to increase the shelters in a hurry it's not possible to go through the licensing process\nSo that's why we did it but that's really different than the current situation where again it's not because of a sudden the anticipated surge it's because of policies and the enforcement environment\nI'm curious the federal government openness tent encampment in ... Texas back in June and you've visited this camp can you tell us when it was like\nA at the time I was there they had a a twenty housing tents set up and then a number of other tent sure a dining hall and\nHealth care facilities and things like that but it and then each of the tent set up to house children you had a ten sets of bunk beds are said twenty beds in each tempt 'em\nAt the time it was set up for about four hundred people and it's now expanded dramatically and can house up to thirty eight hundred children\nI'm a ... the tensor ... condition which is a good thing now\nIn Texas at that part of the summer we had temperatures topping out at about one of seven at that point in time ah so you know the children were well taken care of ... from what I could see well fed I'm not being educated um uh there's no school and going on there\nUm a a and at the time because it was so hot that the children weren't allowed outside after eleven in the morning a now those restrictions would have eased a bit a dumb because the high temperatures now or in the low nineties is much much safer for children\nUm they're both boys and girls house their their house in a separate facilities and\nDo not a a a period of main goal uh yeah and when I was there which was right after it opened in June you did have a handful of children who had been forcibly\nLebanon in the morning a now those restrictions would have eased a bit a dumb because the high temperature now or in a low nineties is much much safer for children um they're both boys and girls house their their house in a separate facilities and\nDo not a a a period of main goal uh yeah and when I was there which was right after it opened in June you did have a handful of children who had been forcibly separated from their parents at the border but for the uh for the vast\nMajority of kids who were there then and who are there now these are the children who arrived at the border without a parent or guardian and then were taken into government custody now\nYou know in the past as mark mentioned it you know they they were able to place children much more quickly now on an average of about thirty days or during the Obama administration is what kids spent in detention\nThat number is now up to at least fifty nine days on average probably significantly higher now because I think that figure dates to uh sometime in August uh to have children just staying\nLonger and longer in these facilities and it's also worth noting those averages do not include kids who just are placed with sponsors so even those numbers are a bit misleading their their therefore they're in a shelter for a very very long time now\nIf you're just joining us I'm speaking with Bob Moore and mark Greenberg and we're talking about tent cities being used to house unaccompanied migrant children mark ... you know we how are these facilities supposed to work exactly and going off of what\nBob was just describing and I want to bring it to a section for the New York times article that was written about that same facility tornado in Texas and it said that\nYou know the children or lie or sleeping bunks there's no school they're given work books that they have no obligation to complete an access to legal services is limited and that's again from the New York times my is are these facilities functioning\nFacility supposed to work exactly and going off of what Bob was just describing I Want to bring in a a section from New York Times article that was written about that same facility toward any attacks us and it said that\nYou know the children are lie actually begin banks there is no school they're given a work books that they have no obligation to complete and access to legal services is limited and that's again from the New York times markets are these facilities function the way they were intended to function\nSo\nGoal should be to not have to use influx facilities the\nSystem normally operates with a set of standards shelters which as as I had noted or our state licensed state regulated provide a range of services to the children including\nEducation and legal services and recreation and mental health\nAnd health and case management\nAnd others so that's the way the system is supposed to work\nThe problem is that children are spending longer and longer in the shelter system and the lack of capacity has forced the administration to turn to these influx shelters the influx shelters are\nNot state licensed are regulated\nThey are having to set them up very quickly\nUm for the children and um the concerns are are fundamentally that it is not a good thing\nFor children to be in a mass shelter and particularly to be in a mass shelter for an extended period of time it's stressful it's difficult for mental health it increases\nThe risks of children and acting out it's hard on staff and\nConcerns are are fundamentally that it is not a good thing for children to be in a mass shelter and particularly to be in a mass shelter for an extended period of time it's stressful it's difficult for mental health it increases\nThe risk of children acting out it's hard on staff\nAnd I should also noted is hugely expensive for government so it's really not in my view in anybody's interest to be operating in flux shelters for extended periods of time like a\n[noise] and I'm Wondering and about a Fifteen seconds or ... what do you see it's a long term impacts of this\nThe biggest concern here is how long the children are staying in shelters that they're not being released to their families\nAnd that has happened because health and Human Services is increasingly playing the role of a partner in immigration enforcement and his wall goes that operates that way there is a risk that the number of children in shelters is going to keep going up\nIn up Bob more as an independent reporter who covers the border mark Greenberg is a senior fellow at the migration Policy Institute and we did reach out to ha says for comment and have not heard back yeah thank you both for your time I ... I went to take away [noise]\nAccording to the Maricopa association of governments there were more than sixty two hundred homeless people in Maricopa County at the end of January and more than twenty six hundred of them were sheltered at our long hot summers also where the direct cause of Ninety four homeless deaths for twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen\nBut a number of the homeless who've died don't have next of kin and who can be identified and contacted and that list\nAccording to the Maricopa association of governments there were more than sixty two hundred homeless people in Maricopa County at the end of January and more than twenty six hundred of them were sheltered at our long hot summers also where the direct cause of Ninety four homeless deaths for twenty sixteen and what he's Seventeen\nBut a number of the homeless who've died don't have next of kin and who can be identified and contacted and that leads to them being buried without much ceremony at the ... cemetery\nLauren casual of Arizona Republic wrote about homeless debts and as with me to talk about her story\nLauren do a lot of homeless deaths are attributed to exposure to the heat there are other causes for those homeless deaths what are some of those and and how would they researched\nIn Maricopa County medical examiner's office and said that not all homeless steps occur because of he associate heat association and many almost that's not happening because as\nAn accident or suicides and and two thousand Seventeen that America the county health department did come out with a report that said that Ninety four homeless individuals die between two thousand sixteen into thousands Seventeen because if he associated apps the medical examiner's office does investigate different death\nSaid it could be because as\nSetting and death or because it's something that seems unexpected or foul play is in might be suspected\nSo there could be a lot of things that are involved\nTypically when someone passes where there is a relative to be contacted there is someone who can take care of sort of the process of whether you call a funeral home or or and undertake or whatever it may be so if someone passes away he was homeless on the streets what is the process the county goes through for them\nSo for example I talked with and then people at the Andre house and many of their clients have passed away this summer and they spoke of one person\nWhere there is a relative to be taught to there is someone who can to troops or the process would you call a funeral home or or undertake or whatever it may be so if someone passes away he was homeless on the streets what is the process the county goes through for them\nSo for example I talked with some people at\nThe Andrea house and many of their um clients have passed away this summer and they spoke of one person named Diana I'm and she was actually found on the street and the medical examiner's office it came to came to her location um which was kind of near Dodger house and some other um\nFacilities they picked her up took her back to their office and so when that happens they kind of investigate the cause of death\nThey try to figure out her identity um so they might contact family members contact law enforcement to figure out who that person is what causes them to die and then and if they cannot get in contact with a family member\nThey will send that person's body to a funeral home many of the funeral homes are in contact with the public ... office with end Maricopa County", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Show", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "02"}
