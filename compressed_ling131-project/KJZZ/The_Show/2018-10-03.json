drinking habits some of the details that emerged from the hearings of parties and kegs and drinking to the point of blacking out\nThey're familiar to many of us either we've been there or we know

drinking binge any\nSolution\nTo all of life's problems\nSo let's be honest America\nDo we have a drinking problem\nWhy this is Joseph ... from west originally from ... ... ... a little out of control I grew up in France and wine and beer with Charles ... beverages when I moved back to New England to go to high school drinking was a big thing I had already been to nightclubs it was not a big deal for me to drink a beer and wine or not really considered alcoholic beverages for miners in Europe they should consider Tibet here\nHi I'm ... from St Louis I think casual drinking culture is so pervasive is actually here where I live\nI Do drink but not very often and it seems like there are so few social outlet that don't involve alcohol it makes it hard to abstain when one needs to or wants to buy a Nicholas\nFrom Westfield, Massachusetts education about appropriate alcohol consumption was really a family responsibility there is a responsible way they'll call people do need to be

Glazer is the author of her best kept secret why women drink and how they can regain control and Gabrielle says to understand modern party culture we have to go back quite a bit\nProhibition spawned a culture of binge drinking there were boos cruises off the shores of every coastal state\nPeople's socialized for the first time men and women socialized together and ... and the point of drinking during prohibition was to drink as much as you possibly could because you might be raided by the feds\nSo actually ironically prohibitions spawned a culture of binge drinking that has persisted for a hundred years\nChristina when we look at this from a public health perspective most of us when we get our annual physicals are doctors will ask us how often do you drink how much do you drink for researchers how do you look at how Americans drink\n[noise] that's a great question so we look at to several different pieces the first is actually just frequency of drinking and who is a drinker or is not a drinker so we know that about Seventy percent of American adults are past year drinkers the majority of Americans do drink\nThe next question would be sort of how frequently do you drink\nYou drink once a week or ... every single day only on weekends\nAnd then finally there's the question of heavy drinking so you've already referred to binge drinking which is defined as more and more drinks for a woman and five or more drinks per man in a given drinking episode and the given day and that sort of as the gold standard for what we consider to be heavy drinking are binge drinking but we also do know that um many ...\nYou drink you drink once a week or ... every single day only on weekends\nAnd then finally there's the question of heavy drinking so you've already referred to binge drinking which is defined as\nMore and more drinks for a woman in five or more drinks per man in a given drinking episode and the given day and that's sort of is the gold standard for what we consider to be heavy drinking or binge drinking but we also do know that um many Americans typically only consume one drink sometimes two drinks\nAnd there are increased risks for people drinking if you typically only have one drink and you consume three drinks and one given occasion so that's sort of magic number of binge drinking works at some sort of a population average which is what we look at it in public health but there are risks associated with lower levels of drinking potentially as well\nWho is drinking the most Christina do we have a sense of who is consuming the most alcohol in the United states particularly when it comes to heavy drinking\nYes unsurprisingly as those under age twenty five in the United states so college aged populations um those in college but also you know non college attending young adults drink the most although rates don't decline that much and we see a lot of people in the age range of forty five to sixty five there are a lot of\nAlcohol consumers although probably only about Fifteen to twenty percent of those in a that forty five to sixty five year old age range are binge drinkers are heavy episodic drinkers with any sort of frequency and heavy and binge drinking we often see in college age population\nUm this was something that we were thinking about in terms of culture in American culture and I'm Wondering how our society helps a ... that I think when I was in college I don't know if they do it anymore but there was ladies' night where you could pretty much get in for free and pretty much drink for free all night 'cause you know what do you see there and your research\nThe new trend that we're seeing is that actually\nStates population um this was something that we were thinking about in terms of culture in American culture\nAnd I'm Wondering how our society helps a full meant that I think when I was in college I don't know if they do it anymore but there was ladies' night where you could pretty much get in for free and pretty much drink for free all night because you know what do you see there and your research\n[noise] the new trend that we're seeing is that actually women are drinking more and more like men\nSo we're seeing a woman that they're drinking rates typically they've always consumed less alcohol and are binge drinkers last often as you recall that said that the binge drinking definition for women it's four drinks versus five drinks that sort of a lower level of our physiological but also some social reasons\nAnd um it this phenomenon that we are now observing that no one has fully explained yet we you know people are beginning to sort of guess at why that might be but that a lot of particularly college age women are beginning to drink like their male peers\nAnd so the overall rates of binge drinking or not increasing necessarily in the United states right now but we are seeing sort of closing the gap between genders particularly on college campuses and that's an area of some concern for a lot of public health and alcohol researchers\nCurious a Christian also at ... ... if you saw the hearing a and you saw the exchanges between a Brett Kavanaugh and uh the senators who were I'm questioning him when this issue came up\nThe elephant in the middle of the room\nThese days is Donald Trump that was the final straw for me when I saw Donald Trump coming down the escalator of the Trump Tower um the fact that he would be a legitimate Republican candidate and could could possibly win the nomination I didn't want any part of that and so that's what finally pushed me to change parties\nYour former elected official it's been a while but would you perspective have been dramatically different and how much is about as being calculated regret woods right now because when you are a private citizen and San frustrated with his party I'm going to change and because we know you well significant to us\nBut the broader public perhaps didn't really care but if you're running for office early for US Senate you were elected as attorney general as a Republican now running as a Democrat how much is the calculation change when you're an elected official running to be an elected official\nOr changes dramatically you have to be much more calculating if indeed you you want to run for office again\nUm you got a factor all that in for grant woods he isn't going to win a Republican primary Jeff Flake knew it in and got out so he really has no future if he wants to run for office again woods has no future in the Republican Party\nSo he has to decide do I run is in in ...\nDramatically you have to be much more calculating if indeed you you want to run for office again\nUm you got a factor all that in for grant woods he isn't going to win a Republican primary Jeff Flake knew it in and got out so he really has no future if he wants to run for office again woods has no future in the Republican Party\nSo he has to decide do I run as an independent\nOr do I run as a Democrat\nRent will have to go through a Democratic primary and that's the biggest obstacle for him\nWill high profile Democrats like Ruben a guy go et cetera step aside and allow grant woods to come in and when the Democratic party primary I'm no all do polling they'll decide whether they want to play it safe and stay in their safe districts\nSo that is yet to be determined but it is definitely a definite definite different calculation\nFor somebody who thinks they still want to run for office\nAnd a a private citizen\nWhat also is ... very different for grant woods right now and it's really the thing that has precipitated this whole discussion\nUm is the eulogy that grant woods gave a at in the Baptist church in North central Phoenix, Arizona John McCain's memorials um it was some herb\nAnd you saw a grant woods as a personality or not only were the things that he said touching but he had a sense of humor he talked about his past he was able you reminded people of his close connection and McCain and it gave him a new platform that he hadn't had in years\nThis is a moment in time than a lot of ways so in\nThis sense grant which can carry on what he had to do you uh gee the fact that he had this race history with Senator McCain and also even when he was attorney general he had an independent streak to some extent as well\nBut he had a sense of humor he talked about his past he was able you reminded people of his close connection and McCain and it gave him a new platform that he hadn't had in years\nThis a moment in time than a lot of ways so in\nThis sense ... can carry on what he had it to you is the fact that he had this race history with Senator McCain and also even when he was attorney general he had an independence streak to some extent as well yes he did\nSo let me ask a cynical question that so even if he starts running and actually determines he's going to run starts early next year to raise money and what not to be ready for twenty twenty because of the uniqueness of Senator McCain and uniqueness of their relationship and the uniqueness of a eulogy how much momentum does grant which carry\nConsidering as well he will be jumping to a new political party but it does seem chance in terms of actually getting elected\nYes don't underestimate grant woods as a politician he's going to use this moment in time\nTo springboard and become a Democrat and he has a lot of positive pressed and a lot of great reaction from from voters because of it\nBut he will he will instantly beyond the attack against Donald Trump\nAnd that'll be much easier to do as a Democrat he will be a very uh grew restive guy that that message also your fellow Democrats will be I can win the seat\nOr you may be able to find somebody in the Democratic party that has been in the party longer but look at the polling data let me show you the polling data I can win the seat this guy or this gal who's running for the for the primary camped\nAre definitely potential pitfalls for candidates are already elected officials who make the party switch Christian Gross associate professor of political science and public policy at USC has studied the electoral consequences of party switching by incumbent members of Congress he explains that trust\nLet me show you the polling data I can win the seat this guy or this gal who's running for the for the primary can't\nThere are definitely potential pitfalls for candidates were already elected officials who make the party switch Christian Gross associate professor of political science and public policy at USC has studied the electoral consequences of party switching by incumbent members of Congress he explains the trust becomes an even greater challenge\nThe research I've done shows the people who went from becoming a Republican to Democrat or a Democrat to Republican would have trouble connecting with a new party during the primary stage but it's a Republican becomes a Democrat\nDemocrats might not trust them immediately and there may be a primary challenge from somebody that Democrats are entire career and then similarly if the person made it to the general election that\nParty switchers still didn't do as well in the general from people who were in the older party because they also lost some trust with that or\nIs there a deeper theory there for you because they make certainly makes perfect sense to me at least from the primary standpoint building the general election you have people from both parties yeah independence voting you have people not affiliated with a party who may not feel that sort of duty betray us or can we trust him\nYeah I mean in the general election the theory is more\nOf a consistency right and so if you think about somebody like John McCain was a maverick and would vote conservatively and then all of our moderately his party label remained constant which allowed for him to um have that consistency in terms of presentation of voters when somebody switches parties especially has already been elected\nAs the other party it just create inconsistency and the voters'\nMinds almost like a flip flopping [noise] um and so that's where there's a lot of our pitfall it's less of a problem if the person has never held office before right so if you think about in California Arnold Schwarzenegger was Republican governor but he uh Ben I'm identified as an independent previously other\nJust parties especially who's already been elected as the other party it just creates inconsistency and\nThe voters' minds almost like a flip flopping um and so that's where there's a lot of our pitfall\nIt's less of a problem if the person has never held office before right so if you think about in California Arnold Schwarzenegger was Republican governor but he uh Ben I'm identified as an independent previously other people have run for office and\nHad been Democrats and become Republicans but it's before they run that they make the switch and then that's which is less uh there's less research on it and it's also less problematic because I'm the voters haven't identified with that party already because you're you're introducing yourself to the voters in the new party\nGraham woods who is here was elected as attorney general Arizona back in the nineties as a Republican but he and held office for about Twenty years is there anything to indicate that yes he he didn't hold elected office but it was such a long time ago any reason to think that's the sort of thing that would would weigh on someone or did you have to be fresher in voters' minds\nSo it needs to be fresh in voters' minds but it could still be an electoral pitfall\nUm again in a in a potential primary I think is where I Would see it as the the maintenance you stuff he's able to clear the field in the primary it may not be that big of an issue but um you know we can I think about various anecdotal cases Arlen Specter was a Republican senator surfer a longtime became a Democrat because he said the Republican Party left him\nAnd ran in the primary and he lost in the primary\nDue to a lot of attacks of him being a Republican or him being a former Republican\nUm and uh so you could imagine what was the same as she could come up with that could go back even though it was decades ago and talked about positions that were taken partisan statements that were made um ... my my advice to him it would be to get out in front of that and to define yet to find himself as a Democrat and\nTo talk about how the party is different\nAnd to talk about how the parties different under Trump than it was the night and I did\nDid you do any research or with what you looked into with party switching as to\nWhether some of the lack of trust or uncertainty among voters whether they're in the party you're out of the party whether that faded if a particular candidate let's say was elected as a Republican and then served sort of an equal amount of time did that loyalty did that trust or fear of those things did it fade over time\nStuff direct questions looked at all people who served in Congress since the Nineteen forties who switched parties and ran again and we found that in the election immediately after the switch the negative electoral impact was the biggest and then it dissipated over time so to elections out free elections out\nYou don't see the the effect of this which is much and so in this case where there's\nThe as time passes um after the party switch the chances of it having a\nA huge impact is lower but if it happened if the person ... right after the what's the impact that they really are\nChristian Gross is an associate professor of political science and public policy at USC [noise]\nGood morning you are listening to

three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year in today's dollars\nFrom his father's wealth and real estate empire by the time he was eight he was a millionaire and told all the president receive four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\nThat's according to a scathing investigation by the New York times one of the longest peace is ever published by the paper the investigation was based on more than one hundred thousand pages of documents it charted the financial history of the Trump family business and the extent to which Donald Trump profited off of the transfer of wealth from his father Fred Trump\nThe report detailed signs of tax evasion and very likely tax fraud involving sham corporations undervalued real estate holdings in schemes to avoid inheritance taxes\nIn total one billion that's billion with a beat dollars in wealth was transferred from the Trump parents to the Trump children instead of paying fifty five percent of tax on those funds the times investigation found that Trump's pay just five percent tax that's basically the equivalent of about five hundred million dollars in taxes that went unpaid\nJedi Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud\n[noise]\nFive percent tax that's basically the equivalent of about five hundred million dollars in taxes that went unpaid\nJedi Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud there certainly\nParts of this that are fraud there are parts of it that are um tax avoidance or tax minimization that is perfectly well within the confines of the law and then there are parts of that that you know very significantly cross the line\nAnd we of course should mention that the president's lawyer told the New York times that the allegation of tax fraud innovations were quote one hundred percent false and highly defamatory\nUm despite that the times found two hundred and Ninety five district distinct streams of revenue created by Fred Trump to help transfer this money to his son Donald Trump\nWhich is quite frankly I'm a pretty incredible and one of the ways that they did that was by creating a company called all county building supply and maintenance and they use that company to supposedly by things like cleaning supplies\nBut into times investigation they found that basically it was a shell company was the company on paper and they would mark up the costs of products as a way of transferring the money is on tax gifts is that tax fraud I Believe\nThat it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true\nUm this is tax fraud and I'm One of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS and this company had no economic substance it was nearly a way of funneling gifts\nI'm from the president's father too\nReview of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true\nUm this is tax fraud and I'm One of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS and this company had no economic substance it was nearly a way of funneling gifts\nI'm from the president's father to ah the president has siblings one\nOf the other things we mentioned at the top is that the uh the trumps also undervalued they're real estate properties\nAnd according to this investigation and the New York times Fred Trump's\nNineteen Ninety five gift tax return he claimed that twenty five apartment complexes he owned were valued at forty one point four million but the New York times says the bank value was actually near nine hundred million what about that is it clear that that's tax fraud\nIt's not as clear um because you need to understand the way that valuations occur um and the kinds of discounting that is is actually appropriate and in normal when looking at a minority interest in a company\nUm so you start with a value and if if that value is wrong then everything following it is wrong and in this case it looks like that value was probably wrong um but it's not as clear cut because we we don't have the competing evaluations\nDone by another expert as of the same approximate date we're looking at things that happened years after and things do change over the course of time\nUm I Would say that that does valuations are highly likely to be wrong um but whether it up and and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nI guess the question that this is sort of all coming from\nDate we're looking at things that happened years after and things do change over the course of time\nUm I Would say that that does valuations are highly likely to be wrong um but whether it up and and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nI guess the question that this is sort of all coming from our tax code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn our listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier\nFamilies in wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\nYeah I\nI think wealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need to be you know I think an important thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kicks in now this year if when you die you have more than a eleven million dollars\nSo it's not like these people are avoiding attacks that is generally applicable to the rest of the population like when they are avoiding income tax and other people are paying their fair share of income tax\nIn a state tax you know it's I it's a creation of Congress that only applies to the wealthy and then there are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay a and if you follow the rules um then you're abiding by the law the problem here is that the rules were not really followed\nIt feels like they weren't followed but it also I think for a lot of Americans who were coming up on you know wrapping in about a minute here but for a lot of Americans I think there's a sense of frustration among those of us who pay our taxes and don't you know find these loopholes and and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who\nHi I'm Phil Latzman and thanks for listening to K. Jay's easiest audio service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all of their accounting each find out for it you work part time controller\nDot com and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who kind of seem to be able to get around this ...\nI think that's more of a valid complaint with income tax with a state tax none of the rest of us pay estate tax do the wealthy pay estate tax\nYes significant portions of it and and you know sometimes they can minimize the amount that they have to pay\n... and what is that what you know is that normal behavior of the ultra wealthy in this country\nMinimizing the amount of state taxes absolutely normal behavior committing fraud to do it is not normal behavior or how do we distinguish the two you have to look at the amounts and whether the violation of allies will fall\nAnd um yeah the IRS has a whole set of penalties that that they used to apply based on how undervalued the properties we're in the estate tax returns Jay Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago thank you [noise]\nAnd that's ... to take away\n\n\nMorning you're listening to the show here on college easy easy at Ninety One point five and ... dot org the perfect mix BBC NPR in key jeeze easy news things so much for joining us we got here now coming your way in just about exactly thirty minutes that starts today at eleven\nWell more rain expected today in the valley we're going to sixty percent chance mostly cloudy\nGood morning you're listening to the show here on ... at Ninety One point five and ... dot org the perfect mix BBC NPR and key jeeze easy news things so much for joining us we've got to hear now coming your way in just about exactly thirty minutes that starts today at eleven\nWell more rain expected today in the valley we're going to sixty percent chance mostly cloudy otherwise with a high five\n\nIn the morning it's the show here on ...

Nineteen eighties the concrete walls that divided the German city of Berlin still stood on the east side the German Democratic Republic carried forth the Soviet Union agenda and tell it was toppled in Nineteen Ninety at the Cold War came to a close\nIn his new book burning down the house punk rock revolution and the fall of the Berlin Wall music journalist Kim more uncovers a little known story of a group of punk rockers in East Berlin\nWho's teenage rebellion became the spark that proved the power of the resistance\nI spoke with more and more about this and he told me at the time in East Germany there wasn't officially sanctioned music scene that was mostly dominated by bands that tried to sound like the purple but his story begins with a small group of teenagers they're who heard the Sex Pistols on western radio [noise]\nWhich ... says the pencils were saying things about living in ways that always wanted to put a stop to yet and that was the ... most of these kits\nRadio [noise]\nSupposed to switch for them there was as if they [noise] they filled the pencils were saying things are chuckling in ways that they always wanted to add hadn't hadn't talked to yet and that was a sport for most of these kids to get us to pump\nYou were in Berlin not long after all of this happened in Nineteen Ninety two he said you got there and tell us about how you found out about this group of teens and how you uncovered this story\nI was pretty clueless I was kind of a typical American in that I thought Germany October fest were basically the same thing and I expected to get out of the plane in Berlin and see everybody and later hosting Spanish giant one leader beers around\nAnd instead I landed in the high rise complex out in the far east part of the city\nIt was a big gray building surrounded by a bunch of other big grey buildings and was near the east or East Berlin zoo she hear the harrowing animals at night so it was a very different from October fest office you know I was kinda disappointed at first but then I discovered this whole scene that what's happening over there if you wanted to central parts of East Berlin and the old ah basically emptied dilapidated buildings\nThere were a lot of squats and a lot of interesting bars and clubs and galleries going in so behind these ... just a unbelievably colorful scene taking off and I ended up teaching in that scene for most of the nineties\nAnd by coincidence then meeting people who've been part of the eastern punk resistance so I landed amongst some coincidentally and then eventually wants to become friends with some of these people I was shown things that they kept hidden during the course of the dictatorship there was one guy in particular who had a a false bottom drawer during the dictatorship and he'd been the guitarist and one of the\nEarly east East Berlin bands and he showed me is actually a few lyrics sheets and photos of his friends and I realize that this was\nMeeting people who've been part of the Quran punk resistance so widely ended amongst them coincidentally and then eventually wants to become friends with some of these people I was shown things that they kept hidden during the course of the dictatorship there was one guy in particular who had a a false bottom drawer during the dictatorship and he'd been the guitarist and one of the\nEarly East Berlin Vance and he showed me is actually a few lyrics sheets and photos of his friends and I realized that this was this was something special something basically invisible it was a scene that no one had learned about\nI guess primarily because it wasn't covered in eastern media 'cause eastern but he didn't acknowledge oppositional type voices and for ideological reasons the posted never saw the tension in the western media the way a lot of other opposition groups did\nTell us more about this particular group and and and how dangerous for them at the time right like how dangerous was it to be in the pond scene at all or or to be rebellious in that way\nThe first parked in East Berlin was a Fifteen year old girl and she went by the name major [noise] and it didn't take long for ... to consider it a of a threat\nOne surprise for me in the research process was seeing the level of paranoia of the secret police towards this movement really quickly and of course I realized as I got deeper into it that that they were correct basically so eventually this does he started which is the name of the secret police to\nPut it in a major crackdown and the pumps ended up\nIn jail subject to daily detained meant an arrest and the beatings but what happened was the ...\nKept finding they basically a lot of them would go to jail come back out put the leather jacket on and keep going and that changed the game because other opposition money people could see that it was possible to resist and survive that was a game changing realization for the whole opposition scene so I think that leads to than in the second half of the eighties\nPeople taking approaches out into the streets and into the public eye and that's how it's able to\nWhat happened was the punks they kept fighting they basically a lot of them would go to jail come back out\nPut the leather jacket on and keep going and that changed the game because other opposition money people could see that it was possible to resist and survive that was a game changing realization for the whole opposition scene so I think that leads to than in the second half of the eighties\nPeople taking approaches out into the streets and in the public eye and that's how it's able to then snowball into the mass demonstrations that we know from Nineteen eighty nine\nSo this this sort of small group of what started as just you know teenage rebels really you think sparked something that really ended up being incredibly historically influential\nYeah they lost their fear the police of the secret police and and they steal to resolve it was a lot of the other opposition among people all these groups ended up interacting under the umbrella of the church the church was a safe space it a special status that didn't allow uniformed security forces to come into the churches so all the punk conscious took place in churches\nAnd that's also since they were harboring peace activists and human rights activists how these groups ended up finding common purpose and also the other group saw the extreme treatments at the pumps were subject to in the fact that they were still surviving and continue to fight and that that was the key I think\nLet's talk a little bit about the music and math right this is also about music on well are there are some songs are in bands that are really emblematic of that\nNot really there were all barred from the state media system so they couldn't record that couldn't distribute\nAnything like that they couldn't get on the radio uh and it was dangerous to even have your your music\nHeard and a lot of cases I mean as a as a musical phenomena that pretty much disappeared on November night Nineteen eighty on the night to the wall so one of these events is playing a show and towards the end of their set the crowd started to go crazy and they like the bans couldn't understand what's going on you know whether they were playing particularly well the night or whatever and\nAnything that they couldn't get on the radio and it was dangerous to even have your your music\nHeard a lot of cases I mean the other musical phenomena they're pretty much disappeared on November Nine Nineteen eighty on the wall so one of these ... play on the show and towards the end of their step across or to go crazy and they the demand for nurses on what's going on you know whether they were playing strictly while the night or whatever and they come down off the stage and are told\nTo waltz fault and they broke the ban is that like\n[noise]\nBasic version read your goals and achieve and in the future of the message and the music itself is going to have to change to fit the new political realities yeah\nSo it sounds like it started maybe about music that it was about much more than that clearly do you think that there's still a little bit of that true spirit in punk rock today or do you think that this has been\nLost I mean I I guess this was not like a widely known story and then you're sort of uncovering and I wonder if you listen a punk rock music today and feel like it's a a shell\nI think there was something ... about the way the couch their message in this really aggressive energetic music I think you know towards the dental and sometimes after shows people were literally run out of the churches and start spraying\nOppositional graffiti on Wall street\nShock\nOn on on\nSo there was definitely a magic to that mix I think that basically came up with the sort of a hand looked for was to authoritarianism that would have to be created in other ways for other settings\n\n\nSo there was definitely a magic to that mix I think they basically came up with the sort of a hand before was to torture and there's some that would have to be created in other ways for other settings including\nYou know I see one of the interesting things about working on the books for so long as we're about ten years to do the research and find all the people and you talk to\nAnd over that time it went from what was basically to me a fascinating story to something that was almost frightening relevant because during that time you had the Snowden revelations of our own mass surveillance and you saw the militarization of our police and the drastic reaction to protesters here in the states from black lives matter and the Parkland activists [noise]\nSo I don't think there's a direct analog it's not like we need to give a
