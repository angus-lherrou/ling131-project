E. P. or our special ed there are children who are bullied their children have depression or anxiety or host of other issues\nAnd we trust parents we trust parents to say you know what this educational environment isn't working for my child I like my child to be somewhere else and we want that not just for our children but for all Arizona children\nDon't are there any expansions of ... even if they're targeted or maybe even if it's a smaller number that isn't targeted desert any amount of expansion of years is that you think would be appropriate for the state right now\nWell the way the law is right now it expands every single year as the number of students in Arizona grows so too does room in the essay program so imposing an expansion like prop thrill five would\nWell Arizona children don't are there any expansions of yesterday's even if they're targeted or maybe even if it's a smaller number that isn't targeted is there any amount of expansion of us is that you think would be appropriate for the state right now\nWell the way the law is right now it expands every single year as the number of students and Arizona grows so too does room in the essay program so\nImposing an expansion like prop three o five would do that is not needed doesn't make sense there's already expansion for children with documented needs built into the existing law the existing law which would remain untouched by proposition three o five\nThe other faulty logic here is that if you are a huge fan of private school voucher is if you think that truly every child should get to have this then you need to vote no on prop three o five because it has a thirty thousand student cap or there about three percent of\nThe Arizona student population so while families who are currently using ... might be safe they only have to renew what about all those future special needs families who are competing for the rest of those thirty thousand slots\nAnd I just want to clarify about the cat because if this measure passes you just basically voter approve which makes it much harder for the legislature to change it so that's what you're saying that the cap is basically cemented in place unless the legislature can muster a super majority vote to change it\nCorrect so the argument that this is for all children that everyone should have a chance is invalidated by the fact that this has a cap on it which would be a voter protected\nSo whether you are opposed to private school voucher is because of the ways that they defund public and charter schools or whether you are in favor of them and think they should be for every child prop three o five doesn't get us to either solution\nWill Jenny and what's interesting about that is that we heard a right after the law\nA chance as invalidated by the fact that this has a cap on it which would be a voter protected so whether you are opposed to private school voucher is because of the ways that they defined public and charter schools or whether you are in favor of them and think they should be for every child prop three all five doesn't get us to either solution\nWill Jenny and what's interesting about that is that we heard\nA right after the law that this measure is trying to block past that some advocates were saying this is basically the first step to getting universal USA's we have a cat now but eventually we're going to get rid of the cabinet will be open to everybody but if this passes to Don's point\nIt won't happen because it's voter protected and changing voter protected laws are voter approved laws is very challenging is that a concern to folks on the side\nWell first if you corrections and there is a confusion on both sides as to whether it's motive protected because of how it was referred to the ballot but what we're talking about here is allowing\nPoint five percent of all public school children district or charter the opportunity for the next four to five years to choose a different educational by an environment that is a miniscule amount when we're talking about over one million children that currently access public schools\nLet me ask you about the financial aspect of this because there has been some reporting that some number of families who get the essays are not\nNecessarily low income families and that is challenging for some low income families because the amount of the essay does not match up with the amount of the school that the parents would like to send their kids to and they don't have the resources to make up that difference I'm Jenny is that a legitimate concern do you think\nWell I think that we want children to have educational opportunity and that can look like a variety of things that can look like public schools that can look like STO it can look like the empowerment scholarship I personally am hesitant to say what will and won't work for any family\nHim out of the school that the parents would like to send their kids to and they don't have the resources to make up that difference I'm Jenny is that a legitimate concern do you think\nWell I think that we want children to have educational opportunity and that can look like a variety of things that can look like public schools that can look like STO it can look like the empowerment scholarship\nI personally am hesitant to say what will and won't work for any family especially low income family voting yes on prop thrill five actually helps low income families and foster families more because right now the scholarship and now it's Ninety percent of the Arizona fines\nBut with a yes vote on prop three or five that amount increases for low income and for foster a for foster care children to a hundred percent so I Want them to have the opportunity to see if they can make the essay scholarship work for them and work with their school and had a choice I don't want to say no for it and\nDon't do you think that the debate over yesterday's and the debate over prop through five is kind of getting caught up in the larger argument about school choice in Arizona when in fact lots of school choice in Arizona isn't affected by prop through five\nThings like a open enrollment in charter schools you don't eat is yes he's for any of that so I'm Wondering if given that it's it's just a fraction of school choice in Arizona in terms of private or parochial schools do you think that this question has sort of gotten caught up in a larger discussion that maybe isn't relevant to it\nI think that one of the criticisms of you know the state of our schools Arizona and public and district ... charter advocates is that\nIt's about school choice but we know as you said that Ninety five percent of families are choosing public schools charter schools and so what it is is it's it's a disagreement over priorities we know that Arizona Republican charter schools are the lowest funded in the nation among\nKnow the save our schools Arizona and public and district charter advocates is that\nIt's about school choice but we know as you said that Ninety five percent of families are choosing public schools charter schools and so what it is is it's it's a disagreement over priorities\nWe know that Arizona Public and charter schools are the lowest funded in the nation among the lowest teachers are the lowest paid\nThe governor recently put a nice reinvestment into the schools but at the same time in the same legislative session prop three or five was moving through which poke holes in that funding bucket\nThe fact that those things were happening simultaneously is what prompted this parent and teacher outcry that we've seen over the course of the year and last year it's people saying we have priorities is Ninety five percent of us are making a certain type of choice\nFund our choice respect our choice\nJenny why why should funding not be a concern I mean if if Arizona schools and we've heard so much about how teachers aren't paid enough here and schools are not funded enough and district don't have textbooks in buses and counselors and all that sort of why why is is not a concern\nWell there's a few inaccuracies in a way that that was just presented a mainly that\nA district you not receive funds for children that are not in their classrooms are there and their schools in Arizona the way the funding works is that the money follows the child the money has always follow the child so if your child switches between district schools\nThe money follows that child to their new district school with the ESE programs that's exactly what's happening the money continues to follow the child\nInto an educational environment that is a better fit for them if the child was somehow left it to school and money was taken that would be a problem and we wouldn't support that that has education dollars are are\nMoney has always follow the child so if your child switches between district schools\nThe money follows that child to their new district school with the essay program that's exactly what's happening the money continues to follow the child\nInto an educational environment that is a better fit for them if the child was somehow left at

nominee for secretary of state a steep gainer he decided not to talk to us but the Democratic nominee Katie hubs did and I spoke with her about the job as some of her other views just in case you were to become governor I started by asking why she thinks she would be the right fit to be secretary of state\nWell I spent my whole career but as a social worker and in the legislature working to make government work better for the people of Arizona\nAnd that clearly needs to happen and the secretary of state's office there's a lot of mismanagement that needs to be turned around those with the election side which is probably the most high profile but on every single area a where the secretary of state provide services to the public\nMostly thrill an online portal there's problems and and and so the taxpayers of Arizona are getting the services that they're paying for that they deserve and there's a lot that needs to be fixed\nThere any specific she can offer as to where that goes

shelter one of the largest in the country at the time\nAnd so part of strategic a management budgeting decisions as well as my specific role making sure we are complying with all the laws and regulations\nBut I think in terms of turning around them as management office one of the first things I'll deal as a top to bottom review of all the areas of the office where improvements needed and then putting together action plans of how we can fix that and making sure that we are being very clear and transparent with the voters of what we're doing and how how we're making things better\nAnd how does your legislative leadership ...\nWell I think that um you know as the legislative leader um I've had the opportunity to uh to work with the members of our caucus and put forward a a unified agenda from the Democratic side of the aisle a but also um had a chance to really bring about some bipartisan when I worked with Governor DC\nTo end the backlog of untested rape kits are an Arizona

get a chance to clarify I'm really more interested in this job because somebody else just giving them or not so sure\nYeah I mean I watched the primary debates very closely and I was really frustrated with the way that she sort of tried to defend her actions in office because I felt like she was very much less than accountable to the people\nOf Arizona in terms of some of the really big mistakes that we saw happen I also wanted her to fight back harder against her opponent in the ways that he was really ... misrepresenting her record in office\nBut really I think for me obviously Michelle's not the point anymore to to me the job of managing our elections a cannot be taken lightly there is not room for rookie mistakes\nWe don't get the wars in elections and so we have to get it right the first time and and I think really one of her biggest mistakes was not really understand the magnitude of that\nTradition that you'd be able to do it on the water and really start to six weeks knowing

certain people have made missteps and what I Would do differently I think what people need a seat and the secretary of state's office as the chief election officer of the state as someone who is a leader\nAnd who is taking responsibility when mistakes are made but also acting in a very proactive manner to prevent those mistakes from happening that means working collaboratively with the county

not a partisan physician uses a position that can be done you're truly nonpartisan a bipartisan work\nI think not only can it be done it absolutely must be the secretary of state the person who oversees our elections\nThey have to be neutral on they cannot be viewed as having any part isn't an interest in in what happens in that office that is my commitment to the voters of Arizona is that it will absolutely run an office in a non partisan way and as much as possible take the politics out\nSo as most Arizonans though surgery state of course is number two in command and we do not know where they're still producing the sea of whoever that may be in that position from where do you think it is to be prepared to step to the floor of nude\nAbsolutely it is important um and you know voters\nHave the they deserve somebody in that office he wants to do that job but also who is ready to take leadership and the governor's office should that happen because it has happened quite frequently in Arizona\nAnd I would say that my time in the legislature the eight years I've spent in the trenches on really important issues economic development K. twelve and university education a

think about that aspect of it the fact that you lose the second in command of mustard as opposed to ... some of the responsibility of the actual offers balance that out what what are your thoughts on why I think\nI think obviously someone who's qualified and ready to take on the challenges and the secretary of state's office and make sure there are elections are run and that that we are I'm paying attention to security fairness and efficiency there are but also someone who can who can and who can lead and and I think it's it's a leader that's needed in both roles\nSo where do you stand on a couple of things are much effect you know governor if you were to be sued let's talk about what it comes to taxes are relates to higher education ... per se but trust fund in ...\nWell we're not doing a lot to solve that problem you've got a governor do you see over here you got the education community over here and some other folks over here and nobody\nWilling to sit down at the table and you know I think that the teachers want it to sit down at the table and and we saw the governor talked to some select teachers and not the group and so I think we're not going to solve this problem in a
