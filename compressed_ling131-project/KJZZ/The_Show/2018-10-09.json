[laughter]\nRight and there are some real environmental effects of this like we can talk about the number is a lot but what would this look like I did and the fact that it would be hotter here like what kind of environmental effects with me the\nWell we were comparing one and a half degrees and two degrees and two degrees which is I'm not even as warm as a we might be looking at\nYou can have increase in heat waves and heat stress um heat related deaths and in fact bone diseases associated with mosquitoes\nThat will be loss of biodiversity at two degrees we think the tropical coral reefs will be gone as it gets warmer it'll have increasingly serious implications pull through security I'm One of the things we found is that if you can limit\nA woman to one point five rather than high uh you could reduce the protections\nBoeing diseases associated with mosquitoes\nThat will be lost by diversity at two degrees we think the tropical coral reefs will be gone as it gets warmer it'll have increasingly serious implications for food security I'm One of the things we found is that if you can limit\nAh Wilmington one point five rather than high or you could reduce the protections of water scarcity by Hoff\nSo all of those uh indications that everything we can do to keep it a little bit to la will avoid a lot of losses\nYeah so so you say to prevent this do you point seven degrees of warming greenhouse pollution must be reduced by forty five percent from twenty ten levels by twenty thirty one hundred percent by twenty fifty those ... you say are possible but uh even in the airport you admit this is politically unlikely that right\nUm what we say that's possible but those I'm only a limited number of scenarios all sort of future pause that allow this to be possible and not just a political bar is that our technological barrios there all the have your barrios\nTo us being able to make such deep emission reductions\nSo one thing we do look at it in the report is if we can reduce fossil fuel emissions really steeply\nThan we have to look at some other solutions one of those would be re far station because trees can take up some of the gases yeah but the other new technologies like carbon capture and storage that suck greenhouse gases out of that\nBut then not ready at scale yet they would have to kick in a little bit later yeah\nAnd then the one other thing that we consider is supposing we can't cut things fast enough we might have to accept what we call over shoot whether temperatures would get warmer for a while before coming down\nSays yeah but the other new technologies like carbon capture and storage that suck greenhouse gases out of the ... but then not ready at scale yet they would have to kick him a little bit later yeah\nAnd then the one other thing that we consider is surprising we can't cut things fast enough we might have to accept what we call over shoot where the temperatures would get warmer for a while before coming down\n... and and just some of this have to do with the massive cost that would be associated with some of the solutions but there's also a cost of the damage of this right\nExactly and one of the things we look at in the report a balancing the damages on some of the things it's hard to put a price on like what price did we put on losing coral reefs forever\nAnd we need to contrast that with the levels investment that would be required to transition to well to the top ... carbon dioxide out of our economy but we make some estimates they\nThey all hide that trip in the trillions of dollars bought that are very small percentage of our gross domestic product so\nTheir full double but they require\n'em some pretty serious decisions to put money into research innovation changes and infrastructure and so um yeah ... ... the\nLikelihood of of those massive changes being made quickly is pretty unlikely you think\n[noise] I don't want to be that pessimistic coming what we do without PCC is we lay out choices and then it's up to governments and citizens to decide which of those choices we want to make so we're saying you can do this intimate Wyoming\nOr you can do this and warming will be ... and then you'll have to figure out how to cope with the damages or adapt to living in a high temperature so what we try to do is to lay out some pause ways\nAnd hope that that will then in ...\nThe two governments and citizens to decide which of those choices we want to make so it was saying you can do this and limit ...\nOr you can do this on warming will be ... and then you'll have to figure out how to cope with the damages or adapt to living in a high temperature so what we've tried to do is to lay out some ... ways\nAnd hope that that was an informed decision making and they're all um parts of the world and uh for example California is making some decisions that would be in line with some of the recommendations in the report\nYeah so I mean all the headlines about that have been about how dire the the the consequences could be and this seems very Graham\nIs there a sense I Wonder among scientists like you that we've been talking about this for more than a decade now we've\nWe've made this announcement many times that this will be dire if we don't do anything if we don't do this this will happen do you feel like no one's heating those warnings word that in that time there have been some real significant changes and progress made\nI think the Huston changes I think um\nSome people have been listening individuals' of change that behavior states of change their behavior on countries have started to transition away from fossil fuels and protect the forest so\nThe ... the the cubs is tightening I think the question is is it turning fast enough to keep us on the\nAny sort of serious level of warming but they're all you know there are positive signs and it's just we really need to do use everything in our portfolio at this time if we want to keep warming under one half degrees\nSo I guess in reality the the situation will probably end up somewhere in the middle right somewhere between not doing anything and and doing enough sense so much as as a needed um what do you think at realistically will probably be\nIn Arizona is three public universities are among the colleges and government agencies taking part in a new research project the plan is to develop an information system that connects residence and first responders during a flood with up to the minute localized information the national Science Foundation just awarded the effort or one and a half million dollar grant\nWith me to talk about the project is Ben ... an associate professor in in a youth school of infer medics computing and cyber systems he's been working on this research and then how do you go about actually trying to make this happen\nWell we already have a National Weather service that does a great job at flood forecasting and predicting whether and so they have models and information that comes into their forecasting offices are that are scattered all around the country\nSo we don't need to replicate that but what the National Weather system does is it focuses on larger rivers and on regions\nAnd so what we need to do is bring that down to the scale of your own backyard or we need to look at the streams and washes also retention basins and street of flooding right and your own neighborhood or where you work\nAnd so what we're going to do is start collecting that information using a variety of different technologies some of those technologies include smartphones taking pictures and observations using your phone and sending those in\nYeah so they got pummeled again I'm almost two years to the day um which\nWas just horrible because when I was there in July you would still see all of this destruction but I was talking to a lot of people who are finally getting their lives back together um one woman I saw her the day that she got into her new home that was just rebuilt\nAnd then Florence head and the same thing happens all over again her houses was flooded and I heard that story time and time again\nAnd are there any people or groups in particular that these residents would like to see more from I'm Wondering about FEMA um or any other organizations FEMA has\nBeen on the ground Red Cross has been on the ground there was an issue with Hurricane Matthew with HUD money with housing and urban development money that hadn't come through from the state\nI think about ten percent of the money that was gifted from the federal government was actually distributed so people are saying well okay the money hasn't calm that time around then and that's two years later so what's going to happen with Hurricane Florence money um how how is that going to work\nChris Howard the lumberjack resident we heard from\nWith HUD money with housing and urban development money that hadn't come through from the state\nI think about ten percent of the money that was gifted from the federal government was actually distributed so people are saying well okay the money hasn't come that time around then and that's two years later so what's going to happen with Hurricane Florence money um how how is that going to work\nSo Chris Howard the lumberjack resident we heard from earlier echoed those same concerns in trying to get help rebuilding his house\nAbout is the fifth of what the legislative now just getting medication stage which\nWe don't know what was going to happen because they're telling me that they do for for error they scratched default match\nI talked to many residents that one either or to discourage to even apply for aid because they were told that they would never get it denials are very frequent FEMA admits that and they say you just have to apply again but that's really discouraging to residents\nOne person that I spend a lot of time with the sand Powell she actually went back and forth with FEMA twelve different times talking to different\nRepresentatives having to tell her story again hearing conflicting things you need this piece of information you need this to the point where she just gave up on that process so the recovery for a lot of people that need it the most\nNow we're really hit badly and are in shelters are staying with family members the system isn't really working from them and the way that it's meant to me\nIs a district that was reliably democratic but did end up voting for President Trump who has said as we mentioned earlier that the war on poverty is over is that a disconnect for the residents of Lumberton also at the time\nReally hit badly and are in shelters are staying with family members the system isn't really working from them and the way that it's meant to\nThis is a district that was reliably democratic but did end up voting for President Trump who has said as we mentioned earlier that the war on poverty is over is that a disconnect for the residents of Lumberton also at the time\nBut it was very interesting as I said before just showing up matters and during the hurricane a lot of the people I talked to said we saw Donald Trump's bus we saw the big name Trump on the side of the bus we saw Lara Trump\nPassing out water bottles to us and that was really memorable and we didn't see Hillary Clinton and\nDonald Trump also was kind of talking to the points that really resonated with Robin ... such as I'm going to get rid of NAFTA a lot of people say took a ton of them and you factoring jobs out of the county um I'm not sure\nHow much they think that he's held up their promises but at the time he seemed to be speaking right to them\nAnd where does Lumberton go from here obviously there are mid term elections coming up in a couple of weeks though there's probably still a lot more recovery to be done where do they go from here\nYeah so that's something I was trying to piece together when I was there because you still have hundreds of people in shelters and maybe voting is the last thing on their minds are they weren't really politically engaged to begin with that is one of the reasons we chose rotten county they have a very low turnout rate\nYou're trying to rebuild you may not be living in your house you maybe with a family member\nSo board of elections are saying well we can send you an absentee ballot you can vote from anywhere we're sending them to shelters we've extended their voter registration date by three days\nBut people are that I talked to are saying well I don't know if these measures\nThe very low turnout rate you're trying to rebuild a you may not be living in your house you maybe with a family member\nSo board of elections are saying well we can send you an absentee ballot you can vote from anywhere we're sending them to shelters extended\nTheir voter registration date by three days but people are that I talked to are saying well I don't know if these measures are enough so it'll be interesting to see who does come out for this election if they're if they're angry enough with\nBeing hit twice in two years and don't feel like they've been paid attention to is that if that will matter or if again they're just going to be struggling to stay afloat\nActually both of his act as a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity Ashley thanks for being with us thanks so much for having me and that's ... what the take away\n[noise]\nIt's not hard to come up with the name of someone who's given a lot of money to a particular costs Michael Bloomberg the Koch brothers and Thomas tire among the most prominent but philanthropy is having a bigger impact on public policy and society than that\nDavid Callahan writes about this in his book the givers wealth power and philanthropy in the new gilded age Callahan is the founder and editor of inside philanthropy and joins me via Skype and David I just mentioned some of the most well known donors but I assume it's much bigger pool than just that right absolutely\nWe hear all the time about donors like George Soros and the Koch brothers are Michael Bloomberg or Bill Gates but below goes billionaire mega givers there's a whole bunch of Americans wealthy Americans who are stepping up their philanthropy\nWhat are some of the issues that tend to get particularly big donations\nJust that right absolutely we hear all the time about donors like George Soros and the Koch brothers are Michael Bloomberg our Bill Gates but below those billionaire mega givers there's a whole bunch of Americans wealthy Americans who are stepping up their philanthropy\nSo what are some of the issues that tend to get particularly big donations were or a large number of of large donations\nA great example from recent years of the power of philanthropy has been the algae Beatty rights movement that there is a group of wealthy donors who decided back almost Twenty years ago that hey we really want to see marriage equality happen in this country and they worked over\nA long period they gave a lot of money to a activist\nOrganizations legal groups think tanks you in a match and that goal was achieved in two thousand Fifteen and another example is climate change we see a lot of\nBillionaires who are really worried about the\nIssue of climate change and have given enormous amounts of money to reduce greenhouse gases Michael Bloomberg is a great example of that Tom stiers another billionaire made his fortune in hedge funds who's been given a lot of money to deal with the threat of climate change\nIt seems like a lot of times people who give these big donations to particular causes you just mentioned Michael Bloomberg ... talked about the Koch brothers and George Soros they kinda become like Boogie Man politically I'm Wondering if donors think about that either before giving or maybe be forgiving publicly\nAbsolutely they do a lot of these wealthy donors understand that if they give big donations to political causes they could become a target and many of them as a result to try to cover their tracks\nTo become like bogeyman politically I'm Wondering if donors think about that either before giving or maybe be forgiving publicly\nAbsolutely they do a lot of these wealthy donors understand that if they give big donations to political causes they could become a target and many of them as a result to try to cover their tracks a and there's more of that kind of shadow giving that is happening how closely\nDo these donors track the success of the particular issues to which they're donating\nMany do very closely track the impact of their money other donors are a little more hands off but for sure I mean remember these are people who made their money\nThrough great success in business right that they know how to run large companies they know how to get results and\nThey're turning to fled their pay with that kind of real management capability\nAnd good metrics is definitely part of that\nI'm Wondering if there's an element for at least some donors that\nThey think that maybe they can do better what government has been doing I mean I'm thinking about people like\nEven on Mars crew has basically his company is doing what NASA be used to do is they're sort of an element of that may be trying to make government more efficient or maybe even take the place of government based on on their donations\nThere certainly is an element of that and the larger picture here is that we live in an era where government has diminished resources it has\nA often less capacity to solve problems and so you see government kind of pulling out of the leadership role in some key places space being one of them space exploration government\nHas a lot of strength but taking risks\nThere certainly is an element of that and the larger picture here is that we live in an era where government has diminished resources it has\nA often less capacity to solve problems and so you see government kind of pulling out of the leadership role in some key places space being one of them space exploration government\nHas a lot of strength but taking risks experimenting trying new things this is often not one of the great strengths of government and philanthropists\nOften see themselves as hey you know let me do a bunch of stuff that government isn't doing or can't do and hopefully move the needle that way many of these philanthropist that should be said would love to have government eventually embrace their ideas because they understand that that's where the money is\nDo you think the government has become more dependent on these kinds of donations or maybe particular causes have gotten more dependent on these big donations as opposed to sort of a a big grassroots\nEffort at smaller dollar amounts\nWell yes keep in mind that the bigger picture here is that ordinary Americans had been giving less money to charity and there's a reason for that most people have not seen any real income gains for decades in this country meanwhile most of the gains in our economy had gone to the top one percent\nThose are the people who have extra money lie around to invest in nonprofits and end charitable causes\nWondering how you reconcile that with what we saw for example during the twenty sixteen Democratic primary when someone like Bernie Sanders was bragging about sort of a\nAnd end charitable causes\nI'm Wondering how you reconcile that with what we saw for example during the twenty sixteen Democratic primary when someone like Bernie Sanders was

with what we're seeing here do you think both parts of this measure are designed to do that\nI absolutely think it's part of this pattern we've seen in the last Twenty years since the voters created

system there's been a chipping away at clean elections for a long time over the course of Twenty years so with what we're seeing your do you think both parts of this measure are designed to do

with a system that was really the voters taking some power back in in terms of how their their status run\n'em and you know I I I understand the idea um that some some folks were upset with the\nThe rule the clean elections you know settled on and twenty Seventeen which again I think brings a lot more transparency\nTo the process than we have before but I think the real question for voters is you know even if if you're not perfectly happy with that is it is that worth allowing more dark money into the system which is really the the bigger impact here you know we're talking about millions of dollars being spent and clean elections is really the only institution we have as a state\nThat's been trying to to shine a light on that\nMoney jumping into the bigger question for me would you because I Know a lot of people as you mentioned past fifty point one percent you both come back and forth as to what we voters knew this about clean elections what would they have done but is there a feeling of let's just chip away at this again it's it's a fairly weekend many people would say it's been defined at this point anyway\nWell I personally don't support the idea of giving money to candidates to pay for their junk mail and yard signs I I I Would just flat out say that out on my own that's my own personal point of view but this ballot measure it doesn't do that\nThis ballot measure allows the current system to be in place that's in statute that was voted on by the people you can still receive twenty five thousand dollars for ...\nTwo hundred and five dollar checks and all those same rules still still are put in place that was what people voted for they didn't vote for another elections police they didn't vote for the idea of giving them money to political parties

police they didn't vote for the idea of giving that money to political parties they didn't vote for any of that that what they need to understand it is it is then it has morphed into something that it was not originally intended to be\nI was there a while all these debates were happening I remember running for office at the time and it is not what the the frame or said it would be and I think that that is simply because clean elections chose to make its own rules as it went along\nThink about any other part of government has some kind of accountability on this is an institution that has the power to find new it has the power to remove people from office it can remove the governor from office if it feels that it violates its own rules my response is why would you allow them just to simply create their own rules out of whole cloth\nWell then why would it make sense than to have a a council appointed by governor Republican or Democrat there's going to be certainly a swing there why is that a better option well\nI think that if you look at and we use the people certainly get to choose our representatives we vote on them there's there's accountability there but they don't have unfair to power once they are elected they they have to there's an interplay with the other branches of government clean election should not be ... exempted from any legislative or executive oversight\nThat that is or not the way our system of checks and balances operates keep in mind they just created this rule on their own\nAnd they can remove you as a as an elected official on their own no there's no there's no other process put in place like you see in the legislature or in the executive branch that norm is amounts of power that they have and I don't think they should have more power to continue to create their own ... rules which are essentially last June\nOf checks and balances operates keep in mind they just created this rule on their own\nAnd they can remove you as a as an elected official on their own no there's no there's no other process put in place like you see in the legislature or in the executive branch that norm is amounts of power that they have and I don't think they should have more power to continue to create their own ... rules which are essentially loss Joe\nSo I I just want to push back on a ... a couple of the points there I think one is that the voters did intend to create a new watchdog that was not a bunch of politicians of the state capital who otherwise are the ones who set rules for\nPoliticians right and the groups that spend money to either elect them were opposed them you know the idea was to have an independent bipartisan nonpartisan kind of a watchdog um to to make the rules\nThat the the last piece though on you know clean elections can kind of make whatever rules they want what they look to follow the law right they have\nThe authority of the voters gave them and that's the extent of their authority they can't just sort of make up rules willy nilly that are not tethered\nTo the authority that they are given and there's the whole system of checks and balances through the courts and and and trust me they got plenty of scrutiny from the legislature 'em\nAnd other elected officials so it the idea that there is some kind of you know there are there off on their their own agenda you know their agenda it often does conflict with elected officials because their agenda is is transparency in is holding\nThe will of the voters Jonathan paid and Joel Evan thank you thank you thank you\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]
