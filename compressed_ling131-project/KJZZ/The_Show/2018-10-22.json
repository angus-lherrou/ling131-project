continues to make even as a former sheriff fault zone joined me in Studio earlier and I started our conversation by asking him what he's done to change the culture of his office and improve community relations\nYou know I I think there's a parallel you know we can talk about those separately that the culture inside in the relationship outside but they have to go just you know in culture is a tough word to define a you know for every one it it means something different a lot of it is this perception but at the end of the day what do you want from law enforcement\nYou want to ensure that the professional in their practices that they're respectful to the power that we possess as well as those that we serve\nIn that every day we have that the level of dedication where it is our commitment to not only keep you safe but to thoroughly investigate crimes that adverse effects you\nKnow in theory those are simplistic things in in ... in in practicalities are very complex but as a community if you know that your law enforcement agency is executing in that manner\nI Would imagine that already instills trust and confidence in itself in in ... than they are\nUm reciprocal [noise] you know the the communities confidence or trust in you helps you rise to the occasion and vice versa the fact that you have that kind of commitment helps a community be more comfortable and supportive of the effort because at the end of the day we know one thing to be true\nLaw enforcement is a very dangerous difficult profession\nSo they're the human element means that we will make mistakes and we will have errors we just try to minimize those in at the same time ensure that they are things outside of our control versus self inflicted or malice actions because that is the number one thing as the\nHead of an organization that you cannot tolerate and his malice or a um inappropriate unlawful actions now that being said how much of that is training in how much of that is hiring the right people I think it's a balance but to you know we can train you know all day long but if if either\nAnd at the same time ensure that they are things outside of our control versus self inflicted or malice actions because that is the number one thing as the\nHead of an organization that you cannot tolerate and his malice or a um inappropriate unlawful actions now that being said how much of that is training and how much of that is hiring the right people I think it's a balance but to you know we can train you know all day long but if if either you lock the skill set or the commitment\nTo it here in executed properly then doesn't matter what we did we can change you and at the same time for some lacking the training they don't know if they don't know therefore they can't be successful so I have to\nHire people that are best qualified\nHold them accountable to train them appropriately and to make sure that we constantly revisit that 'cause it's not a one time training things over time everything evolves switch to reinforce messages and we have to support those efforts to put you in a position to succeed as a law enforcement professionals a deputy news organization or detention officer\nAnd then ensure that the community has confidence in it that rewards\nAs what people wanting to pursue a career with us and now one big issue you had to deal with your predecessor did as well is the relationship with the federal government as it relates to ice in particular the immigration issue very emotional we're hearing about it a lot from the deejay somebody that effects are us on as a border state\nWhere's your office at in terms of dealing with ice when it comes to holding on to folks when it comes to dealing with what to do next with undocumented immigrants who come to Arizona\nYou know first thing that you mentioned this I Believe is as well you referencing is [noise] weren't into federal court order show I inherited a debt knowingly\nI didn't feel as though the that was being paid appropriately low on behalf of the best interest of the community because it comes it costs the taxpayer dollars as well as law enforcement resources if you're not abiding by those rules and doing everything you can get out from underneath that oversight in a lawful way so\nMentioned this I Believe this is what you're referencing as we're into federal court order so I inherited a debt knowingly\nI didn't feel as though the debt was being paid appropriately on behalf of the best interest of the community because it comes it costs of taxpayer dollars as well as law enforcement resources if you're not abiding by those rules and doing everything you can get out from underneath that oversight in a lawful way\nSo in that aspect of it we've made great gains in the in the year and a half or so we've gone from about Fifteen Percent compliance upwards of eighty five percent once week see Ninety four the clock will begin to tick off so we are getting really close to that and I'm hopeful in the next quarter to that will see that the other side of immigration is complex\nThe law enforcement side of his window someone break the law and then in addition to that they are in the country unlawfully\nWe have zero and I mean everybody to pay attention as we have zero authority to be involved in immigration enforcement the federal court orders prohibit that from occurring so my office cannot in any way shape or form asks him one of their status\nIf we were in violation of court orders and that is contempt of court when I took the office we had more called courtesy old and and we talked about a few times which is for clarification\nCourtesy holes were to minister to fold not lawful Holdren measure to hold keeping someone and detention longer than it is lawful we had to stop that because we were being sued in is a violation of the Fourth Amendment so I stopped that practice but at the same time\nFrom [noise]\nFronteras desk reporting on cage as easy as made possible

what she thought she could do and she says she's more comfortable as a musician\nI started off our conversation by asking her about the meaning of the bands name calling junk\nSo if you look it up online it's like to direct translation his colleague if you talk to a person who is in like an native polish speaker it sort of means more like\nA friend that you kind of hang out with their maybe get

good morning Steve\nSo this is a I'm a big concept but can you explain to us what's psychic numbing means\nYes a psychic numbing is reflects the inability of our feelings to uh to scale up when a problem or is large and affects a lot of lot of people and in contrast to the fact that we can react we react very strongly\nWhen one individual a is a at risk or has been harmed so are are are are feeling system is is geared to focus on an individual and it doesn't do math very well\nIs it somehow more relayed all this feeling that perhaps we can imagine it happening to ourselves as individuals or someone whom are very close as opposed to hundreds or thousands of people\nWell it certainly uh ... it's hard to hard to grasp grasped something that's affecting hundreds of thousands of people like the family and that is taking place in Yemen now due to the war that we're supporting the Saudis and where uh where millions are facing starving\nIt happening to ourselves as individuals or

someone once said that there's\nA statistics are human beings with the tears dried off you don't you don't see they feel the reality of what's underneath the surface of those statistics but when you're talking about an individual you know and especially one that is so prominent\nAs a show gay was and you see the you know you see films of him and said fills a film of him walking\nOr you know into the consulate you know to be killed even I mean you can relate to that you see it it's a vivid image and that creates a powerful reaction is\nOne of the committee to protect journalists is reporting that more than forty journalists worldwide have already been killed this year and that includes pneumonia show as well so when we're thinking about that the fact that the other people have not gotten more attention does that give you an insight just as to why\nWell on this ... this particular incident is is very dramatic and in many many ways and so uh you know it it deserved it deserves the coverage\nOf that it's had so um you know the fact that other people are are threatened again if there are multiple people threatened and ... you know okay that's again the multiple people we ... we find that that uh we begin to lose focus and attention when there's more than one when it becomes two or three or four\nYou know we start to kind of lose it uh and so if there's a lot of people and you know nothing specifically if they have happened\nKnow the fact that other people are are threatened again if there are multiple people threatened and ... yeah okay that's again the multiple people we ... we find that that uh we begin to lose focus and attention when there's more than one when it becomes two or three or four\nYou know we start to kind of lose it uh and so if

make of where your hospital ranked in that report\nWill the Phoenix so writing was was certainly not what we would have hoped but I think it's important to understand what goes into that sale rating

into that Sal rating and also the work behind it and what's happening now\nThis metrics include a number of performance measures things like how the hospital is doing in preventing illness both on an inpatient outpatient basis they also included patient perception metrics and complications and so forth [noise]\nIf you look at for instance our performance metrics Phoenix ranked number Nineteen in the country when you look at what are called heat is in ... metrics these are kind of standard\nMetrics used in health care to understand\nThe quality of care being provided so ranking number nineteenth in quality is very different from being what people think of as being the one star facility what's hard is that also a part of that star rating twenty seven percent of the waiting is patient perception\nThe fact that those metrics weight perception so heavily as something that is going to be a recurring problem for Phoenix if we look only at sale as a measure of how we're doing\nLet's talk about some of the areas of improvement because in the cell reading Phoenix is basically at the same level as it was last year which was again a water out of out of five so in what areas do you think the Phoenix VA has improved\nWell I Would say first and foremost is the quality of care is measured in what I was talking about before they hit us in works measures that has been a major improvement people have pulled together in a way to ensure our veterans are receiving the best possible carry impatient and outpatient\nThere are other ways that we've improved as well we have improved on access but it's just not captured in the metrics we treat over Ninety three thousand veterans a year last fiscal year so that's October one till September thirtieth we provided over one point five million encounters for patients\nWere not perfect at what we do we're always\nReceiving the best possible care impatient and outpatient\nAre other ways that we've improved as well we have improved on access but it's just not captured in the metrics we treat over Ninety three thousand veterans a year last fiscal year so that's October one till September thirtieth we provided over one point five million encounters for patients\nWere not perfect at what we do we're always looking at ways to improve the veterans are voting with their feet and coming to us for care we've done a lot of things to streamline access to care we've expanded tele health services in a big way and that's convenient many of our patients have really bought into that\nSo with all of those improvements I mean how far along to where you would think you need to be are you I mean if it sounds like you don't think the the one out of five reading is a is a fair or representative radium and how would you rate where you are now\nWell first of all I I might be a little bit prejudice working within the system I'm incredibly proud of our employees and the work they're doing\nThey have really buckle down and and dug in looked at quality and not star rating and that's where our changes are and actually that's what I measure as the most important thing for us how we're doing overall and quality we feel like the stars will line later but will always be impacted by that metric related to um perception\nLet me ask you about the perception issue though because I I Want to clarify that I Want to make sure 'cause it almost sounds like you're saying that the hospital's main problem now is perception I Want to make is that the keys or their actual\nPractices techniques issues within the hospital that actually are problems or are still not where you want them to be that would have to get further irrespective of of what your patients think of them\nSo let me clear that up I think the challenge for us on the sale magic and the star rating that's uppermost is our perception metrics in terms of what's going on in the hospital\nAre their actual practices techniques issues within the hospital that actually are problems or are still not where you want them to be that would have to get further irrespective of of what your patients think of them\nSo let me cleared that up I think the challenge for us on the cell magic and the star rating that's uppermost is our perception metrics\nIn terms of what's going on in the hospital I I'm happy to say we're not perfect were about what we can do better were always saying to our staff we can't fix it we don't know about and we share that with patients I'm and review complaints as an opportunity and are very grateful when they come our way\nThat said we know that for instance our building is built for thirty thousand veterans not Ninety three thousand it was built in the late Nineteen forties early Nineteen fifty when patients were typically kept in four bedrooms and three bedrooms and\nSo forth that's not the standard of care in the community and what we need to do is take an old building and make it\nA safe and comfortable for patients and um we also know that crowded rooms which can potentially contribute to patient falls in as much as every hospital tries to prevent infection\nHaving multiple people in one room and it's also a concern there so we're undertaking initiative to move to single patient rooms although that will take a little bit of time\nYou reference that you're telling your staff that you can't fix the problems you don't know about I'm curious how confident you are that you are aware of all are so majority of the problems that are that exist in the Phoenix to be a no\nWell that's a wonderful question and especially in Phoenix where we had situations with whistle blowers in the past\nWe've done a lot of things to try and empower our staff to bring forward concerned so I have friday morning drop in ours

their concerns are addressed immediately some of them take kind of projects or group worker systems to be addressed but we do hear a lot but I'm sure we don't hear everything just like we don't hear
