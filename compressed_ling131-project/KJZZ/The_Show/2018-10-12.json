being not enough to write one woman wrote that she was using pads and then eventually resorted to using a wash rag for several days because they had run out of toilet paper have you found out or if you heard what the cause of the shortage supposedly is\nI asked the Arizona department of corrections they responded saying that the allegations were patently untrue they say the ... tour this specific unit this week and things were find plenty of TV\nBut they also told me in the same response that there had been a shortage last month but they blamed it on the women abusing the system and you may remember when I covered the hearing in the legislature earlier this year representative athena Solomon introduced a bill\nThat would have given female inmates unlimited access to feminine hygiene products and toilet paper but it was blocked by house leadership one of the things that all the male committee members brought up was this potential for misuse that if you you know you give them unlimited supplies the abuse it so I just want to recognize that we're also a group of men\nTalking about women's hygiene issues so representative Solomon is going to remind us of something that I think a lot of men take for granted\nUnderstand that for women every single time you go to the restroom you need toilet paper and I can tell you from personal experience when I stepped into a stall

basic think many in basic respect we really think that when they go back into society they're going to be okay and they're going to be fine like we're deluding ourselves and to me this is completely unacceptable\nWhile ABC denied this was happening Solomon actually confirmed the shortages with the governor's office\nWho told her it was due to the very changes she had brought about earlier in the years Solomon was successful in getting a DC to change their internal policy to increase the amount of pads and tampons in March ADC told me that they also increase the toilet paper rationing at that

internal election clocks ticking away you know mine is of course mine never stops\nAnyway it also means for two years out from the twenty sixteen campaign if you can believe that when then candidate Donald Trump ran on a series of promises to the American people\nTell the president of course isn't on the ballot this year but I mean the term election is kind of like those mid term tests you took back in school there the first real assessment of all you've done in class for the first part of the semester\nAnd they're supposed to get you ready for the big one final\nVoters use the midterm elections to send a message to the president they take a look back at the last two years and greatest the more unhappy they are with the president is the more likely they vote against members of his party in November\nThey're happy with him they support the members of his party\nOne way voters evaluate how a president is doing this to look at whether he's filled the promises he made as a candidate but we also know voters evaluate the president on more than just policy they look at things like leadership temperament comports himself in the job\nBut today's episode will specifically look at what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail and whether he's comes through on those commitments\nAnd there's a lot to get into\nEvaluate our president is doing this to look at whether he's filled the promises he made as a candidate but we also do voters evaluate the president on more than just policy they look at things like leadership temperament comports himself in the job\nBut today's episode will specifically look at what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail and whether he's\nComes through on those commitments\nAnd there's a lot to get into [noise]\n\nWe begin with foreign policy\nSo I Do believe that Trump has had an extremely consequential foreign policy presidency so far in ways that are often under rated by the way both by critics of his and buy some orders\nThat Susan Glasser staff writer for the New Yorker\nHe has almost singlehandedly because even his own party largely does not support much of this agenda on foreign policy in particular\nHe is more or less singlehandedly\nReorientate American foreign policy seems to me away from me rules based or values based foreign policy and towards an extremely transactional unilateral view of the United states in the world a much more Machiavellian great powers\nThe might rule the strong do as they will kind of view of the world\nPresident Trump brand on a few key promises when it comes to foreign policy one and the most important in all real dealings he'd put America First\nUs had become too attached a multinational relationships and deals that weren't directly benefiting the U.S he also insisted that under his leadership the world would respect us again an idea premised on the false notion that the world did not respect the United states before\nWe are going to do something so good at so fast and so strong and the world is going to respect us again believe me\nProbably his biggest failure by the numbers\nDeals that weren't directly benefiting the U.S he also insisted that under his leadership the world would respect us again an idea premised on the false notion that the world did not respect the United states before\nWe are going to do something so good at so fast and so strong and the world is going to respect us again believe me\nThis is probably his biggest failure by the numbers\nBy any objective standard the United states has plummeted in\nWorld opinion there are only a couple of countries in the entire world according to the Pew global attitudes survey which is the leading kind of nonpartisan independent survey of countries around the world and how they view the United states and other world leaders only in Russia\nIsrael and possibly one or two other countries\nIs the standing of the United states better now than it was before Trump took office and not only that it it's reversed dramatically you actually have in Germany right now\nMore people saying they trust Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping to do the right thing on the world stage than Donald Trump that something extremely unprecedented for an American leader even an unpopular one like George W\nTrump also promised to withdraw from multilateral deals like the Iran nuclear deal my number one\nPriority is to dismantle the disasters whether at what we\nPresident Trump on foreign policy I Would argue is very much of a blow things up approach\nIt's much harder to make new deals or to create a new world order or to reorient American foreign policy\nThan it is to criticize and withdraw from a existing arrangement in particular I Would say that applies to the Iran deal so we are we with Iran\nI Would argue is very much of a blow things up approach\nIt's much harder to make new deals or to create a new world order or to reorient American foreign policy than it is to criticize and then withdraw from a existing arrangements in particular I Would say that applies to the Iran deal\nSo we are we with around now because Europe has said we're still in the deal there living up to the uh rules that we set for them so is the U.S just kind of going it alone\nThen yes a number one the US's going it alone for now this was a deal made between Iran and the world's sixth leading major powers so that also included Russia and China as well as Germany France the u._k.\nAll of them have committed to ... I mean within the deal\nThere is a new deadline that will expose I think the fault lines between America's closest allies in Europe and the United states on this issue\nComing up right before the election on November fourth that's when the automatic\nVery serious sanctions against anyone doing business with Iran are supposed to kick back in a and so basically there's a big lobbying campaign right now pressure campaign to get European countries to pull out of doing business with Iran as a consequence of this\nEuropean talking tough but it doesn't really have the infrastructure set up a to protect them from the effects of us sanctions so they are largely expected\nTo comply with this move on Trump's part however the absence of a J. C. P. A. that was the you know your credit acronym for the Iran deal the absence of that does not mean the existence of a proactive new strategy and so\nYou know it's really hard to say and on Russia\nI don't know who should nice things about me if we got along well that would be good if Russia and the ...\nTo comply with this move on Trump's part however the absence of Jaycee Pew and that was the you know your credit acronym for the Iran deal the absence of that does not mean the existence of a proactive new strategy and so you know it's really hard to say and on Russia\nI don't know who he said nice things about me if we got along well that would be good if Russia and the United states got along well and went after ISIS that would be good\nI Would say that the Trump Administration policy toward Russia is actually\nA more hawkish or muscular\nContinuation of the second term\nPosts twenty fourteen Obama administration policy toward Russia I eat after Russia invaded uh its neighbor you crave\nA illegally annexed Crimea and uh has generally had a much more aggressive foreign policy outside its borders we've responded with sanctions by increasing the military presence of NATO troops including American troops\nIn Eastern Europe and in those countries that border Russia and a increasing pressure in every way on Russia isolating it ... this is essentially the policy view and it's it's largely uncontroversial right more or less supported by Republicans and\nSo it is really following a precedent and this issue came up because in Chinese sixteen the city council decided that they no longer had to follow the precedent that every major decision went to a vote of the people\nHow much of this is about desert edge\nIt started about dessert edge\nBut what that really exposed getting back to your earlier question was what was the role of government because to put the editor edged sword everyone expected that there would be a public vote again because every major decision in the preserve and really every major capital projects in Scottsdale has gone before the citizens\nSuddenly city council saying oh no we can build whatever we want spend whatever we want out of the preserve fun by simple majority of four and that exposed\nA loophole in the city charter and that is what proposition for twenty has really intended to do simply close that loophole and clarify that any development decisions need to go before the citizens no and reading through thirty some odd pages of arguments for and against this and the city's publicity pamphlet\nIt seems like one of the concerns that opponents have put forward is that this could\nAnd that exposed a loophole in the city charter and that is what proposition for twenty has really intended to do simply close that loophole and classify that any development decisions need to go before the citizens no in reading through thirty some odd pages of arguments for and against this and the city's publicity pamphlet\nIt seems like one of the concerns that opponents have put forward is that this could set a precedent for not only projects in the preserve but for other municipal type projects that\nInstead of the elected leaders being able to decide what can and can't happen more things would have to go to a vote of the people tell me while you're not concerned about that [noise]\nThere were two years and really going back even further probably going back to two thousand aid\nFrom Wendy first large scale commercial development edge attainment center was proposed that citizens began discussing and organizing to demand devote over this project\nIt took three hundred volunteers six months hitting the streets to collect thirty seven thousand six hundred and eight signatures of their fellow citizens one in three voters in Scottsdale signed a petition\nThere is absolutely no issue in the city of Scottsdale that will ever compared to this but in terms of other projects that normally a city government might be able to approve or or not approve\nIs there any thinking on your part that\nIf voters approve prop for twenty that the next time there needs to be I don't know a new fire or a police station or some other project in the preserve that that will have to go to a vote of the people I mean how how broader narrowed do you envision this to be\nWell our charter language or charter change is actually extremely narrow if you've read it it's really only about a hundred two hundred words there's two paragraphs the first one says any construction and the preserve other than for trails trail has or maintenance needs to go to a vote or the people and then there's a list of exceptions but it's a really narrow change it\nThat that will have to go to a vote of the people I mean how how broader narrowed you envision this to be\nWell our charter language are charter change is actually extremely narrow if you've read it it's really only about a hundred two hundred words there's two paragraphs the first one says any construction and the preserve other than for trails trail has their maintenance needs to go to a vote of the people and then there's a list of exceptions but it's a really narrow change\nIf voters approve prop for twenty do you think that they would then have a say on desert edge do you think the city would move forward with that project you know if the city thinks it's a good idea and certainly there have been some voices they do think it's a good idea\nBy all means propose it by all means propose a we're not trying to stop the specific project we're simply saying let the citizens vote on it so if that happens\nAnd Scottsdale voters say yes we want this would you be okay with them absolutely this is the people's preserve that people bought at the people tax themselves for it if the people vote to have the desert edge then so be it the key to our whole proposition\nIs we are preventing the precedent for being established that for city council people by simple majority\nCan decide what goes in the one point seven billion dollar preserve\nAnd spend the hundred twenty five million dollar preserved fun by simple voted for politicians\nDo think that if desert edges built it would enhance the preserve do you think you would take away from the preserve what kind of impact I think it would have I think it wouldn't really relate to the preserve because it is a self contained museum\nAnd entertainment center I don't think the idea of per se is bad but I think there are so many better places and better synergy it could have for example the museum of the west is a beautiful facility right in downtown Scottsdale it has\nIncredible integration with the community with the galleries with the restaurants with the stadium why not add a wink to the museum of the west\nIt doesn't have to be a huge investment the building's already there and if it fails the building can be re purpose they're talking about space\nI think there are so many better places and better synergy it could have for example the museum of the west is a beautiful facility right in downtown Scottsdale it has incredible integration with the community with the galleries with the restaurants with the stadium why not add a wink to the museum of the west\nIt doesn't have to be a huge investment the building's already there and if it fails the building can be re purpose they're talking about\nA specific one off facility that has absolutely no other purpose other than to house one project with a questionable revenue stream\nThat's Jason Alexander one of the directors of no D. D. C. which supports proposition for twenty\nWell it's a measure has its share of critics as well Melinda ... is one of them she served on both is gone still McDonald's norm preserved commission ... conservancy and is currently a campaign volunteer for protect your preserve which opposes prop for twenty\nAnd wonder why do you think voters vote no on this\nProposition for twenty is a change to our city charter the city charter is like the constitution for the city of Scottsdale and\nThe proposition on the ballot in November prop for twenty we believe has some unintended consequences that are concerning\nNot only for the governance of Scottsdale but also for the management of the McDonalds and aren't preserve what kinds of unintended consequences do you think this might have well I think that's the first piece is that the charter seeks to empower\nThe Dallas in order to preserve commission to make decisions about what's in the best interest of the preserve today that right and at the worry is vested in the city council and we believe that's the right place for that authority to be vested\nNot to empower the unelected unaccountable group of people\nI used to be one to make decisions about what's appropriate and the preserve the second part of the ...\nCommission to make decisions about what's in the best interest of the preserve today that right and at the worry is vested in the city council and we believe that's the right place for that authority to be vested not to empower the unelected unaccountable group of people\nI used to be one to make decisions about what's appropriate and to preserve the second part of the unintended consequences is that it's unclear what impact\nThis charter amendment will have on the maintenance and restoration of the preserved so for example if we have a major flood event\nIf we have a major fire event or if we have a major drought what kind of improvements for example a watering hole in the case of a drought or fire breaks in the case for wild land fire you know would this city be able to undertake those projects if this proposition passed us\nKnow when you're talking about putting more power in the hands of they're preserved commission the initiative just says that any building basically does not already been approved has to go to a vote of Scott so residents how does that give more power put some of these additional decisions in the hands of of these unelected commissions\nSo the challenge with the proposition is that it empowers the preserved commission to determine what's appropriate in terms of restoration efforts or other improvements in the preserve\nAnd those that word appropriate is to find and I think that leaves U.S Open to all sorts of interpretation which could cause lots of lawsuits and lots of confusion in the future and it would paralyze the city in terms of\nYou know what is in the best interest of the preserve and can they move forward with these projects\nSounds like it might be the same concern you have with the second unintended consequence he referenced in terms of needing to do something maybe a little more quickly in terms of dealing with a ...\nAnd I think that leaves U.S Open to all sorts of interpretation which could cause lots of lawsuits and lots of confusion in the future and it would paralyze the city in terms of\nYou know what is in the best interest of the preserve and can they move forward with these projects\nThat sounds like it might be the same concern you have with the second unintended consequences you referenced in terms of needing to do something maybe a little more quickly in terms of dealing with a flood or a fire or something like that\nNo supporters will say this really doesn't have to do with that kind of thing it's really about building something like desert edge in reserve it sounds like you don't necessarily think it it starts with that\nOh I definitely don't think it starts with that the proposition effort was born out of concern for the long planned nature education center that was approved with these exact uses in two thousand and seven\nHowever the bride nature the overly broad nature of this proposition applies to the entire McDowell is in order to preserve\nIt seems to me that at some level this question is really about what is the role of government that what do we elect in this case mayors and city councils to decide and what should voters ourselves decide do you think that's a fair assessment\nI think that's a fair assessment and I believe in the American system of government in Scottsdale system of government that has elected representation and we have the ability to vote people we support into office and we hold them accountable by either re electing them or not re electing them based on the\nVotes that they've made its cumbersome to do votes of the people for questions even if they're controversial and I'll I'll grant that this has been controversial but I don't think that should motivate us to change our city constitution\nProject itself desert edge used to be called the desert discovery center to defeat\nAnd we hold them accountable by either re electing them or not re electing them based on the\nVotes that they've made its cumbersome to do ... votes of the people for questions even if they're controversial and I'll I'll grant that this has been controversial but I don't think that should motivate us to change our city constitution the project\nItself deserted used to be called the desert discovery center to different iteration that it also has been very very controversial as you reference\nI'm Wondering if sort of at the end of the day do you see where other people are coming from that maybe having a commercial entity are in that spot maybe isn't the best use for that land or maybe sort of\nThat's not the right spot for this kind of development\nSo I Would suggest that the desert edge is not a commercial development the desert discovery center is not a commercial development it's no more commercial\nThan a library the desert botanical garden or a local museum because it has the opportunity to earn revenue does not make it a commercial use it's a municipal years\nIt has been envisioned at the gateway to the mic Dallas and aren't preserves since before that land was acquired\nIf there was another spot in the city\nWe've done multiple sites studies I haven't found that spot but I'm all ears if there is one\nSo if you are successful in an for twenty fails do you think that means that desert edges automatically build\nAbsolutely not [laughter] I think that if for twenty does not pass I think it gives the community the opportunity to work on the plan for the desert edge and get feedback from the community\nI think it should be a modification for generations ... kid scan more as an icon of what we were able to do as a country\nAs part of universe or celebrations will offer conferences in Mexico city and Wyoming Arizona State

I think you're referencing is an outlier in the sense that it's it's as far as ... as far as how large the spread as you know the internal polling has had more in the\nEr at they released in the high single digits um you know things can change and we were three weeks out you know I've I've seen leads evaporate before I'm not saying it's likely but it's possible and then to your point I mean\nWe don't know what the democratic surge is going to be like if there is going to be one I think there will be one but it's more a question of like how big is it and how does it affect things\nRun the risk of doing a a post mortem on a campaign and the candidate before a vote has actually been counted\nThere's been a lot written and discussed about sort of the differences between how David Garcia campaign four years ago when he ran it\nFor a superintendent public construction and cast himself as sort of a moderate and this time when he's been campaigning with a Bernie Sanders and talked about indoor since ... with Warren from a a a democratic perspective had has he changed sort of the the image of where he is sort of on the political spectrum this year relative to four years ago\nWell it's it's not quite apples apples rhyming running for superintendent as it is\nYears ago when he ran for superintendent public construction and cast himself as sort of a moderate and this time when he's been campaigning with a Bernie Sanders and talked about indoor since ... with war and from a a a democratic perspective head has he changed sort of the the image of where he is sort of on the political spectrum this year relative to four years ago\nWell it's it's not quite apples apples rhyming ready for superintendent as a sort of a different role when you're running for governor there's a lot of other issues and then we're also into Europe Donald Trump and I think that sort of changes things as he run more to the left and more progressive than he didn't twenty fourteen I think absolutely I think you look at his policy positions and that has to be the case\nUm but also you know if this theory again is that you want to drive progressive turnout Dr Latino turnout for example that I think a lot of the positions I think are based on that presumption that if you take those positions are going to try those kinds of voters out\nSaid again you can't win a statewide race in Arizona without Republican voters and as Republicans we we're all waiting for David Garcia to pivot ... inch slightly towards the riot and give us something never happened\nYou know another thing about the advertising that struck me as interesting is that do the governor has gotten tremendous amounts of money from I grew I mean independents measure groups he's not connected to but that of supported him or his point of view\nThose have been very very negative for David Garcia but at the governor's own ads are the ones we're seeing a very positive it's almost like morning in America what about the contrast it's it's quite interesting do you think voters can can delineate between those two\nI don't think so I I think when you're watching the commercials it just seems like the same thing you're hearing on the campaign very few people read that fine print at the end of that but I think candidates are very careful to not be saddled with the negative campaigning you know that's that's why you count and hope that they have will come in and do it\nSo big political science philosophy question that I Do the candidates like the the inside and they think for themselves boy I really really wouldn't have done that\nSeems like the same thing you're just hearing from the campaign very few people read that fine print at the end of it but I think candidates are very careful to not be saddled with the negative campaigning you know that's that's why you count and hope that the Iraqis will come in and do it\nSo big political science philosophy question then do the candidates like the I mean the inside or they think for themselves where I really really wouldn't have done that ad but got started I'm really glad they did that for me or do they think that's casting need a strange way to\n... I think the the former ready to leave right before I'm too cynical I don't know but but you know candidates want to win alternately right I mean that's the number one goal um in in you know if they if they can get outside and outside group to do the negative work for them so they're not directly tied to it\nI think that has a great Neal benefit to them or where they can focus on perhaps their issues on the positive you know the the setting the agenda for themselves and not having to go negative that's always a good thing\nYeah yeah absolutely I mean I think you know if you want someone to be able to throw a punch for you said that you don't have to do at yourself and and all these people that embark on this ultimately want to win so it's whatever it takes\nWe've talked about a couple of debates are today let's talk about when that happened this week between the two candidates for attorney general Republican more Vernor Vinge the income and\nAnd the Democratic challenger January ... this is one that seemingly based on the polls and of course who knows any more polls are accurate but the polls have shown us not to be a terribly close race did we learn anything from the AG debate that that was held this week\nWe have we sure did we learned that January ... will not defend Arizona law if she disagrees with it or find it to be unconstitutional she's not going to leave that to the courts to decide she's going to decide and recused herself and have Arizona hire someone else to step in and can you imagine if a sheriff\nDecided to make arrests based on what laws he agreed\nFrom the AG debate that that was held this week and we have we sure did we learn that January ... will not defend Arizona law if she disagrees with it or find it to be unconstitutional she's not going to leave that to the courts to decide\nShe's going to decide and recused herself and have Arizona hire someone else to step in and can you imagine if a sheriff\nDecided to make arrests based on what laws he agreed with I mean it it shows that fundamental either lack of understanding for that position or an inability to execute the position but it was amazing to hear that in the closing minutes of that debate\n... well what you're talking about is I think a difference of opinion about the um the the lawsuit related to in state tuition for dreamers so I'm you know juniors position is that you know dreamers or should get in state tuition and that's her interpretation of the law\nI think another thing that was a it was a big point of contention related to the clean energy initiative and the attorney general's position or involvement in the ballot description for that uh initiative\nYou know obviously there's been a a reaction to that from the clean energy folks 'cause they've committed to spending over three million dollars to help her um and so I think there are some significant you know developments that came out of that because now you know she might be the most well funded as far as outside money of all the statewide candidates whether that's going to work or not we'll see but she'll have that money\nAnd and any time you see\nAn out of state billionaire dumped millions of dollars to target our top law enforcement officer in the state that should get voters' attention and I thought part of it just said from that I thought he handled himself very well and that may in fact I think that's who we're looking at\nAs a twenty twenty two gubernatorial candidate I mean he really showed well\nThat wouldn't be surprised if there were so generous and ... um first big run for office as attorney general but rather she have a future if she ends up losing by a lot in this race has she has she impressed you anywhere but she's someone that they could do something in the future it er yeah I mean I Hope\nAnd and I thought part of it just said from that had he handled himself very well and that may in fact I think that we're looking at as a ... I mean he really showed well\nThat wouldn't be surprised if there were so January ... I'm a first big run for office as attorney general but rather she have a future if she ends up losing by a lot in this race has she has she impressed you in any way that she's someone that they could do something in the future\nAnd yeah I mean I Hope she wins obviously British she doesn't um you know she's a very impressive person I've known her for years I mean she's got a tremendous uh history resume from working with Janet ... you know forming a nonprofit certainly um you know going forward if she were to lose this race I Hope she runs for something else\nBased on what Emily said is burned up it's someone if he were to win again as he sort of an obvious candidate looking at ups and not knowing what might happen in the next couple of years we don't know you know what goes on is he a prime named bill coming up as far as the Democrats need to think about going to guess Republicans in the future\nI tell my friends and family that it's closer than you think and I think the last puzzle as to work with regulators and consumer groups\nI tell my friends and family that it's closer than you think and I think the last uh laws do work with regulators and consumer groups to establish that trust proved that it's safe or so that we can deploy these vehicles widely for all to enjoy\nAll right that's Jacqui senior principal engineer at intel working on an automated vehicle standards there jak thanks for your time appreciate it say\n\nWhen a design Sherman manufacturer of outdoor furniture bought a building in downtown Glendale more than a few eyebrows were raised but it wasn't the nature of the business it was the price paid for the building there'll be housed the\nReporter Gen five field at the Arizona Republic said the space went for a song just twenty five thousand dollars given the Glendale paid seven thirty five thousand for the building ten years ago some people wondered if this was a sweetheart deal people like John riches director of national litigation for the Goldwater Institute\nThe city is giving away property value to several hundred thousand dollars for twenty five thousand that as a just international matter\nA doesn't doesn't look right this does seem like an awful large delta between what they paid for the land and what they sold it for and frankly that's part of the problem right I mean the city should have um the ... value it's asset\nIt should know exactly what it's worth that should then I'm going to sell an asset go through a process where it's going to receive something close to market value for it\nBy Glendale city manager Kevin ... said the sale was organic legal and we'll be profitable in the long term you say Glendale laid out a series of promises the new owners must keep and the show's learned guilty or talk with Phelps about the guidelines\nThey worked with our economy\nUm the ... value it's asset it should know exactly what it's worth that should then I'm going to sell enough to go through a process where it's going to receive something close to fair market value for it\nBy Glendale city manager Kevin Phelps said the sale was organic legal and we'll be profitable in the long term you said Glendale laid out a series of promises the new owners must keep and the show's learnt yogurt topped with Phelps about the guidelines\nThey worked with our econ development team to put together a letter of intent there were really strong provisions that required them to invest a significant amount of money to bring the building up to code and including timelines for when they would have to do that\nAnd then finally they provided the city with the that if for some reason they were going to sell the building within the first five years that the city had the right to purchase the building back\nWhat's the goal here I guess it sounds like from some they're reporting on the fact that that downtown Glendale needs some sort of investment like that you can't help burn idolize it\nOur downtown area unlike the rest of our city which is booming in terms of private investment on the commercial side has really struggled to get private investment\nComing into our our downtown most of our buildings that people who own our existing buildings are not investing significant sums of money I can think of really to property owners out entire downtown that have spent you know any kind of significant resources over the last five years\nWe we felt having a I'm an owner operator willing to invest significant amount of money to bring a building up to code\nWas ideal for us\nThis one business when you look at the total amount of tax collection that we generate from our downtown it's projected this single business will increase\nThe city's collection by almost ten percent\nAn owner operator willing to invest significant amount of money to bring a building up to code was ideal for us\nThis one business when you look at the total amount of tax collection that we generate from our downtown it's projected this single business will increase\nThe city's collection by almost ten percent by one business\nWas the goal also that these business owners if they weren't you invest in downtown Glendale would attract others\nAbsolutely you know I'm you know I kind of joke Leah revert to laugh when I first met them as the other they remind me that hipsters though there's probably a better word for that [laughter]\nThis is you know this is a young couple that had a presence on Roosevelt way and in Phoenix and they they're not afraid to go into a downtown to a community it's going to change\nAnd and to have their business there and so yes I Believe they will be what I Would call an a tractor I think they very much could be a catalyst for other people in the coming into downtown and bringing their business here and operating their business here\nRight right but of course this ... is coming into question the Goldwater Institute says they're going to research if this was illegal under the state's gift claws on Arizona Republic calmness Joanna all hands commented that that the city here failed when they didn't get an official appraisal what's your response to these criticisms\nWell one we didn't have an M. A. appraisal done but we had looked at this property very very closely\nUnder the thought that we may move are a ... a division of the city or to that site\nAnd our estimation knowing all the elements that had to be improved in that building our price tag came in approximately a one point two million dollars and we just couldn't justify that kind of a cost so we were very ...\nWe had looked at this property very very closely\nUnder the thought that we may move are a ... a division of the city or to that site and our estimation knowing all the elements that had to be improved in that building our price tag came in approximately a one point two million dollars\nAnd we just couldn't justify that kind of a cost so we were very aware of what it would take for a new owner\nTo achieve a certificate of occupancy on this site\nIt needs everything from structural foundation HVAC electrical plumbing the entire band have to be brought up to code and so uh you know they're looking at probably investing north of six hundred thousand dollars on this property\nNow here's the the new ones if you went in and dinner an appraisal let's say they get that building open\nAnd they've got seven hundred thousand dollars all in cost\nWhen the bank goes to praise on how much they will end on that property\nThey will want to know how much income could generate or if they had to take that property over and I believe that if they were once they open this up if they were to do a new appraisal they very likely will find that they are upside down with what they have invested in it\nSo I spoke with John Rich is with the Goldwater Institute and he said that that this is just not the process that cities should go through that they should go to a formal public process do you think that the city should have done that here\nI Would argue that there are a number of legal means that charter cities like Glendale had been given to dispose of assets and that's why you sell an asset for is only part of how you make a decision on behalf of our citizens now if we just put up for sale sign on it somebody\nThey should go through a formal public process do you think that the city should have done that here\nI Would argue that there are a number of legal means that charter cities like Glendale had been given to dispose of assets\nAnd that what you sell an asset for\nIs only part of how you make a decision on behalf of our citizens now if we just put up for sale sign on it somebody has the right to buy that property in a set on it or be built in an apartment complex you say well what's so bad about an apartment complex the differences\nThe revenue we will receive a parliament building would be less than probably a hundred thousand dollars a year in property taxes that we would receive in our share what was the best deal what was in the best interest of our citizens\nAt the end of the day it's about representing the tax payers interest\nAnd and when you go to sell an asset you have the immediate gain of the asset and then you have the long term benefits that asset still may generate and I would argue that in the case of cities it's to our interest to find that type of development\nThat will continue to support our general fund so we can have quality fire and police services good parks that there is a a long term value as compared to the immediate value\nKevin ...
