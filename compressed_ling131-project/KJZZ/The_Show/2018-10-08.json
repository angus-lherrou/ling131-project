letter from US education secretary Betsy divorce the deer parent letter aims to explain the every student succeeds act or yes essay and what parents need to know about it\nThis is part of devices rethink school tour which starts later this week in Wyoming and co Colorado was supposed to talk about all this is Alison Kline assistant editor for Education Week Alison hello\n[noise] Hi thanks for having me\nWell thanks for being here so what exactly does this letter say and what is sort of a point of the education department sending this out to all these birds\nSo the point of the a guide to help explain the new law that replaced No Child left behind the um the replacement laws called the every student succeeds act\nIt actually pass almost three years ago back in two thousand and Fifteen 'em by the education department and wanted to explain it in plain language I'm that parents can understand so that's what they were released last week actually when they were doing there a rethink schools tore\nA this year they they rethink schools were went through um southern states Georgia Mississippi Alabama and Louisiana it was actually last year that it went into states like Wyoming in Colorado\nOkay so how different is yes as a from No Child left behind which parents may be are familiar with if they had kids and in public schools at that time\nThere are some key similarities in that\nBoth laws require students to take tests in grades three through eight and one's in high school and reading and math I'm by No Child left behind was really prescriptive about what should happen in schools that were found to be falling behind whereas asked us uh give states a lot of running room when it comes to how to fix low performing schools\nHow to train teachers and what kind of standards to you\nClarity is in that both laws require students to take tests in grades three through eight and once in high school in reading and math um but No Child left behind was really prescriptive about what should happen in schools that were found to be falling behind whereas\nAsked us uh give states a lot of running room when it comes to how to fix low performing schools how to train teachers and what kind of standards to use\nIs this new approach Dallas and had to direct direct ... parents in particular like write them a letter I don't know if I've heard of something like this coming out of the federal government like this before\nYou know I don't remember anything quite like this where there was a letter to parents but certainly I'm going back all the way the secretary spellings Secretary Duncan 'em and secretary king those were um President Bush and President Obama's education secretary as you know they made reaching out to parents a big part of their agenda to all of them\nSergeant at arm's will restore order and the girl [noise] and\nBrett Kavanaugh is the newest justice on the Supreme Court although the voting was almost entirely along party lines there were some senators whose votes we were all watching among them Susan Collins of Republican from Maine and Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia and the only Democrat who voted to confirm Kavanaugh\nCollins who will be up for reelection twenty twenty was a crucial swing vote in the cabinet appointments and she ultimately voted to confirm\nMentioned is currently running for reelection and the state that Trump won by a forty percent margin of victory so where the political realities each is facing in their own states joining us to discuss this is Emily Stewart a reporter with box Hi Emily thanks for having me and we're also joined by Jake Zuckerman a political reporter with the Charleston Gazette mail Hi Jake\n... so I Want to start with you a senator Collins came out this weekend um to defend her vote on Kavanaugh let's take a listen to what she said on CNN I Do believe that she was assaulted\nI don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was\nThe U.S [noise] Emily a Collins is not up for re election in November but from what you've seen what's the reaction been so far to her vote I mean obviously she there was a lot of attention on\nHi I'm Phil Latzman and thanks for listening to cages easiest audio service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in non profit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all of their accounting each\n... you work part time controller dot com or to her\nVote I mean obviously she there was a lot of attention on her for the past several weeks and so\nThis is a very big deal and there has been a lot of focus on her and she sort of put herself in the center of this and to an extent because on friday she gave that very long speech he didn't have to do that you had Joe mansion put out a tweet she spoke for twenty thirty minutes on the Senate floor and then this weekend was really out there defending herself\nShe has made a decision and she is sticking to it and I think she's telling people whatever you think of this I decided and I'm sticking with it\nAnd the one of the political realities that she was weighing in making this decision I think there was a lot of frustration from what we could see with that twenty thirty minutes speech that she gave 'em all how our main ers reacting\nI mean she pretty popular in Maine and this seems to have at least for the time being harmed her obviously she's not up for election 'til twenty twenty so there's a lot of time between now and then that people are disappointed I'm\n... we'll see sort of what happens in the next several months and years but I think that a lot of her constituents are disappointed and more broadly I think women around the United states who are looking to her\nTo defend them are also disappointed and her well and then not just disappointed there actually putting money um towards funding her opponent um what have we seen about that so far there's been a crowdfunding campaign to support whoever that the opponent would be whoever the Democratic opponent would be\nRight so there's a crowdfunding campaign run by being\nI think women around the United states who are looking to her to defend them are also disappointed and her\nWell and then not just disappointed there actually putting money um towards funding her opponent um what have we seen about that so far there's been a crowd funding campaign to support whoever that the opponent would be whoever the Democratic opponent would be\nRight so there is a crowdfunding campaign run by it be a hero which is a group founded by the activists any barking and they've raised about three point five million dollars to go toward who ... runs against her and twenty twenty and that is a big amount of money I spoke with him over the weekend and\nYou know they said that that might be a game changer for whoever does decide to run against her gets the nomination in twenty twenty obviously there are a little optimistic about that but it's a lot of money\nThat's already against turned into it also shows a lot of sort of what they describe rage donations and people trying to channel that anger and and upset and with this\nToward something more active\nJake let's say a ... a move to West Virginia here where Joe Manchin who's a Democrat or is up for re election this November in a very tight race in a very pro Trump state I'm imagining he's not getting rage donations or his candidate is not getting rage donations Jake\n[noise] well you know I haven't seen any of the numbers of late but I can tell you that there is just a lot of deflation on the ground among progress keeps here in the state and I think a lot of people are really wrestling with where'd you go from here and what do you do you know I think that\nAny any sort of third party vote or a outside party vote is really just going to support Republican candidates and then there's this question of\nWell is that the best option here is that the best way to go or or just kind of want to hedge our bets and pick a guy who's with me sometimes who didn't come through for me last week\nIs the is the reaction there among folks that they wanted mentioned to not\nYou know I think that any any sort of third party vote or any outside party vote is really just going to support Republican candidates and then there's this question of\nWell is that the best option here is that the best way to go or do I just kind of want to hedge our bets and pick a guy who's with me sometimes who didn't come through for me last week\nIs the is the reaction there among folks that they wanted mentioned too not not to support Kevin ... is that what\nYou're telling us among progressive yet but I think among the bulk of the state you know especially when you look at the margins that Trump won by that I think it's a it's a safe to say that in general people want a president to get his justices through and people want a president to get his Supreme Court justices on the bench\nAnd I think that a lot of issues that people took up with match it was the timing of the vote and I think that people really saw how quickly his decision was made after Susan Collins made her for speech and raise the question of you know why why we're just hearing about this position at the eleventh hour\nYou know literally minutes after the vote was decided effectively well\nAnd I'm Wondering to both of you both for Collins and uh for mansion um you know the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said this weekend that you know basically this is going to blow over people are going to move on um we're just weeks away from the mid term election do you have a sense that\nThis is going to blow over Emily and with manners or is this something that's going to have an impact and Jacob with with folks over in West Virginia\nI mean it's really hard to tell them you think of the paste is in in psych them move that like a few weeks ago we thought media Rod Rosenstein was going to be really hard you know a few weeks ago I think I might [laughter] take are you keeping track I'm I'm having trouble\nThough it seems like there are three fold news cycles every day so I've lost count\nBut I mean did you guys think this is going to motivate them\nMean it's really hard to tell if you think of the pace of the news cycle and moves that like a few weeks ago we thought maybe of Rod Rosenstein was going to be really hard you know we only a few weeks ago I think I might [laughter] Jake are you keeping track I'm I'm having trouble [laughter]\nSo it seems like there are three full news cycles every day so I've lost count\n[laughter] but really I mean do you guys think this is going to motivate Democrats more or Republicans more or or is it still a wait and see game Jake\n[noise] um I think more than you know a special mounted inflation from the vote my guess is that you see some deflation among Democrats in that there's just not going to be the same excitement to go out and vote\nWell I I think that you have seen some Republican gal says Asians say and you see some people who are geared up and see\nYou know Democrats really really pushing to try to stop this confirmation process so I think that there are a little bit fired up and then\nIn the end there was this huge amount of democratic energy here in West Virginia and there were protests outside mansions office every day and there were active is getting arrested outside of the office D.C office adage Charleston office last week\nWhat about a ... on over here Emily that she was there a similar reaction\nYeah I mean and you even see ahead of the vote where they had to shut down the hallway outside of her off as she can get including ours in the mail I mean there's been quite a bit of blowback here\nSo we should be expecting a very uh exciting next couple of weeks I'm assuming I Would imagine mhm Jake for you as well [noise] I Would bet so yeah and we used to it as a reporter with Fox and Jake Zuckerman is politics reporter for the Charleston Gazette mail things to you both for joining us thank you thank you\nBoom boom boom boom

reporter with boxing Jake Zuckerman is a politics reporter for the Charleston Gazette mail things to you both for joining us thank you thank you\n[noise]\nDuring justice Kavanaugh Senate hearing he put forward a theory regarding the origins of allegations of sexual assault this\nWhole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election fear that has been unfairly\nStoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nAmong Americans there is increasing concerned that the Supreme Court is becoming a partisan and political body and the recent controversy over judge Kavanaugh's appointment which included an FBI investigation may only further divided the nation and its opinion of the court\nProfessor Barbara Perry is with us and she's the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center Dr Perry thanks for joining the takeaway\nIt's my pleasure [noise] so let's start with some fundamentals what is the role of the Supreme Court Dr Perry and how has that role lined up historically with how Americans view the Supreme Court\nSometimes the court and the federal judiciary are called the third branch so when we think about their role I often think of it is that third voice in our three branches of government\nAnd have Americans generally viewed the court as fair yes we have developed this image of the court that is above the ... of daily politics\nSometimes the court and the federal judiciary are called the third branch so when we think about their role I often think of it is that third voice in our three branches of government\nAnd have Americans generally viewed the court as fair\nYes we have developed this image of the court that is above the ... of daily politics\nNow I'm going to uh make an assumption here Dr Perry that that perception has greatly and drastically changed there's good news and bad\nNews I think for the court in this realm I after what we've just been through over the last few weeks the good news for the court is that it almost\nAlways out paces Congress or the president when approval ratings are taking the bad news is as we've just been saying over these last few weeks and particularly with the most recent controversies surrounding justice Kavanaugh it may be that the court will take a hit on that\nBut let's think back to Bush Gore in two thousand polarized nation polarized vote on George Bush and Al Gore and the court polarized five to four in effect deciding Bush Gore in favor of Bush and giving him the presidency despite the fact that he lost the popular vote\nThan ranchers or or a fisherman or or foragers might and so part of it is a language barrier and I happened to to service a translator and some of these conversations there's other people who are really leading it\nBut I help with that facilitates them so that people can really hear each other deeply and it satisfying because all these people have valuable Contra ... contributions to make sure our economy in ecology\nTo some of it ultimately boils down to sort of common sense the fact that we ... we have more in common than differences you\nI hit the nail on the head that we really have more in common than we have ah\nIn difference about taking care of the lovely place we live in in Arizona but people are on\nDifferent points of the spectrum in terms of writing proactive activities versus regulation or who pays for it is it going to attack us more\nAnd all that kind of thing but once we get together and talk about our common goals we can usually get over those other barriers and stumbling block so I have a lot of faith in Arizona since ...\nLiving in Arizona but people are on\nDifferent points of the spectrum in terms of running proactive activities versus regulation or who pays for it is going to tax is more\nAnd all that kind of thing but once we get together and talk about our common goals\nWe can usually get over those other barriers and stumbling block so I have a lot of faith in Arizona and\nThat there is a good will and the knowledge and skills and talents to bring us all together at a time when our country feel so divided very Paul ... is off for the new book food from the radical center healing our land and communities here thank you for coming in oh I'm so grateful to be here\nAnd [noise]\nWhen you're thinking about a snack do you think about the calorie count lots of companies making market one hundred calorie snacks everything from popcorn to crackers to energy bars and new research looks into how effective that kind of marketing is especially when the number of calories is combined with other descriptions of the snack like jumbo war small\nChristopher ... has been doing this research he's a clinical assistant professor in the marketing department at ASU WB carry school of business and Chris we're do people actually like knowing exactly how many calories are in the snack foods they're eating\nThat's that's a good question I Would in some ways yes and I get there you know there's certainly a\nOf consumer somewhere very health focusing so they're much more in tune with both the labeling on the back of the package but sugar counting those more incremental health cues\nAnd there are some people who don't carry I mean you pick up a box of cookies and you are going to eat them regardless so I think at the place to that in some ways that even on on the labeling the FDA requires that packages over fifty calories around it to the nearest ten packages under\nThe labeling on the back of the package but sugar counting those more incremental health cues\nAnd there are some people who don't carry I mean you pick up a box of cookies and you you're gonna eat them regardless so I think the FDA place to that in some ways that\nEven on on the ... the FDA requires that packages over fifty calories around it to the nearest ten packages under a fifty calories around it to the nearest five for the most part and so we don't see a whole ton of kind of\nSmall changes in calorie count for the cause of\nBoth you know consumers might not care down to that degree but also in terms of processing it's tough to identify or control for for variation in processing that might lead to a one calorie increase or decrease\nIs there's something magical about the number one hundred for consumers I mean you don't see a lot of snack packs like hey it's only fifty calories or it's a hundred and twenty calories or two hundred calories like is there something about the number one hundred that maybe people think sure I can eat these cookies it's only a hundred calories what's the big deal\nBut I think just in general I think there's something special about kind of that hundred number I mean in terms of food at a reasonable number where you get enough of the actual item and if we had fifty calorie\nCookie ... if you'd probably get a half a cookie and [laughter] they're not much you eat\nAnd so the idea of having a hunter I think it is a pretty solid amount of balance that kind of food interests or the amount of food in the package with not having too many calories\nIn some ways are consumers maybe just looking at dancing oh it's a hundred calories you can't be that bad for me ... without maybe looking at the sugar content or the carbohydrate content or some of the other nutritional information on that package\nAbsolutely I'm not a a nutritionist by any measure but I Would argue that calories is one of the first things we look we flip the box over um and we look at that calorie information\nIn some ways are consumers maybe just looking at dancing oh it's a hundred calories you can't be that bad for me ... without maybe looking at the sugar content or the carbohydrate content or some of the other nutritional information on that package\nAbsolutely I'm not a a nutritionist by any measure but I Would argue that calories is one of the first things we look we flip the box over um and we look at that calorie\nInformation first before sugar and some of those other things or to the point that the FDA recently changed their labels\nTo emphasize the calorie counts we'll see if you go to the grocery store you'll see some of the older packaging that has calorie count much smaller and any sort of new product or a product that's been reform added you'll see the calorie count in a much bigger bold fought\nWhat did you find as far as the language that goes along with that calorie count on some of those packages and how consumers respond to that\nSort of our research found that generally speaking consumer send it to evaluate the product more favorably if the language match the Catholic so for example Ninety nine calories and small was more favorable than Ninety nine calories and big\nAnd then a lot of ways that makes sense that if it's Ninety I always end up in a big package of cookies or popcorn or whatever it might be it would be maybe sort of confusing to process and there's some\nPsychological literature that suggests we don't like that kind of discomfort of having to just say well it's only nine calories and also you know a lot of cookies in there that kind of tough to to process\nDoes that indicate to some extent that consumers are kind of smart about this that if they have a hundred calorie pack for example of even if it's something bad for them they sort of recognize you know I'm going to have maybe just a little piece of this but it's not going to be maybe as much as I Would eat if calories were no object for example\n... absolutely I mean especially I think in today's kind of world and I think we've seen some shifts in terms of\nDoes that indicate to some extent that consumers are kind of smart about this that if they have a hundred calorie pack for example of even if it's something bad for them they sort of recognize you know I'm going to have maybe just a little piece of this but it's not going to be maybe as much as I Would eat if calories were no object for example\n... absolutely I mean especially I think in today's world and I think we've seen some chefs in terms of health perceptions just across the country and as part of the reason for these hundred calorie packs has to cater to that\nOr maybe more health conscious consumers realizing that yeah and I want some cookies but I Can't eat the whole boxing for this kind of that uh that middle ground at the same time I I think the sort of effort going into shopping and we're not necessarily going to stand there and debate all the merits of\nLovers big Ninety nine percent hundred versus all of these I mean on every single product we\nWe have a limited time to go to the grocery store I Want to get through what we need\nSo you know the Labor Day can help us\nI decide those things but at the same time we're not necessarily going to stand there and go into a detailed of mental processing or decision making over\nA box of Christopher ... is a clinical assistant professor

Flagstaff and the surrounding areas got their first dose to a dusting of snow for the season\nAnd while this is not unheard of it's pretty unusual to see snow this really in here to tell us more about that is Robert Ricky meteorologist with the national weather service in Flagstaff Robert good morning It's MORNING it was a winter wonderland up there how many inches did you guys get\nA you know here in Flagstaff we received anywhere from a half inch to an inch of snow but we did have two inches a recorded and Williams and also further east in shallow and the big winner of course would have been Arizona stole the gap between four to six inches\nRight so how rare is is to see snow up there this early in October\nYou know it it's it's not unusual to get snow in October but it's very unusual to get it this early and\nDavid anywhere from a half inch to an inch of snow but we did have two inches a recorded and Williams and also further east in shallow than the big winner of course would have

the governor has done and sort of what he stood for and how much of it as sort of the campaign that David Garcia has rented you referenced that in in the endorsements\nWell they've got to see you have to remember that four years ago he ran for the superintendent of public instruction\nAnd he ran as a centrist and he had Lisa Graham Keegan by aside and Jaime malaria too well known Republicans within the education community former superintendent ... exactly and he won Maricopa County barely ...\nHe has run 'cause you referenced that in in the endorsements well they've\nGot to see you have to remember that four years ago he ran for the superintendent of public instruction\nAnd he ran as a centrist and he had Lisa Graham Keegan by aside and Jaime malaria too well known Republicans within the education community former superintendent ... exactly and he\nWon Maricopa County barely lost the race but he won Republican rich Maricopa County which is really an incredible achievement for a Democrat first time running\nAnd so he created these bona fide he said he was a centrist okay then we come for years later to the Democratic primary for governor and he runs far to the left I mean he is he's going and backing this idea that we need to replace a ice OK immigration and Customs Enforcement\nAnd that was an idea that came out of the congressional race in Queens New York and it works beautifully there where Seventy five percent of the electorate is Latino and Puerto Rican American\nIt's not going to work in Phoenix, Arizona was way too far to the left it open the door for attacks that he has seen in the general election has been trying to repair that ever since\nYou referenced education and in the endorsement you referenced a few other issues that the governor has been dealing with I'm Wondering if there's maybe one other besides education which is of course dominated this race as we all thought it would anything else that sort of in your mind\nFluids governor do see sort of at the top of of the heap in terms of this particular race well the one\nThat probably makes him unbeatable and I'm probably nobody could beat him because of it or not just David Garcia but anybody the Democrats would have put up\nAnd that as you have a strong economy the air's on our economy is back it's booming well ahead of the national economy on job growth and remember they do she came in and heritage and ... billion dollar plus deficits\nOf the heap in terms of this particular race well the one that\nProbably makes him unbeatable and and probably nobody could beat him because of it or not just David Garcia but anybody the Democrats would have put up\nAnd that is you have a strong economy the air's on our economy is back it's booming well ahead of the national economy on job growth\nAnd remember they do she came in and heritage and you know billion dollar plus deficits so I mean he took a state that was ... he has helped turn it around we've got a strong economy now Arizona reflects the national economy but it's doing better than the national economy on on the jobs front so\nA governor is going to get credit for that may be too much but they also get too much blame when they'd go south so um that's how it works in politics\nI Want to ask you about the concept of endorsements broadly and I know that you've talked about this in the past I'm Wondering what role in twenty Eighteen a newspaper endorsement for any office but in this case the governor really has on how people look at the race maybe how people will vote\nIt's a great question and we're not sure the answer but we're getting that endorsements a lot differently than we used to we will write as many as four different versions of a an endorsement during the election time so we have we have one that we've written for print audience\nAnd this is a traditional print audience that has a strong knowledge of politics will write for an online audience that has younger and maybe not as aware of
