P. dot org [noise]\nYesterday afternoon cage easy easy hosted a debate among the for corporation commission candidates Democrats Sandra Kennedy and Keanu Maria Sears\nAnd Republicans Rodney Glassman injustice Olson our co host Steve Goldstein moderated that discussion and he's here now to talk about one of the subjects that was covered by mark yeah we covered a lot of ground during the conversation that included whether there should be an ethical code of conduct the commissioners should have to follow\nBecause the commission has been called the most important agency no one knows about but that changed dramatically with headlines generated by questions about among other things where the commissioners were accepting campaign money other perks from utilities they were regulating so I asked the candidates what ethical code of conduct would make sense to them and I pose the question first to Rodney Glassman\nThat needs to be fixed in it needs to be cleaned up\nAnd so rather than parts together a series of different recommendations as a practicing attorney is an air force officer in the jak or someone\nWho knows about different codes of conduct as an Eagle Scout his license real estate broker there's one that works and it works well it it it every state has one is called the code of conduct its judicial code of conduct every state Supreme Court writes a code of conduct that code of conduct is binding\nOn every judge from the Supreme Court down to the locally up\nSing attorney is an air force officer in the jak or someone\nWho knows about different codes of conduct as an Eagle Scout his license real estate broker there's one that works and it works well and it it every state has one is called the code of conduct of judicial code of conduct every state Supreme Court writes a code of conduct that code of conduct is binding\nOn every judge from the Supreme Court down to the locally appointed small claims hearing officer in the local elected justice of the peace\nAnd the question that I asked and I posed this to the commission as they were adopting their code of ethics as they call it that was why not just adopted judicial code of conduct why not hold yourself to the exact same standards as every other judge in the state of Arizona and and that truly needs to be the first step\nIf we're going to protect Arizona ratepayers this Kennedy would you support a formal code of ethics and what are some details for somebody who support\nYou know the judicial code of conduct\nIs for the third branch of government the Arizona corporation commission is the fourth branch of government and should have their own code of ethics when it was voted on back in March I said that it wasn't worth the paper that it was printed on\nYou could actually drive a rate increase through it\nThere needs to be ... in the code of ethics that says you cannot accept food\nYou cannot accept airline tickets you cannot go and stay at a hotel\nThat it should be out of the question but this commission did not go that far so everything you see and air code of ethics allows them to do the same thing that they've done\nUp until today is they can take anything except anything from any lobbyists any monopoly that they are\nI go and stay at a hotel that it should be out of the question but this commission did not go that far so everything you see and air code of ethics allows them to do the same thing that they've done\nUp until today is they can take anything except anything from any lobbyists any monopoly that they choose to what I Would like to see is just stop you regulate the monopoly us supposed to be there on behalf of the rate payers act like it\nStaff should not be allow a revolving door from the commission to go work for the monopolies that is not proper at all\nAnd if they're going to do it then give them a year or two year moratorium and then after that year or two moratorium then allowed that former staffer to go and work for the monopoly the strokes and\nActually voted for these policies that have been discussed here today I voted to prohibit\nCandidates for the commission from accepting campaign contributions I offered to that amendment I voted for it as was mentioned there were not enough votes to an act that policy more work needs to be done so the question how did the code of ethics go far enough it absolutely did not and that's why I offered amendments to make it a much more meaningful\nCode of ethics I offered an amendment to prohibit\nCommissioners and candidates for the commission for my receiving any benefit\nFrom the utilities that we regulate those are policies that I support those are policies that I've proposed to make that a prohibition for all commissioners and candidates for the commission and those are policies\nThat I Will continue to advocate for and support in another term at the commission about the most important policy is the individual behavior of any elected official and that's what I\nShould remain receiving any benefit from the utilities that we regulate those are policies that I support those are policies that I've proposed to make that a prohibition for all commissioners and candidates for the commission and those are policies\nThat will continue to advocate for and support in another term at the commission about the most important policy is the individual behavior of any elected official and that's what I think the voters should look to how has an individual performed in elected office when I got appointed to the commission\nI immediately made it a part of my campaign policy that we would not accept any campaign contribution or anything of benefit from any of the utilities that we regulate I enacted that policy for my\nCampaign then I began advocating for a policy to make that a a requirement or a prohibition for all candidates for the commission there's work to be done there are challenges at the commission there what challenges\nWhen I arrived at the commission but I've been part of the solution and I will continue to be part of the solution ... what sort of ethical code of conduct to mix there should be if any\nProblem before us has this when you hear the judicial code of conduct and I'm One of my opponents constantly says I'm the only candidate calling for that he merely the only candidate calling for that because we actually see the loopholes and actually adopting the judicial\nCode of conduct\nWhen you have the opportunity to specify and clarify and adopt a policy for the fourth branch of government\nYou need a new language the loopholes exist and have existed because we've taken piecemeal from the judicial code of conduct right now there's part of the judicial code of conduct that exist in the rules that are allowing our commissioners too\nFi and adopt a policy for the fourth branch of government\nYou need a new language the loopholes exist and have existed because we've taken piecemeal from the judicial code of conduct right now there's part of the judicial code of conduct that exist in the rules that are allowing our commissioners to\nTake these foods take these trips do all these things that's not ethical and ethics is a personal thing\nSo for me it's not about the games it's not about dirty politics it's about clean politics that's why we've chosen to run\nAs clean elections candidates to make sure that we any money that we receive its public every single name is there as a clean elections candidate\nThat's why we've chosen to do that my code of conduct will actually and what I Believe is what you see what I live and what I Do as a public servant\nThose were the four candidates for Arizona corporation commission speaking at a potential ethical code of conduct they were speaking at a debate

think that's right I mean you have your classic biographical spots which had that positive ones are candidates are walking through a park with her family and invariably a dog and then you have the attack ads which are going to go after the opponent usually end up policy based way although we're certainly seeing some more personal attacks as well\nAnd Steve let's talk about the money\nHere I

day rap you Casey 'cause usually the News Phoenix [laughter]\n\nIt's just a few weeks until mid term election day on November six but as you're making decisions about who to vote for the president of the national association of secretaries of state recently said that cyber security is with keeping many of them up at night\nIn fact Arizona secretary of state Michelle Reagan just released an election security report that says in part the root cause of previous technology compromises in our election systems\nAnd failures of process ... ... people and awareness but the report says our state has made investments aimed at improving the integrity of that election process\nWe wanted to take a bird's eye view of national elections security so we turned to dumb Deborah Plunkett senior fellow at Harvard bell for center and I asked her first about the efforts to make so to make at the efforts so far at the federal level to bolster confidence and integrity and the election system\nWell certainly there has been some funding that was a allocated over a year ago at the federal level there was a push in the spring for additional funding for the states for that did not make it through Congress\nWhat has transpired as at this the federal government certainly has been much more active and reaching out to the states conducting testing and training for the state's helping them to assess their particular election infrastructure networks and just generally providing good guide and\nSay well let's back up then and talk about where we are now so what threats are they're currently to our election systems as we head into these November elections\nAnd much more active and reaching out to the states conducting testing and training for the state's helping them to assess their particular election infrastructure networks and just generally providing good guide and\nSay well let's back up then and talk about where we are now so what threats are they're currently to our election systems as we head into these November elections\nThere are a threat to everyday always to all kinds of systems and infrastructure and an targets the ones that we have heard about the U.S for a few of them have been a advertised\nIn the past couple of weeks actually with some Russians being charged with some focus on us watching systems\nAnd capabilities and nation states as well as just threats you know bad actors will be doing all they can during that critical time for us to have us lose confidence in our election systems or to literally render them not valid in some way\nOkay what do you think should be done at this point given the the the the condition of those threats\nWell here's what I Would say is if you haven't been doing anything already at this point it's almost too late that's the bad news the good news is that most if not all of the states have responded very well to the information that places like fell for\nAnd many other experts in the security space has been sharing openly freely to make sure that they were fully informed on what they needed to do to better harden and secure there and watching as the structures and my experience and moving around the country ... over the past couple of months is that the states have taken very seriously\nSo here in Arizona our secretary of state um conducted a top down look at our election systems and where the threats are and where the vulnerabilities lie and it says essentially that our election system security\nWhat they needed to do to that are hard and insecure if they're on which has the structures and my experience and moving around the country that's over the past couple of months is that the states have taken very seriously\nSo here in Arizona our secretary of state um conducted a top down look at our election systems and where the threats are and where the vulnerabilities lie in that it says essentially that our election system security remains at a reactive level and does that sound about where most states are\nWhat what that says to me is that there's been some security measures taken but there's not enough confidence overall in them because reactive means something bad has happened what do I do about it proactive means I'm not going to let something bad happened I'm going to get in front of that something bad\nAnd put the rights security measures in place to prevent it from happening\nSo what can states do especially given the the the the focused on working with states from the federal level\nPoints number one is understand your infrastructure have a good understanding from end to end of every part of the infrastructure that she used to support the election processes because the elections are driven by the states the good news is that\nWe we have the potential to have a ... up to fifty different iterations of that\nWhich is a good thing from a security perspective I Believe because it provides diversity so that if some you know bad guy wanted to go after all of the United states he or she or it where they would have to be pretty smart and pretty well resourced in order to be able to hit each of the state's independently\nSo each state needs to have a good understanding of what their infrastructure currently looks like they should be applying all of the known security fixes to the weaknesses in vulnerabilities that are known in those systems\nAnd then they should make the assumption that that's not sufficient you have to stay ever vigilant to make\nShe er it was they would have to be pretty smart and pretty well resourced in order to be able to hit each of the state's independently so each state needs to have a good understanding of what their infrastructure currently looks like they should be applying all of the known security fixes to the weaknesses in vulnerabilities that are known in those systems\nAnd then they should make the assumption that that's not sufficient\nYou have to face ever vigilant to make sure that you're staying on top of him\nYeah do you anticipate as we have a week and a half ago here to tell them in terms that that our elections will be safe and true and and no one will be able to kind of hacking in effect these at this point we are we solid in that sense\nI feel good about where we are I remember where we were a year ago that said there's just no time to let your guard down\nEveryone really is going to have to be very very vigilant particularly on election day when there's a flurry of activity there are lots of different moving part\nLots of people coming in and out of the election spaces that ... that are not security conscious and are you know only come one day or maybe for the training and then one day\nAnd it's really sunny critically important at the states or focus laser like focus on making sure that all of the parts that need to protect us both physically as well as digitally are a well protected\nI Want to end with a broader question then um what do you think is needed to kind of rebuild trust in our election system especially given all of the talk about Russian hacking and you know advertising that had misled voters over the last several years\nOh trust in our election system especially given all of the talk about Russian hacking and you know advertising that had misled voters over the last several years\nYou know I think it's easy to to Penn nefarious motives on on

as big hit as some of the states in a in the mid west or um the south let\nMe ask another aspect of the geography is you just reference which is at Arizona is of course the border state Mexico is our biggest trading partner Canada he's another massive trading partner those are the other two countries of course with us that are in\nWhat formerly was known as NAFTA I'm Wondering what kind of impact the fact that Arizona has such important trading relationships with the two other North American countries has in what you found\nYeah it's important to note that while we did look across tariffs I'm across all of the country is so Canada Mexico the European Union and China\nThe bulk at this point are coming from China\nOf course the recent renegotiation of a trade agreement that binds the United states Canada and Mexico has taken some of the heat off of a trade within North America and it seems like that's going to come to a resolution there is some still still some terrorists that exists but it's not a big share of trade\nAnd so in in a sense the the state's reliance on Canada and Mexico is trading partners are is a good thing in that there seems to be um trade policies moving in the right direction with those with those two countries\nMight insulate Arizona a little bit more relative to some other states which are more reliant on exports to other places it sounds like\nThat's right I mean exposure to China is kind of the biggest deal right now and that seems to be where things could even potentially ramp up further um depending on\nA is a good thing in that there seems to

mayor Lauren QB excuse me good morning\nTop in the morning to you [laughter] well so what prompted this discussion and this ultimate vote\nSo we've heard a lot from residents that their ability to use the parks and feel safe in their neighborhood park just compromise\nWe have over forty parks in Tempe and there's been a number of them not not all by any means but parks that where we had increased calls for service and whether it's dogs on a leash law a dog's not on leashes dog attacks um\nOr you know a syringes and the parks needles in the parks or there's been a lot of complaints about bad behavior in the parks\nSo I mean I it just seems like maybe a slightly disproportionate response to say that there are dogs off their leashes so you're going to have armed guards in the park I mean we were there any other or were there any other options that were considered before taking this\nIt's not on leashes dog attacks [laughter] um or you know a syringes and the parks needles in the parks or there's been a lot of complaints about bad behavior in the parks\nSo I mean I it just seems like maybe a slightly disproportionate response to say that there are dogs all through leashes so you're going to have armed guards in the park I mean we were there any other or were there any other options that were considered before taking this route\nWell it's important to note we have private security that we use it at Escalante park and we um have had neighborhood real success with that in the neighborhood is really appreciated to have that increased security in the park and we have security at that\nAt the library at city hall and they simply expands that security ... Clark in Hudson parks and some other parks on a on a rotating basis but it's really important that we ensure that everyone in the community has access to clean safe parks and everyone's\nRight to use the parks are respected and this is not an attempt to criminalize homeless is not at all the homeless have every right to be in the park\nYou know I'm curious how much of what residents have been complaining about it and and the city's response to it is dealing with specifically with homelessness\nI think that's an element of it and I think there are many folks homeless folks in the park who have mental health issues at times and that's why it was so important to me that when we adopted this last week and we actually transferred money from one account than other we've already had this program in place for a while\nBut we partnered with ... impact\nTo they're going to be providing free behavioral health first aid training or to the security officers everyone in Tempe beat\nPd as

all collaborated we could get so much more done and we could leverage resources the daily practice it's challenging to operate that way all the time because you're still faced with this need every

around and again in our state that's a challenge that we face in again in social services sector and homelessness is you know probably\nThe area where people are the most vulnerable and they're not just experiencing homelessness that they lack housing by the time someone shows up at the Human Services campus\nThere also lacking regular access to affordable nutritious food they're lacking access to primary healthcare they're lacking access to regular mental health care they're not just lacking a home\nAnd it's difficult to compete again against other issues when there's only so much for land therapy\nThere's only so much government resource and\nOf those resources is growing\nSo other than money and I know that's a huge one or two out of the nation but other than money\nTo regular mental health care they're not just lacking a home and it's difficult to compete again against other issues when there's only so much for land therapy there's only so much government resource and\nNeither of

forward in this new role as you're trying to help people get back on their feet and get all of these various things that they need\nSome of the non monetary things again where the government really plays a role\nFor me and what I see every day is working with people being discharged from jail and prison and people being just charge shot of the healthcare system or not being able to access the care they need out of the behavioral health system and that system change excites me and\nThat's why I'm enjoying my first trimester because I'm In the intervention and having interactions with people in need every day which could be overwhelmingly depressing at the same time it gives me the content and the data and the anecdotes to work on the longer term systems change\nDo think it's realistic to say that we can end homelessness\nI think it's realistic to say that we could get to this idea of functional zero that's talks about nationally where we intervene and homelessness early and connect
