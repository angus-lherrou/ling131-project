Center for economic progress and Patrick Lewis of the Arizona association of realtors\nAnd Patrick why do you believe that Arizona needs prop one twenty six\n[noise] well we came up\nWith the ... came out and supported the proposition obviously it is something that we have battled down at the Capitol for about seven years now and we firmly believe that small businesses um\nAnd service oriented businesses who are already paying taxes should not have the possibility of being a double taxed so we feel this is something that ah that is needed right now and David you're\nConcerned about prop one twenty six yeah a lot of concerns that it creates special protections from taxation for special industry as well or not given those two other businesses and at the same time it's gonna slashed funding for schools public safety and roads and\nYou know we've been state for over a hundred years and we've made it through that time without the need for this constitutional prevent a provision and and those services or not they tax and I don't see any danger of them being taxed and the future will tell me\nConcerns that it creates special protections from taxation for special industries well I'm not giving those two other businesses and at the same time it's gonna slashed funding for schools public safety and roads and\nYou know we've been estate for over a hundred years and we've made it through that time without the need for this constitutional prevent a provision and and those services have not been tax and I don't see any danger of them being taxed and the future will tell me specifically how would affect schools well what it does is it it takes certain options off the table in terms of taxation as our tax base is\nOur sales tax base has been shrinking over the years and so this would um for example or if you were to buy Microsoft Office for your home computer five years ago you would have gone into a best buy and you would have purchased a CD and paid sales tax for that\nWhile nowadays if you get Microsoft Office you're downloading it from the cloud and that's going to be considered a service and you wouldn't pay so that's how our sales tax base is shrinking and the more it shrinks and and you won't be able to access if this proposition passes\nAnd that's going to mean less money for education and and anything else that we need revenue for Patrick ... well yeah the uh the\nExisting proposition does not affect existing funding in any way so the funds that are there now will still be available\nUm and I really believe that the service tax to put money towards education is a zero sum game\nBecause you're looking to give money to a group that really are the services that we use daycare\nA veterinary services plumbers electricians all those will now costs more so we really feel that that's a zero sum game especially since this does not affect any existing revenue and it was pretty pretty clear that Governor do see can find the money I mean he found the money for the red red movement within about a week so we believe the revenue is there\nSo you see the commercials that talks about you know we're going to tax veterinary services in daycare and childcare and those types of things\nAll those will now costs more so we really feel that that's a zero sum game especially since this does not affect any existing revenue and it was ... pretty clear that Governor and do so you can find the money I mean he found the money for the red thread movement within about a week so we believe the revenue is there\nSo you see the commercials that talks about you know we're going to tax\nVeterinary services in daycare and childcare era and those types of things I'm guessing the the reason that they're doing that is because the polls very well people Arizona's including myself would never want to see those things taxed and and that is exactly why it's unlikely that it would ever be taxed because in Arizona\nToo to tax those things in our legislature we already have a provision in the constitution that would require two thirds vote of the legislature and that was passed by voters back in Nineteen Ninety to\nThe legislature has not passed any tax increases\nSince that time and I'll tell you you know as a former legislator I remember back in two thousand and eight we were going through the worst recession in states history\nWe had a billion dollar hole to climb out of and I remember Governor Brewer back then saying we needed to have all options on the table to get us out of that hole and when you don't have all those options on the table\nAnd because we had some legislators back then that didn't want to consider certain things\nWe ended up with over a billion dollars in cuts to public schools we eliminated funding for community colleges all sorts of things so that's what happens when you don't have options on the table\nPetty let me come back to the two thirds idea legislation to David brought up you also have a current governor and does that affect things down the road as well but the current governor who said he wants to get income tax too is close to zero was possibly he's clearly not a\nPro tax hike governor so I'm Wondering if this why why is the timing right for this even in the situation even if it were really were a good idea for as to why now\nThe last bill was run as a revenue neutral bill so therefore it did not require the two thirds majority so that was a way for them to sidestep now\nCurrent governor and does that affect things down the road as well but the current governor who said he wants to get income tax too as close to zero was possibly he's clearly not a pro tax hike governor so I'm Wondering at this point why is the timing right for this even in the situation even if it were really were a good idea for us and why now\nWell the last bill was run as a revenue neutral bill so therefore it did not require the two thirds majority so that was a way for them to sidestep not rules so uh since that has happened that is why we uh some of those tactics have been used that is why we as we filmed now's the time then uh that we should really have a constitutional amendment so that\nThose that provide the services who are already paying income tax aren't doubly taxed\nNow since the association of realtors is such a strong supporter I'm going to ask you specifically on this why would the realtors group feel this way and if in fact this would affect education one would think that as a real tour makes Arizona and Phoenix a much more attractive place if we have more highly educated people who can afford a nicer homes for\nAbsolutely are and we support education we support teachers we support that funding or however again we feel that it's a zero sum game if you're looking for money for education yet then all of these services that are used by those teachers or it cost them more\nAlso in relation to realtors realtors or a huge part of our communities and work for ... and the American dream we're the only group down at the Capitol that is a lobbying for homeownership for private property rights\nAnd so we feel that uh again that the revenue is there and that small businesses should not be used as as another revenue source when they're already paying taxes\nThey've uh but again you know we made it for over a hundred years in our state without attacks on realty services and I don't see any danger especially with the church two thirds vote requirement that that we ever will see an increase 'cause you just never get the legislative support to do it um but what it does say\nUh again that the revenues there and that small businesses should not be used as as another revenue source when they're already paying taxes\nThey've well but again you know we made it for over a hundred years in our state without attacks on realty services and I don't see any danger especially with the church two thirds vote requirement that that we ever will see an increase 'cause you just never get the legislative support to do it\nUm but what it does say is that you know certain businesses are going to get protections while others want if you're a mom and pop bookstore hardware store\nYou're not going to get the special protections that these other industries will get and I think that's why you're seeing you know governor juicy and David Garcia both opposes proposition what do you get them to agree on anything these days are and you've got Republican and democratic mayors um and it's and it's not just politicians it's firefighters teachers um\nNon Arizona nonprofit alliance the Arizona interfaith they've all come out against it because they see that this is just not good for Arizona Patrick\nI think there's also some misleading information out there ah in regards to some of these a sudden this initiative for instance the the Grand Canyon a report that just came out a Grand Canyon is to report that just came out\nReally wrongly classified um bars restaurants as services that ah that would be omitted from the tackled or omitted from the tax now the department of revenue decides who is taxed not the Grand Canyon Institute so they took a lot of liberties with that\nRight that's a great question one that cities are grappling with right now and I think there's a tendency to to focus on the hard infrastructure or when we think about resilience than it is that\nA but it's also about how our environmental a systems are positions are for example wetlands that has been eroded up for Katrina came actually contributed to a worst storm but it's also our social systems so that means\nBoth the ability of communities are to bounce back um and to come together before during and after an event but it's also how our organizations are able to create more resilient communities and infrastructure and respond to those events\nAnd when we think about infrastructure I mean we with our previous guest we talked a little bit about these ... you know the category for storms we've had four in the past couple of storm seasons we're seeing lots of damage to infrastructure and lots of attempts that building back\nShould we be trying to build things that will withstand anything and everything that nature will throw at us or are you seeing resilience is something that you know perhaps might fail and be able to bounce back more quickly\nUm I think you know that will depend on ...\nYou know the category for storms we've had four in the past couple of storm seasons we're seeing lots of damage to infrastructure and lots of attempts that building back\nShould we be trying to build things that will withstand anything and everything that nature will throw at us or are you seeing resilience is something that you know perhaps might fail and be able to bounce back more quickly\nRight um I think you know that will depend on where you are and community needs um and I think it'll end up being both strategies\nOr there may be hard there may be infrastructure in place that you just have to say you know what we cannot move this power plant right now or at least not for the next Thirty years so we have to make sure that nuclear system for example is protected\nBut there may be other examples where after a storm\nYou know what it does make more sense ah to to give more room to the river or to get more room to the to to the shoreline and you see that happening in places from Staten Island\nIn New York City all the way to the Columbia River and discussions with a cattle farmers about ah how do we how do we let this lead but then compensate you with us\nOr one of the things that comes up often when we're talking about disaster recovery is cost um we you mentioned Staten Island here in New York We're still there's still some folks who are trying to recover from Hurricane Sandy which feels like it was ... to go obviously were ... you know we see folks are dealing with Michael and dealing with Hurricane Maria\nWho is supposed to pay for this type of resilience who do you see is responsible\nFor the long term recovery of these places um and then you know where does the burden really fall here [noise]\nYeah that's a that's a great question I'm and I'm not sure that I have the perfect answer other than to say I think it's all hands on deck um I Know New York or after after Sandy I'm has been looking in the sense that they've been able to ah bring\nWho do you see is responsible for the long term recovery of these places um and then you know where does the burden really fall here\n[noise] yeah that's a that's a great question I'm and I'm not sure that I have the perfect answer other than to say I think it's all hands on deck hum I Know New York or after after Sandy I'm has been looking in the sense that they've been able to ah bring both local of funding for that but also a federal funding\nBut other cities who maybe haven't had a recent disaster right um and then therefore don't have the attention or maybe the access to the federal funding for recovery that a New Yorker others might have\nA are still trying to think about how to fund this so that we're resilient in advance of an event and and and so that they can they don't have the the next Sandy happened to them for example um and so that is about you know what our local uh organizations and local taxpayers willing to bear to prepare for weather and climate\nWell I think that's the that's the big question because when we think about this I I often think what should we\nYou know about resilience I mean is it a question that we have to ask ourselves even more difficult questions about where we decide to build at all I'm thinking about the coastlines I'm thinking about places that are much more\nLikely to be affected should taxpayers be you know dealing with that burden if they themselves aren't the ones who were building in these more precarious areas like who does the burden really fall on at that point if I decide if my home is destroyed and then I decided to build it back\nYou know art I taking the risk of having it destroyed again\nRight exactly and the and in some cases maybe it is that those shoreline properties are that are wealthier neighborhoods as you were talking with your previous guest a but in other cases it it may be communities that don't really have the resources to recover or to build back up because that neighborhood was known as a ...\nBack you know aren't I taking the risk of having it destroyed again\nRight exactly and the and in some cases maybe it is that\nThose shoreline properties are that are wealthier neighborhoods as a you were talking with your previous guest a but in other cases it it may be communities that don't really have the resources to recover or to build back up because\nThat neighborhood was known as the low lying inland flooding neighborhood and no one else wanted to live there and so uh it it became a a lower income area um and so I think it depends um and and you pointed out with your previous guests as well that the insurance system as a as a big part of this\nUm and I think there's going to have to be discussions I'm a between\nYou know federal and local levels and insurance companies about how to best or create a system that\nThat is resilient right it's not just the hard infrastructure that needs to be resilient but it's also these other systems including insurance and an economic systems that need to go into this as well\nRight and also city planning I'm thinking you know a lot of these cities that we'd like a lot of the places we live in as you mentioned it initially probably we're not dealing with these\nUh forces like they're dealing with now uh what what do you think it would take to actually climate proof our communities is that even possible I mean I Know we were reporting on the fact that in the next couple of decades if we don't do something soon we're in a bad situation here climate life\nFor sure and I and I think the the key point there is that it's not that planners that engineers haven't thought about climate and weather or it's just that the climate and weather um that they built into infrastructure over the past fifty plus years\nThat knowledge is now a dated and it's built for climate and weather patterns that really no longer exists 'em yet the storm water pipes that you put it in the ground fifty or Seventy five years ago still have to function now with a different climate um and so I I think it's ... and and I think planners engineers et cetera at the at the city level are increasingly are realizing that uh\nWhether I'm that they built in infrastructure over the past fifty plus years that knowledge is now outdated and it's built for climate and weather patterns that really no longer exists 'em yet the storm water pipes that you put it in the ground fifty or Seventy five years ago still have to function now with the different climate\nUm and so I I think it's ... and and I think planners engineers et cetera the at the city level are increasingly are realizing that uh and it's a it's a real issue whether they're going to be tackling with it a under something called resilience or an office of resilience or they're just sticking together about\nAn noticing the changes in weather patterns and and and how to more effectively deal with it knowing that the future is not going to be like the past\nThat Miller is a professor at the school for the future of innovation and society at Arizona State university and he coal leads the urban resilience sustainability research network which is funded by the national Science Foundation\nAnd that's the ... and it's true when it comes to natural disasters\nThere are some places that are simply more dangerous to live than others one place that we are all too familiar with is the fringe of a suburb or houses going up against undeveloped land there was a high risk of wildfire there yet people are still building tens of thousands of new houses in these places reporter Emily guaranteed that takes it takes a look at why\nI've covered a lot of wildfires\nFire came over the ridge and within minutes it was our house was afraid that I Want to cross the street burned to\nAt a certain point she started wondering what these houses doing here why do we build and places that are likely to burn\nSo today I'm trying to answer that question by focusing on a new development in orange county it's three hundred and forty luxury houses ... dead end street above Yorba Linda with great views of hills in canyons\nIt's called the Esperanza hills Kevin Johnson down he thinks it's a disaster waiting to\nWhat are these houses doing here why\nDo we build and places that are likely to burn so today I'm trying to answer that question by focusing on a new development in orange county it's three hundred and forty luxury houses ... dead end street above Yorba Linda with great views of hills and canyons\nIt's called the Esperanza hills Kevin Johnson though he thinks it's a disaster waiting to happen\nBut the probably the most dangerous started in Southern California that you could put three hundred and forty new families into\nHe's a lawyer for one of the environmental groups that opposes the project and he says what makes this site so dangerous is that it completely burned to the ground ten years ago and the two thousand eight freeway calm\nYou can tell from the cast for news clip does evacuation was a terrifying experience gridlock street and kids running down the road with their pets\nAnd now here comes a plan to add another three hundred and forty house is worth of people in part that's scary too a lot of people who live there like ed Schumann house burned down\nEvacuating that more many people in the same limited infrastructure it's a scary thought\nSo why would anyone want to build in such a risky place\nThere's a demand for people that want to live in those areas for all the history\nThat's the developer of Esperanza hills Doug why more knowledge is the risk but he thinks he can reduce it through things like brush clearing to water tank for firefighting ants fire resistant structures\nI think that the bottom line is as you can and you can protect\nSo that's the developer but why would the board of supervisors approve this project here's one factor\nWill generate eight million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in property tax\nHe acknowledges the risk but he thinks he can reduce it through things like brush clearing to water tank for firefighting ants fire resistant structures\nI think that the bottom line is is you can get it and you can protect\nSo that's the developer but why would the board of supervisors approve this project here's one factor\nIt will generate eight million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in property tax\nOne doesn't carry Lance who weren't why we're at a public meeting last year he lifted off just how much tax revenue the project will generate\nFour million we'll go to the ... century Yorba Linda school district one million a year we'll go to the U.S say oh there's a little\nSomething else since ... eleven why more has donated nearly fifty thousand dollars to the political campaigns of various members of the OC supervisors\nNow none of supervisors wanted to talk to me for this

Chinese traditional ecological knowledge at the University of Montana and she argues the loss of these languages means more than just losing the language itself we lose something important about our understanding of the natural world I spoke with her more about this recently via Skype\nYou say you're that that embedded\nIn indigenous languages is an ecological knowledge conservation methods described that for us what do you mean\nWell I Would argue that particular indigenous people especially people\nMore than just losing the language itself we lose something important about our understanding of the natural world I spoke with her more about this recently via Skype\nYou say you're that that embedded\nIn digital languages is an ecological knowledge conservation methods described that for us what do you mean\nWell I Would argue that particular indigenous people especially people who have lived in a particular um ecosystem our landscape for very long time have developed a knowledge base about that particular ecosystem are about that particular landscape\nAnd over time that particular knowledge and observation\nUm then gets embedded into their language where they can have very short words or phrases that can have\nA lot of information embedded in those short words or phrases because they're speaking about something um that they know about\n'em and have observed for a very very long time\nYeah give us an example or two\nI think I'll I'll give my youngest daughter's name as an example so my youngest daughter her name as you could see me skim Markey which that kind of sounds like a ... a long game\nBut it's a black seat name that contains a lot of information it is often translated as red shell\nWoman it describes a red show and then it ends with a key which means female but actually her name means\nA lot more than red shell um it's actually a is a particular type of freshwater muscle that lived in the Missouri River gear 'em both in Montana the Dakotas\nUm it's a particular show that the black we'd have used for very long time for religious purposes\nA show and then it ends with a key which means female but actually her name means a lot more than red show um it's actually a is a particular type of freshwater muscle that lived in the Missouri River here I'm both in Montana the Dakotas\nI must have particular show that the black we'd have used for a very long time for religious purposes\nUm it does have a particular color which is not necessarily read more salmon colored so anyway it kind of in Bedford in her name is\nInformation about this one particular type of freshwater muscle show and also uh information about how it is used\nUm because it's used for religious practice and then also um information about how um it is thought of in black feet cultural um practice\nSo let's talk about the translation aspect of this to to know if you let a team of experts and scholars elders or to create a lexicon I'm black feet words right and you talk about the word or but in this article and I want to talk a little bit about that example as well so\nHow is the definition of herb in Blackfoot um different than how we would think about it in English\nSo yeah so I was working with a group of elders and native language speakers on behalf of and with the national museum of natural history and they were interested in creating a list\nOf all of the materials that were in their museum that were black feet materials and they wanted them in the black sea language so from very simple things like you know what do you call a mock us and [laughter] right [laughter]\nAnd you know 'cause they have it markets and write written in English but what do the black sea call it and so one\nWith the national museum of natural history and they were interested in creating a list of all of the materials that were in their museum that were black feet materials and they wanted them in the black sea language so from very simple things like you know what do you call a mock us and [laughter] right [laughter]\nAnd you know 'cause they have it markets and write written in English but what do the black sea call it and so one of the things that kept coming up with the urban example is that basically anything that was a plant\nSpecies substance that was in the museum which is called an herb whereas it was different types of plants that were used for different things and so the blacks we had a broken down in greater detail it just always call a plant a plant 'em and so we started making lists of\nThe different species that they had and the museum and try to give it that greater detail the way I'm it would be thought about not only in kind of the language but thought about it and used in black feet culture and traditional ways\nYeah and it can mean more than like spice for food right it means it means often in your language like something that's medicine All right\n[noise] right one of the things that the black feet elder spoke about was um in certain cases where in English it may be translated as a word such as plant in black feet the word that they're using to describe it is not\nThat it is part of the natural world they described it more as a tool um that is being used for a particular purpose\nRight that means something very different okay so there are efforts here in Arizona and around the world and the country to to save native language is like this right to preserve them to teach them to the next generation but they almost seem like they're just\nTo describe it is not that it is part of the natural world they described it more as a tool um that is being used for a particular purpose\nRight that means something very different okay so there are efforts here in Arizona and around the world and the country to to save native language is like this right to preserve them to teach them to the next generation but they almost seem like they're disappearing too quickly to stop the bleeding for lack of a better phrase\nI I Wonder what you think can be done or what approaches you think might work to try to preserve this because it sounds like you think there's so much more being last year and then just in language\nYeah I think on the one and there are approaches such as documentation right just basic documentation\nI'm so that you're almost like ... you know creating information that then gets put into a library or an archives that people can go and find it later but the other approach um which I think is really successful in I'm In a lot of communities is teaching children the language\nThere are a lot of different schools and programs now across you know native North America that are working to uh teach children the language because really a language is lost when people stop speaking it it's not technically lost when people start\nDocumenting it right we continue to do do do those kinds of projects so you have to teach it to the next generation you think\nAbsolutely and I just teach but I mean they have to actually speak the language and it needs to be more than just inside of the classroom so it needs to become a return to being a language that spoke and within a community\nRight Roslyn appear is an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Montana Rosalyn thank you for coming on the show to talk to us about

does say um which is true of most elite colleges is that they consider\nThat children of people who went to Harvard at some kind of affiliation get a kind of closer look they get an extra read and you know they do get a small leg up\nUm and um and uh in terms of Asian Americans um they're you know this that the university denies that they're they're giving their penalizing Asian Americans\nI'm In the admissions process and this you know I think the what the point that they're trying to do in this case is to tie this question of are Asian Americans penalized views of the whites to our whites penalized visa vi I'm underrepresented minorities um\nI should say that you know there's a compelling ... in the end of the law there is a compelling state interest to give a boost to underrepresented minorities for this diverse learning environment\nThe Congress is not true between you know when we're comparing Asian Americans to whites and admissions\nWell when it comes to you because you just wrote a big piece about this in the New Yorker you interviewed several Asian an Asian American activists who actually are in support of the lawsuit can you give us a sense of why they feel that way why they stand there [noise] yeah I think there's a\nLot of division within the Asian American community and might not be as great as is often reported but there is a very small very vocal group within was Chinese American immigrant population that is very much\nWork or you interviewed several Asian an Asian American activists who actually are in support of the lawsuit can you give us a sense of why they feel that way why they stand there\n[noise] yeah I think there's a lot of division within the Asian American community and might not be as great as is often reported but there is a very small very vocal group within the Chinese American immigrant population that is very much invested in notions of opportunity meritocracy\nBut you know they also spoke about the American dream in a way that I think a lot of people who've been in America while don't necessarily sort of see his contract would binding and it just sort of this perfect storm Edward Blum is really interested in changing the cultural conversation around affirmative action around race consciousness and a lot of these\nPredominantly I Would say middle class I'm fairly kind of well to do single issue Chinese American voters particularly in suburban areas they don't really experience the diversity that a college campus might provide for them or you know they just see this as taking something away from them\nAnd are they right in that sense um I'm I'm curious a Natasha what do you think is it is it taking something away from the students as you said earlier that not everybody can get into Harvard right\n[noise] right and in fact very few people do get into Harvard and I think you know I think we have to be clear on what what we're talking about here it's I I think the evidence is very unclear about whether there is any kind of a penalty for Asian Americans I'm applying to Harvard you know they are\nUm age Americans who are admitted to have higher SATs present GPA's but you know that this is not how the university admit students of course right there are all of these other factors that I described and on you know on balance on all these other factors I'm white students seem to be stronger than Asian Americans and that's why you see this discrepancy\nIt kind of a penalty for Asian Americans I'm applying to Harvard you know they are\nUm aged Americans who are admitted do have higher SAT scores and GPA's but you know that this is not how the university admit students of course right there are all of these other factors that I described\nAnd on you know on balance on all these other factors I'm white students seem to be stronger than Asian Americans and that's why you see this discrepancy\nUm and I think you know the university um so you know for example athletic recruiting um there's that benefits white students over all students of color I'm and\nI'm so these legacy ... I'm like a seat boost as well and so and there are a whole host of other things like you know wanting representation from all fifty states of the country and of course people of color are concentrated on the coast\nSo you know then the question becomes a wire we kind of attacking affirmative action when there are these all these other policies that you know and are those fair that's a question that I think the university has to answer and shit you know is making decisions about furthering it's an it's kind of goals as a university um and ah\nI don't know that anyone has the rights to go to Harvard\nOut of the things that's been debated hotly in this affirmative action debate is you know who's having something taken away\nWell you you spoke to Edward Blum I'm I'm Wondering if there's been a lot he was also behind the Abigail Fisher a trial that um a lot of people might remember who was so young white woman who claim that she was the uh the victim if you will of of affirmative action\nIs Edward Blum really trying to help the Asian American community in your estimation your reporting or is he really using this as a as a pawn if you will in a broader strategy\nI'm a I guess I Would hesitate to say he's using them as a pong because a lot of the activists were already organizing like they were already organizing run issues coated missions and you know there is precedent for\nIn your estimation your reporting or is he really using this as a as a pawn if you will in a broader strategy\nI'm a I guess I Would hesitate to say he's using them as upon because a lot of the activists were already organizing like they were already organizing around issues of college admissions and you know there is precedent for elite institutions like Harvard\nOr you know tweaking admissions plans when it comes to Asian Americans in the eighties and nineties or a series of cases the D O G looked into\nSo it's not beyond question and I think bloom is tapping into this sense of paranoia he's giving a sort of larger narrative shape to a lot of the activism those already existing whether or not he actually cares I Can't really say but\nI think there's a there's a real I'm sort of synchronous in these interests that benefits both sides\n[noise] well what is Natasha Harvard says that getting rid of race um well you've already said that that that was over ... well Ming Li benefit white students is there a argument here for other things like looking at class which is often come up in affirmative action debates\nI absolutely you know I think that to me these are not either or right we should be able to think about underrepresented minority groups because of the history of racial exclusion in the United states\nBut we also need to do a lot better I'm In college admissions in class diversity you know these ah universities are predominantly serving well to do families\nAt you know admission to these places is higher than median household income in this country and while many students are on financial aid\nUm many you know of a an over representation of kids who are not on Senate financial aid so absolutely we need to do a lot more about class but I don't think that this has to be an either or I'm a question well\nI'm curious your reporting focused on Chinese uh image\nTo these places is higher than median household income in this country and while many students are on financial aid\nOn many you know I had over representation if it's not an angel eight so absolutely we need to do a lot more about class that I don't think that this has to be an either or I'm a question\nWell I'm curious your reporting focused on Chinese uh immigrant community and I'm Wondering we use we often use these terms Asian American and he knows et cetera to really um lumped together very distinct groups of people\nDo you think that this case is revealing anything about the limits of how we define quote unquote Asian Americans in the United states\nThat's a great question and I think we're starting to see some of that fracture because even within the Chinese American population I spend a lot of time with\nThere's a lot of differences in how they see the world and some sort of how I see the world how my parents all the world so I think a lot of it has to do with where you're getting your information or sort of what your social network is literally but also on line\nOr a lot of the folks I talked to just had a completely different inflection point in their political awakening than someone my age or or someone who had been a culture in the United states\nThat passionate worry go is an associate professor of education at Harvard University and why she was a staff writer for the New Yorker thanks to you both\nThanks for having me and that's ten to ...
