quote\nNative American tribes and express surprised and disappointed with the decision which is likely to be appealed it with me to give us more details with him applied off of the Texas Tribune who's been covering the story and I'm a first explain the Indian child welfare act to us and then has always been controversial\nThis has been a controversial why it was passed in Nineteen Seventy eight by Congress and the problem they were able to solve with the vast numbers of native children\nWho are being removed from their families in state welfare proceedings many people question whether those were legitimate proceedings whether there was a legitimate danger to the children who are being taken from their families and we've seen this law come up before a case actually made it to the Supreme Court in twenty Thirteen out of Oklahoma but\nThat case left of the law largely intact\nThe judge in this case is saying that the act discriminates against non Native Americans why is that considered to be a first aid\nWhat why does is it gives adoption preference to other native families they first want to hand over any child to biological family members of the same tribe than other members of the tribe and then as a last resort and\nOther Native American tribes before they had a child over to a person who's not native and and the aim of this is\nMaintaining tribal integrity and in general the integrity of Native American tribes [noise]\nThe argument made here by Texas and to other states is that that law elevates a child's race over their best interests that is instead of just considering who is the best family to properly cared for this child courts um in adoption proceedings have to consider what is the race of the family that's aiming to adopt a child\nGreedy and in general the integrity of Native American tribes [noise]\nThe argument made here by Texas and to other states is that that law elevates a child's race over their best interests that is instead of just considering who is the best family to properly cared for this child courts in adoption proceedings have to consider what is the race of the family that's aiming to adopt a child\nAnd as you've been response yet I mean clearly that\nAmerican communities would be on the opposite side of this can you give us an update on on where that stands right now with the reaction is to the ruling\nThere are several tribal leaders tribes that have involved himself in this case and they're shocked and devastated by this ruling they're they're saying they're going to do all they can legally to oppose it they're asking for us Stay for now they're going to appeal it and they've said that this ruling is is devastating to tribal communities\nI Wonder how much does this complicated adoption proceedings generally as relates to Native American children going forward\nAbout Thirteen hundred people um at last count were in in shelters\nHundred people um at last count were in in shelters\nI'm most of the

issue we'll talk about his health care reform where do you stand on the Affordable CARE Act in aspects of it you would change and other aspects you keep an effect\nWell this is actually the most important issue in a big difference between\nA Steve and myself I Want to protect the Affordable CARE Act I Want to make sure that millions of people don't get taken off of health care\nOf Paul Ryan Kevin McCarthy the Republicans in Congress as you know voted over and over and over again to repeal the Affordable CARE Act Steve during the course of this campaign has told numerous audiences that one of his top priorities is to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that would take millions of American off of\nHealth care I Want to protect people with preexisting conditions on one of the primary uh accomplishments of the Affordable CARE Act is it allowed people with preexisting conditions our loved ones or family members\nTo have be able to afford health care at the same price as as a ... any of us so protection\nNumerous audiences that one of his top priority is to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that would take millions of American off of health care I Want to protect people with preexisting conditions that's one of the primary uh accomplishments of the Affordable CARE Act is that a lot of people with preexisting conditions our loved ones are family members\nTo have be able to afford health care at the same price as as\nI any of us so protection of the Affordable CARE Act not repealing the Affordable CARE Act protecting with people with preexisting conditions I made a commitment that I won't take a dime from the pharmaceutical companies so that people have trust\nThat I'm going to advocate for them to reduce the cost of drugs I'm going to fight for the ability to re import drugs from places like Canada where it's so much less expensive\nSo that the the cost of healthcare goes down so health care advocacy fighting for the people in this community that's my experience I'm an advocate and that's a huge difference between Steven I see what she means you have to speak for yourself would you want to repeal the Affordable CARE Act or what do you think about pre existing conditions\nSure so I have to fact check or a little bit because I've never talked about repealing the Affordable CARE Act um in fact in the primary I had a primary Greg I got scared over that that I didn't talk about that so I have talked about trying to I'm\nTrying to move forward from the Affordable CARE Act and I think that's one of the problems is what this repeal and replace or\nOr strengthen the Affordable CARE Act has become an issue for both parties over semantics over solutions so when I've talked about and if you go to my website you'll see that putting ... people with preexisting conditions or to protect them is first and you know is tantamount to me and I'll tell you a little story about why because my mom\nHad preexisting conditions my dad was a solo\nSolo so business owner one employee my mom had preexisting conditions she couldn't get healthcare right after my twentieth birthday she died of a catastrophic\nSee that putting ... people with preexisting conditions or to protect them is first and you know is tantamount to me and I'll tell you a little story about why because my mom had preexisting conditions my dad was a solo\nCello sole business owner one employee my mom had preexisting conditions she couldn't get healthcare\nRight after my twentieth birthday she died of a catastrophic stroke and bankrupted my family and so\nI Know about preexisting conditions my plants strengthens Medicaid by give by making it more like education I give Medicaid money to the state our state is vastly different than a state like Vermont or a state like North Dakota right now we don't have the ability to run the Medicaid program and the way the best suits Arizona and\nMy plan allows that and that actually also has a virtuous effect because when we're on Medicaid ... smarter it actually freeze up more dollars for education that's the thing is I Want to make sure that our safety net is strong and viable and it's there for the people who need it\nUnfortunately Steve's being dishonest right now as we speak went speaking before Republican audiences thrown out the primary he said that he wanted to repeal the Affordable care we are we are seeing words though absolutely not Republicans that are in control of the house right now have voted over and over again\nTo repeal the Affordable CARE Act in his mailers that he sent out politically\nHe has said he wants to repeal the Affordable CARE Act I'd been consistent we need to stand up for the Affordable CARE Act that millions of people will stay on insurance and we will actually protect those who have pre existing conditions\nSo that they don't have to pay more for health insurance or have health insurance be unaffordable by putting them into things like high risk pools that let me tell you some medicate\nBecause I have some experience with medicate when I was mayor\nHealthcare leaders of the state of Arizona you know what they did they came to me they were frustrated by the Republican\nCharacter that millions of people will stay on insurance and we will actually protect those who have pre existing conditions so that they don't have to pay more for health insurance or have health insurance be unaffordable by putting them into things like high risk pools and let me tell you some medicate 'cause I have some experience with medicate when I was mayor\nHealthcare leaders of the state of Arizona you know what they did they came to me they were frustrated by the Republican legislature who wouldn't expand Medicaid in the state of Arizona and they asked us in Phoenix to pass an access to care ordinance that we could draw down those Medicaid dollars get our fair share of dollars in a bipartisan vote or council we did it\nOne of the problems is we the metric we're using is how many people have insurance not actually how many people have care and I imagine a gray has never been on Medicaid he has had a very very generous government run health care plan which is great\nBut he has no idea what people with Medicaid actually go through it is difficult if not impossible to get timely access\nMedicaid is a program that needs to be improved upon and that's what his plan does not do that\nThere's been a history interests of members of Congress who were opposed to quote unquote pork\nOr we're not interested in that's where they bring in projects to Arizona because it sort of went against their their particular point of view on this now considering there are other states to be competing with in the situation whether it's California or Texas how much do you think it's important for there to be economic discipline but at the same time Arizona getting certain projects\nA level playing field there's four hundred thirty five people in Congress and I expect that each one is going there with the you know with the best interests of their constituents in mind so when I go to Congress one of the benefits that the people

constituents in mind so when I go to Congress one of the benefits that the people see nine will have\nIs I Will most likely be on the house armed services committee and defense is a very important industry to not only our district but our state and our service members that are in harm's way as we speak so I Want to make sure I like the last administration that did seek restoration of hollowed out our military that put people at risk\nI Will make sure that the military supported that our troops have\nThe equipment and the training they need to accomplish the mission much of which happens to be done right here not only in CD nine it but also in Arizona and that's not because I'm trying to give pork to those folks I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do\nI'm further I Will also likely beyond the energy and Commerce Committee because of the health subcommittee again that controls energy controls communications and technology Congress manufacturing and trade healthcare which

I chose five themes that represent American history in my mind into help us understand American history and the five five themes or freedom war innovation diversity and landscape\nSo tell me about this site in Arizona you select the admissions on Javier south of Tucson yeah what do you make that one of the great American places that people should visit\nWell it addresses a number of other important issues in my opinion first of all the architecture is as a magnificent ... not only the exterior but the interior was ... and how well preserved the interior of the mission is quite remarkable and and\nUh makes it one of the uh the great landmarks of that period of that time and I think the story that represents is the story of the Spanish uh settlements or and\nMy opinion first of all the architecture is as a magnificent ... not only the exterior but the interior of his ... and how well preserved the interior of the mission is quite remarkable and and\nUh makes it a one of the uh the great landmarks of that period of that time\nAnd I think the story that represents is the story of the Spanish uh settlements or in a what we now call the southwest of the legacy of father Keno who began in the late the seventeenth century\nAnd not continue to establish missions until his death in the early Eighteen century and then the Jesuit the contributions of him that he represents\nUm and then the um the whole relationship between the Spanish and the Native Americans of of that region um and then I think the efforts to preserve the mission in the last more than a century ever since the late\nNineteen century it's been one of the great preservation projects so or on a number of levels I think\nThis uh this mission uh qualifies as a great American place\nI Wonder if part of the byproducts of this book is to get people maybe talking in the beating a little bit about some of those that you chose to include on the list of fifty grand American places maybe some that you left off\nIs they're sort of hope that this will spur discussion about what really are in different people's minds the places that everybody should see\n[noise] absolutely I I this is not a definitive list it's a fifth the great American places not the fifth the greatest American places and I think it's a great point\nThat I Hope people will question my selections and challenge my decision and then come up with their own list um because American history is very rich and diverse even though we are relatively young country I I did include\nI I this is not a definitive list it's a fifth grade American places not the ... the greatest American places and I think it's a great point\nThat I Hope people will question my selections and challenge\nMy decision and then come up with their own list um because American history is very rich and diverse even though we are relatively young country I I did it includes a to pre colonial a sites but I I think that we have so many different ways of telling\nThe story of American history but ... most important I Hope people are curious to know more uh each essay that I ... in the book is only a thousand words and that's not the last word on on each one of these sites and I think that in a democracy we have to have people who know our history\nDo you think that Americans know nothing understand enough about our own history\nI don't I I think the statistics are very discouraging to see how little people know about our history and how how superficial that knowledge is\nAnd I'm not sure exactly the best way to to change that but if you look at any of the statistics about or even the teaching of history and and secondary schools and colleges and universities\nThe emphasis is much more now on stem education science technology\nEngineering and mathematics and there's nothing wrong with that but to me to be well\nGrounded individual and to understand the story behind the newspaper headlines or or the radio broadcasts on the on the news you hear on the radio or see on TV you have to have some understanding of the historical context for each one of these stories\nDo you think of a book like this might maybe be sort of an alternative way to help change that as opposed to you know people sitting in a classroom\nWell and to understand the story behind the newspaper headlines or or the radio broadcasts on the on the news you hear on the radio or see on TV you have to have some understanding of the historical context for each one of these stories\nWell do you think of a book like this might maybe be sort of an alternative way to help change that as opposed to you know people sitting in a classroom or you know watching a video on line they can read this book and maybe even visited some of the sites and try to mitigate some of those ... from\nYes I Do I actually had people tell me that this is clearly an introduction to American history\nBut it's a way to for people to go out with their friends or their family or their their classmates and actually see inexperience these historic places\nAnd perhaps get more curious and read more um and visit other historic places and come up with her own list but the main purpose is to engage people in the understanding of what we ... the discipline of history\nAnd why we consider places worthy of of further study unworthy of preservation and

Nineteen and beyond goes from and the idea of\nEssentially putting someone in a better position because we simply we're using old data than they would have been under the guidelines seems to me to be anathema to the basic premise\nOkay it's a little complicated but the because water orders for twenty Nineteen are higher than the numbers they had been working from ... saying that\nThe farmers are not in real terms going to be losing as\nMuch water as we think they will he's saying maybe the other groups don't need to mitigate the now farmers as much as we thought I Would imagine that canal

points from various constituencies and I'm from various agencies and I said so I think that that creates an opportunity for diverse stakeholders to weigh in\nIn terms of what makes them different you know I wouldn't dare speculate on exactly why as secretary think he is supportive of this and that withdraw Yellowstone\nVersus the Grand Canyon um but the obvious differences one is in his home state and one is not and there are some consistency there around I his decision making and interests um when it comes to Montana and they're you know a handful of examples of that\nUm and it's understandable but I think it is disappointing in the context of positioning the administration appropriately when\nIt comes to development and your national parks\nSo I guess in the scheme of things how big of a when you use this for a group like yours I mean this is obviously not legislation it's not necessarily a permanent solution um how significant do think it is\nI I mean I I Do not want to underestimate um or undervalue the work it takes to do this it's a terrific way and I think it sends a really strong signal I'm most importantly perhaps to mining industry that interested in pursuing efforts like this\nAnd while we haven't seen we did not see the same support\nFrom the administration when it comes to the Grand Canyon I think the Supreme Court spoke loud and clear about whether or not they value the withdrawal\nSo through one way or another I think that the consistency with which at least in these cases were saying you know mining near national parks is not okay I think in that way it's a it's a huge way and I think there is more to lose\nIn this case if we weren't able to maintain that\nGrand Canyon I think the Supreme Court spoke loud and clear about whether or not they

successful\nDo you anticipate the yours and other groups will try to push to make this permanent in some way\nYes most definitely Twenty years those fast I'm In the world of public lands and and we've been really happy I'm to be supportive of the legislation that's in both the house of representatives and and and the Senate\nFrom Mr tester in the Senate and of course from Mr Gen forte in the house

general mark Berger ditch has spoken out about the need for charter school reform in recent months there are calls from both sides of the aisle for charter schools to be more transparent about their finances at the same conflict of interest ... laws the district schools already do\nThose reactions came after reporting from the Arizona Republic Craig Harris that uncovered insider deals that have allowed charter school hours to make millions\nAnd this month a new report from the office of the inspector general for the department of education highlighted Arizona for having the highest number of charter schools closed down so Howard charter schools responding our co hosts Lauren ... sat down with Eileen Sigmund president and CEO of the Arizona charter schools association\nSigmund says she they hear the criticism that are taking it very seriously\nWhat kinds of financial transparency issues are you open to addressing right now there than many calls to increase that kind of transparency especially\nSure ah what we're doing right now is we're we're certainly talking with our charter leaders daily with policymakers at the Capitol with an attorney general with\nThe governor's office and what we're looking at some areas we're looking at is transparent financial issues or the governing boards of our charters and then working with that state agency that regulates are charters right now they're in the middle of doing their own making\nAnd we're working with them to make sure that they understand the severe mismanagement and have the proper tools to address those enclosed schools that are severely financially mismanaged when it comes\nI mean as we're looking at is transparent financial issues or the governing boards of our charters and I'm working with the state agency that regulates are charters right now they're in the middle of doing the rulemaking\nAnd we're working with them to make sure that they understand the severe mismanagement and have the proper tools to address those enclosed schools that are severely financially mismanaged\nWhen it comes to school closures that seems like something that needs to be addressed the office of the inspector general at the department of education just released a report that highlighted Arizona as having the highest number of clothes charter schools from the same school authorize or what are the the procedures now for closing a charter school here and do you think they need to be changed\nWell it certainly knows that that report lagged a couple of years and what happened is in twenty ten charter schools came up for their first reviews and then in twenty twelve twenty Thirteen and twenty fourteen and\nThere was a number of schools that either were closed or surrendered their charters which are considered closures and the main reason there was the academic accountability there was also operational accountability\nThere was a lag as we changed tests and we changed our letter grades than you saw in twenty Seventeen we received a letter grades\nAll afraid of charters were either told you are going to close or you're going to improve\nAnd in twenty Eighteen none of those charters were afraid it and you don't see that with our district schools because they can fail or students urine and you're out our charter simply cannot because our charters are different\nThey also receive more public money per student than district schools\nThough right now that's actually incorrect if you look at all sources of funding from the joint legislative budget\nAre charters on average receive nine hundred and fifty one dollars less per child and the reason is is that we don't have any access to property taxes which are that considered local sources of funding because our charters don't have boundaries we only receive stay\nThey also receive more public money per student than district schools\nThere right now that's actually incorrect if you look at all sources of funding from the joint legislative budget\nAre charters on average receive nine hundred and fifty one dollars less per child and the reason is is that we don't have any access to property taxes which are that considered local sources of funding because our charters don't have boundaries we only receive state dollars not access to any of the local property taxes which are about two billion annually\nTo thing you can't go for a bond or an override something like that that district schools often do to try and supplement funding but he isn't that why state funding is a little higher for charter schools per student that is\nAnd then for example there was also about a hundred and twenty million and a buckets for teachers that are charters simply can't access even though we fall into the same rules and regulations and we all agree that will finance has broken and we need to look at school finance because in Maricopa County\nOne out of two families exercise choice by either open and rolling or attending a charter school what do you think should change so we lost updated school finance in Nineteen eighty when we had one fax machine and all the state government\nNow what we're looking out as we should be focusing on students needs not systems needs and I'm moving forward in an overhaul to\nKeep pace with a robust movement of our students because we still are harkening back to a time when we had set closed district boundaries instead of this porous environment that policymakers ... enacted and families have utilized\nYou you're saying essentially that the state money should follow the students absolutely\nI Want to talk more about the oversight accountability changes you mentioned theater working with state lawmakers and the governor's office to change so a state senator Kate Brophy Mickey has said she's uncomfortable with him the nepotism that's exist on charter boards in particular we're hearing this also from the Republican candidate for superintendent of public instruction\nYou

play the reason why it's so hard to find affordable housing\nWell let's also talk about um what the current administration's stance is when it comes to public housing I'm thinking specifically about Ben Carson\nA HUD secretary who are essentially ... did a twenty Fifteen rule that require communities that receive Hod funding make an effort to integrate their neighborhoods where does that stance\nIn the Nineteen fifties and the Nineteen sixties there was a wave of white flight to the suburbs\nAnd what you have now is a county that is mostly white and in the city it's pretty much

actually out there and some of these places\nWell you know it really depends on which town do you go to there are some that are know very well preserved and you know they'll be whether they're managed by the bureau of land management or and or some other you know sometimes with nonprofits that kind of maintain these places and keep them looking good and everything or for profit places the kind of run them as sort of a tourist attraction\nUm in other cases you know these are and Dolby buildings that were built in late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds and they're just sort of fading

I think in a lot of\nWays it's just being able to stand in the places where these people stood where they worked where the I mean obviously not go down into the mine but um this is where a house used to be this is where the schoolhouse was or maybe still is in some cases\nAnd I think it's interesting because one of the things I found interesting while I was going around all these towns is that a lot of our reporting in Arizona highways is about places like ... and Jerome and places that were these mining towns but then had to reinvent themselves when the mines went blast\nAnd they've been

other mining towns I mean literally hundreds of smaller mining towns in Arizona that weren't so lucky and just sort of faded away when the minds that petered out so it's really good reminder I think of this part of Arizona's history that maybe we don't think about so much\nSo you mentioned that in some of these ghost towns there are a nonprofit are for profit entities that are maintaining them and working to to preserve them how big of a draw or those places for tourists I mean and can for profits make money on on people coming to visit them\nUh you know there are some there is one in particular down in southern Arizona called ruby that's privately owned and you know they charge admission to to get in that one I feel like they can make money because it's very well preserved and there's a lot of buildings to see and people can go down there and make you know a day of it\nUm and some of the other ones there either so remote ... or ... or there's just not that much to see so it wouldn't really make sense to charge admission to go and see them wanting one I'm thinking of in particular is called swamps the it's out in a western Arizona kind of by by Parker and it's at the end

said earlier it's just a part of Arizona's history that you don't think about so much I mean you think of ghost towns and you think of places that everyone who lived there is that basically um and it was interesting after this story came out we got an email from a woman who had lived in ... which is one of the ghost towns we featured in the magazine\nShe lived there in the Nineteen fifties which was sort of sort of toward the end of its its run as a mining town\nYou know she had all these memories that she shared about um they have this stone schoolhouse where you know just as one room schoolhouse and every week the postmaster would come up from Prescott with a truckload of books um and then they would those will be their books for the week and then when they were done with those you know bringing new load and bring the old books back to Prescott so\nYou know it's just interesting to hear about you know I think we forget a lot of times I mean obviously most of these places don't have anyone living in them anymore so there's no one there to tell those stories so I just think it's a good\nReminder of you know the states passed and the other thing we forget is Arizona is a very young state compared with uh with some of the state's back east or what have you so this is not like ancient history it's you know in in a lot of cases these towns existed fifty or a hundred years ago so\nWhat's interesting that you mentioned that there was a woman in one of these towns who live there not\nI think for some of them I think there's there's sort of this cache of living in a
