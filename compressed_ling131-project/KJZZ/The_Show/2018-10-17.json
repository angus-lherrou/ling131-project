other's record on health care and we ask ... will show to look into how those stack up with reality he will\nHey mark so how have the candidates been talking about health care and did any of that change it all at the debate they both clearly realize\nIt's one of the top issues for voters in the election and after all many of the issues that crops up during the debate over the Affordable CARE Act really hung around for years and years and elections are there's a lawsuit going on right now brought by Texas that threatening key protections and the law for preexisting conditions\nArizona as part of that uh meanwhile people have memories of the geo peas or multiple failed efforts to repeal the CIA especially last year or so on the campaign trail both candidates have acknowledge problems with the law I mean even send them out who was a big promoter of the CIA or she's been emphasizing\nThe attacks on it and trying to hammer home the message that you should be worried about your insurance if Republicans when what about my salad\nMix Sally like many Republicans this election has been a bit more on the defense she's having to explain her votes\nAnd why she believes that she's the right person to fix it here's what she said that Tuesday's debate\nCannot go back to where we were before Obamacare where people or one diagnosis away from going thank\nOn the message that you should be worried about your insurance if Republicans when what about my salad mix Sally like many Republicans as election has been a bit more on the defense she's having to explain her votes and why she believes that she's the right person to fix it here's what she said that Tuesday's debate\nWe cannot go back to where we were before Obamacare where people or one diagnosis away from going bankrupt because they could not get access to health care\nSo here are obviously she's aware that voters support at least some of the principles of the law namely protections for pre existing conditions\nA that was not it you know a word or phrase that was really in the vernacular very much until the AC a and now people expect that I'm so she's not promising a wholesale repeal anymore or it will so what did cinemas say about and they sell his record than she pointed to ... vote for the American health care act\nAnd that was in may last year the major ... that was a major piece of GOP legislation that was passed by the house or to repeal the CIA\nWhen my vote as last chair to repeal existing law it whatever lemonade at the protections for people who live with preexisting conditions in our country today\nAnd that makes Sally responded to as a she called it a flat out why ... so we do do we know what's accurate here like almost any of these issues market requires a bit more contacts than the debate a soundbite and for that I turn to ASU professor swap and already\nWho studies health policy she says it's true the legislation did prevent insurers from denying coverage because of a preexisting condition\nWhile you could not be rejected for health insurance based on ...\nIt was possible for insurers actually charging more based on your past or current how bad it which is actually very different than what you for double ... says\nSo even if technically insurers cannot deny you coverage under\nShe did prevent insurers from denying coverage because of a preexisting condition\nWhile you could not be rejected for health insurance based on ...\nIt was possible for insurers actually charging more based on your past or current how bad it which is actually very different than what you for double ... says\nSo even if technically insurers cannot deny you coverage under the law already says you know are under the proposal Reddy says it could have become unaffordable okay let's do another here here's what makes Sally said about the marketplace at Arizona\nAnd the premiums going up over a hundred percent year to year there's so many people right now if ... they can't get access to health care because Obamacare model doesn't work\nSo here make Sally is talking about the individual marketplace it it appears\nI'm only around five percent of people are so actually use that for insurance but he gets a lot of attention or several years ago Arizona had big problems with its marketplace there were very few insurers willing to offer coverage\nAnd for the twenty Seventeen plans are withdrawn sailing twenty sixteen rates in some cases did go up to you know a hundred and sixteen percent\nUh but now the story is very different I spoke with Dr Dan Dirksen with the University of Arizona and here's what he said about the marketplace this year\nSo we had that big jump that one year and then the following year the premiums stayed the same and in this year we're seeing a indications that there'll be more insurers offering players in the marketplace the premiums will overall premiums will go down\nSo actually Arizona this year you know has one of the more robust markets and there's really corrected many of the issues that were partly just related to under pricing of plans also it's worth noting that consumers get tax credits so many were insulated from the steep hikes\nAnd now that said you know there's still a portion of people um who get insurance on this\nMarketplace their premiums will overall premiums will go down\nSo actually Arizona this year you know has one of the more robust markets and there's really corrected many of the issues that were partly just related to under pricing of plans also it's worth noting that consumers get tax credits so many were insulated from the steep hikes\nAnd now that said you know there's still a portion of people um who get insurance on this marketplace who have trouble affording it it's not an issue of pre existing conditions\nKind of which is what makes Sally implied in her in her bite there but it's really because of their income level you know how these subsidies work\nAnd maybe they have just hide such high deductibles for their family they don't see the insurance it's helpful um but again the A. C. A. has lots of things like requirements for what benefits health plan must offer\nAnd those ... touch far more people in the marketplace does but what's clear from the numbers we have is that many more people have insurance now the uninsured rate was nearly twenty percent before the AC a in Arizona where the highest in the country\nAnd now it's closer to ten percent\n[noise] All right that's ...

least a new shade of purple\nIn twenty sixteen the group one Arizona aimed to get more than one hundred thousand of those voters registered but after election day their effect appeared underwhelming this year they just announced they registered one hundred and Ninety thousand new voters\nBut a new political analysis shows there is an enthusiasm gap that Latinos rated themselves less likely to show up to the polls in both white and black voters but that's not what Edward Vargas has found he is a senior analyst for Latino decisions a Latino focus pulling and research firm\nWhich just released a new statewide poll of Arizona's within over sampling of Latinos I spoke with him more about it recently and asked him about this enthusiasm gap is that what he found\nActually could we find the opposite luck to you know we have we record some of the highest levels of interest in this election attention to politics and really anger and frustration over Trump's policies among Latinos\nSo I don't want to start the conversation for people to ... says by the voters are more that they are not paying attention does that's incorrect\nAnd you actually found in this survey that more than half of Latino voters you surveyed have yet to be contacted via campaign or a party group out of the mid term so do you think that the conversation should be sort of flipped like is the onus instead on these on the parties on the candidates to reach out to these voters\nRight the oldest is definitely on the candidates to come in and earn our vote the candidates have to come into the community and talk to the people that need to talk to people who regularly do not vote who and convince them to vote 'em there is a strong belief by some up you know just the political system is not respond\nLike

made us head of the national Medicaid program and the children's health insurance program also known as chip\nPreviously may who served as Maine's health commissioner overseeing the state Medicaid program\nBut throughout her tenure she's led efforts to prevent Medicaid expansion championing narrow were eligibility standards and leaving fewer people with access to coverage here\nTo talk about what Mayes appointment means is damn dime into health care reporter for Politico so let's talk a little bit about may use history with Medicaid in Maine what were some of the reforms that she put in place specifically that restricted um access to medicate me\nUnder Paula page a longtime ally of Donald Trump he's the main governor worked to cut down eligibility for main residents to sign up for Medicaid what that means is\nFolks who had incomes that previously were able to qualify for Medicaid that threshold was lowered she also rolled back eligibility for drug\nOr subsidies for elderly patients and at the same time did other reforms to the food stamp program as a result there were thousands and thousands of people about eighty thousand people in fact on Medicaid\nWho moved off the program while she was in charge her defenders would say that's great she was getting people off of a steep program she was reducing spending but her critics and that includes many patient advocates that I've spoken with would say that she put vulnerable patients further at risk and loser\nArms to the food stamp program as a result there were thousands and thousands of people about eighty thousand people in fact on Medicaid\nWho moved off the program while she was in charge her defenders would say that's great she was getting people off of a state program she was reducing spending but her critics and that includes many patient advocates that I've spoken with would say that she put vulnerable patients\nFurther at risk and those are arguments that I think we keep hearing now she takes us other Washington what about manners headed painters or take to that decision\nI don't think they liked it very much you could see that both on the popular opinion polls about what was happening in Maine as well as the fact that ... herself ran for governor this year she finished third in the Republican primary cast herself as a successor to Paula page\nThe measures that they point to tens of measures like hunger went up while a long way he was even rolling back the food stamp program and that's the kind of tension that has really concerned the advocates on the ground that I've spoken to and\nWhat are we the nationally because that she's overseeing Medicaid nationally do you think she'll be able to implement those types of restrictions\nAt the national level it's telling to look at both which she has set in the past as well as what the Trump Administration has already put in place so I was reading a letter that me who sent to the Trump Administration about a year and a half ago she laid out all of the things that she wanted in Maine\nHer wish list included work apartments for Medicaid beneficiaries essentially but healthy adults would have to get a job or or show that they were pursuing one she wanted to set lifetime limits of five years\nFive years on on total Medicaid eligibility and she wanted Medicaid beneficiaries to pay some premiums now that she's in this job should be receiving those sorts of applications from people across the nation from state Medicaid directors and she will be in position to either expedite them forward were pushed back there are people in the Trump Administration of similar views\nTo show that they were pursuing one she wanted to set lifetime limits of five years\nFive years on on total Medicaid eligibility and she wanted Medicaid beneficiaries to pay\nSome premiums now that she's in this job she'll be receiving those sorts of applications from people across the nation from state Medicaid directors and she will be in position to either expedite them forward were pushed back\nThere are people in the Trump Administration have similar views to make you or current boss women seem of Irma has also been very receptive to these sorts of requests but the fact that they have added mate you will make it easier to move them forward\nAnd are there briefly are there concerns about the chip program as well\n[noise] the children's health insurance program as is tied up in this to the fact that there are funding issues for that program have generally been patched over by lawmakers in both parties but there is significant fear and may he will look for ways to cut that is too\nDamn diamond is a reporter for Politico covering health care under the Trump Administration Dan thanks so much for being with us

part of people's diets\nAnd any time there's a concern with it it's alarming to us and um this was a very a large outbreak can and certainly very a tragic situation as it relates to all those that were uh you know or or affected\nSo I Know that there are some new practices in procedures that have been put in place since then what to you are the most important ones do you think the ones that will be most impactful\nWell we haven't had an extremely complete investigation or all of us are still waiting for the the wrap up on the FDA investigation and they're they're the leads on that\nUm but even before FDA really showed up on the ground here and in Arizona those of us in the industry were working together a working with scientists from an extension at the University of Arizona\nAnd are working with some of the best and brightest minds and food safety and we were trying to figure out what was going on amongst ourselves not having the benefit of all the information from CDC and and that sort of thing but we're working on all the all the aspects top to bottom front to back or trying to discern what had happened\nAnd these pathogens um whether they be Colo and five seven eight

it out of them but and pundits caution\nA series of pieces of rope hanging over streets were green spaces\nThat's the idea behind a proposal called jak Iran to avenue from uh Phoenix architectural firm it was a competition entry from a couple of years ago and envisions the structure is covering first avenue in downtown Phoenix between roughly Washington and Roosevelt I met with the two guys behind the\nKnow island in Phoenix but here's one you probably haven't thought of\nA series of pieces of rope hanging over streets were green spaces that's the idea behind a proposal called Jagger rented avenue from uh Phoenix architectural firm it was a competition entry from a couple of years ago and envisions the structure is covering first avenue in downtown Phoenix between roughly Washington and Roosevelt\nI met with the two guys behind the idea on first avenue just north of Monroe Matthew ... is an architect with blank studio design and architecture Samuel Martin is a project manager there and I started our conversation by asking me ask you about the pairs vision for what the area could look like\nWe were taking the the attack of looking at what the what the city needs most then obviously shade and and comfort is is certainly one of the things we're lacking here so what are proposals are seeks to to accomplish is provide these long extended\nPublic avenues of predominantly dabbled shade and new open pedestrian places for the for the city to congregate\nAnd you would be hanging row which is not something that I think a lot of people would think of when they consider what could produce shade here what would it look like right well I mean you can see the the\nOf it on our on our website et cetera and sort of see the visuals of it\nBut I Know that the idea is to create something that has a dabbled light I think one of the process these when when we designed as we use\nWord play we use terminology we use narrative so one word we happened to come across during the design of this process was a was a Japanese word called ... which described the dabbled elimination of sunlight underneath the tree canopy and there's something remarkably adoptive just about that a lot that word so we're playing on that and said how can we create\nSoft apple shade how can we create something that is\nOrganic it's movable if not static it's not hard shadow but it's something that just feels natural like a natural tree escape so we hit on the idea of rope and right up the street right behind as we have the gentleman artwork that is you know it's a rope artwork\nUnderneath a tree canopy and there was something remarkably adoptive just about that a lot that words so we're planning on that and said how can we create soft dabbled shade how can we create something that is\nOrganic gets movable if not static it's not a hard shadow but it's something that just feels natural like a natural tree escape so we hit on the idea of rope and right up the street right behind us we have the gentleman artwork that is you know so it's a rope artwork piece that has been established on the site and has been here for a significant amount of time and we said that's that's probably the play\nAnd so we did it with these dangling a individual sheets of rope\nSamuel what's the allure of this particular kind of shade I mean we are standing in the shade of a building right now there's some trees just on the other side of the sidewalk here what's the lure of the kind of jihad that you're proposing here as opposed to everything else that we have\nI think the shade takes its relevance from a couple of insight like Matthew said it's an\nOrganic moving element in the city and we see already in Phoenix so many metal structure it's whether they're attached to buildings are free standing\nOn introductions their infrastructure and while that is an excellent job other scaring the heat and unfortunately doesn't excellent job of rewriting that heat rating that heat\nBack to the streets skate sub benefits in this I saw is that it's a mass so it's going to absorb and slowly re radiate that later in the evening rather than kind of metaphor of a cookie sheet they get with metal Feisal additionally as a regional material it's actually comes from the ... plant\nEssentially the leaves in front of that plant are ground up and dried and ... and interrupts comes from our region of this place and we think creates an enjoyable experience for the people of the places well\nYou're also talking about taking out the street you're right I mean first avenue would not be a thing anymore how big of an impediment do you think having the street here is I mean would you want to do this with the street here\nThey think that in terms of the implementation of an idea as grand as something like that\n... to ... comes from our region it's up this place and we think creates an enjoyable experience for the people of the places well\nYou're also talking about taking out the street here right I mean first avenue would not be a thing anymore how big of an impediment do you think having the street here is I mean would you want to do this with the street here\nThey think that in terms of the implementation of an idea as grand as something like jak grand avenue there's different extent to which the project could be implemented whether in places first avenue remains the cars are still below that can be as above just provides an element of reducing the thermal effects of ... in the city\nOr in places the street is removed we can have urban parks capes we can start to restore some of the annoying habitat\nThat we're so used to seeing outside of Phoenix urban proper endemic doesn't have to completely replace first avenue it creates moments of reprieve from our very wide automotive driven street tapes\nAnd Matthew in theory having less asphalt and more grass or landscape\nCould potentially make things a little bit cooler resent a significant component of your proposal here yeah that that I mean that that really is the second leg of of the whole proposal is I mean providing the shade\nAnd knocking down the initial heat is is is step one but if you removing the ... the mass of ah of what's making below you in replace that then with vegetation I mean to you again having multiple layers of sort of softening in cooling going affects\nPeople will be frustrated with potentially closing off a strip of street it happens is happening\nIn cities all over the world you know for a very good reasons for whether it's um\nFor the intensity of traffic and those areas primarily that's not necessarily an issue we have here but we have an overabundance of lame\nAre there other places that have done anything even close to what you guys are proposing if not exactly you know hanging roof over urban area for doing anything like that well not exactly I mean\nIs testing it with with doing a large coverage a shaded spaces um but that's really\nFor the intensity of traffic and those are is primarily that's not necessarily an issue we have here but we have an over abundance of lame\nMore there are other places that have done anything even close to what you guys are proposing if not exactly you know hanging roof over urban area but doing anything like that\nWell not exactly I mean Vegas is testing it with with doing a large coverage shaded spaces um but that's really the only step so far I mean the the the two step of\nBoth adding the shade and then removing the mast and creating public space below it is something I think we're we're coddling together ideas from different places and trying to bring it together into one universal idea\nSamuel how realistic is this idea I mean it sounds like a pretty big proposition you're I mean is it possible that this could actually happen\nI think a really interesting precedent to look to as the high line and part of the success of the high line\nIn New York City was I took advantage of existing infrastructure the highland wasn't being used for real trends that are the transportation of the goods anymore so I had a purpose that needed to be reuse\nPhoenix is such a small and young city and such a city that has now seen eventually now the return of people to the urban streets gave we don't have that infrastructure to use so we have to interject\nSomething much like the people who first came here and said you know this could be a really lovely place to live most of the time and I think that we're in terms of replacing the automobile the goal is never to her completely replaced oddly the worst city where you have to drive\nThe light rail is continuing to be more readily used more readily available\nReceiver limited production of jak rent a concept as redirecting these the transit to mass transit things like around the ... local district traffic and delivery is certainly replacing the street it's making a very\nMessy if you think of this kind of concept could be used in other maybe smaller rations in other parts of the valley where they're also\nLooking to shape things and maybe cool things down especially during the summer yeah I I I think absolutely you know and we've\nGot grand concepts as redirecting these the transit to mass transit things like around the ... local district traffic and deliveries start really replacing the street it's making a very\nMessy if you think of this kind of concept could be used in other maybe smaller rations in other parts of the valley where they're also\nLooking to shape things and maybe cool things down especially during the summer yeah I I I think absolutely you know and we've been we've been pitching it to to different places trying to find a some different opportunities for a let's call them um proof of concept that kind of thing um but but I Know it can absolutely apply but I think it's true\nIt's true purpose is really about creating community in creating a place where\nPeople gather and that's the heart of this city is what the city doesn't have is what we really needed that is why we feel it belongs here despite the inconvenience of of losing the traffic lanes I think we're not losing streets were gaining community center\nFor this to actually get bills I mean I Can't imagine you're just snap your fingers in this sort of thing happens I Would imagine there's a bunch of stuff do you have to go through\nThere are so many stakeholders when it comes to these large infrastructure scale projects and I think it's really important when people begin conceiving of how we want to shape the future of the next we start preparing for things like the driverless car which we've seen in Tempe some of the city's port initiatives that are looking to our streets going to change\nAnd it's about imagining preferable futures opportunities where we can kind of all grow together as we have different technologies that are hand just\nTrying to the general description of of of the impression that this thing almost feeling like just a uh being in in a in a grassy plane and you're seeing tall grasses sort of waving now just flip that up over your head and imagine that overhead I mean there's something really really\nWonderful and exciting I think about that experience and I and I think that's something that people will be a engaged with and be excited to come and
