to the mall because in the summertime you don't have to park and walk a million miles and hundred and twenty degrees heat\nAnd at Christmas Time you don't have to find a place to park you just step out of the car and wherever you want to be and you can shop your way through them all and when you get to the other end you just step out to whatever that Curtis and called the\nWay Mel again Adams is one of the early writers she signed up to be in the early adopters for this burgeoning technology and she says for her and her husband was a matter of convenience more than anything else\nOriginally we found it because the announcement to sign up early writers was on the computer one morning and my husband said you want to do this this sounds like fun and I went\nNo cache um we had um at that point we had three three of us my my my youngest son and the two of us and we only had two cars and so it was\nSometimes got a little dicey about that and we thought oh well this will give us another car another opportunity and also um we're just so fascinated by the technology\nWhat do your friends think what are the other people in your life I think are people like completely flabbergasted by the fact that you do this or what was the reaction\nUm they always want to see it you know what what what what do you do and will you walk up to it and you press the button and you can [laughter] but everyone's just you know that they're just like in my book club they all want to go outside and see me get in the way\nAnd also um we're just so fascinated by the technology\nWhat do your friends think what are the other people in your life I think are people like completely flabbergasted by the fact that you do this or what was the reaction\nAnd they always want to see it you know what what what what do you do and will you walk up to it and you press the button and you can [laughter] but everyone's just you know they're they're just like in my book club they all want to go outside and see me get in the way most [laughter]\nBut self driving cars have a long way to go before everyone is ready to jump in and take a ride in March the public perception of the technology had a massive set back when an a ton of his ... vehicle hit and killed attempt the woman who was crossing the street at night since then the company ended its self driving operations and testing here in the valley\nSo ... is slowly rolling out its technology here and focusing on safety but its cars have been driving on public roads here for some time now in fact today the company announced its vehicles have officially driven ten million miles on public roads many of them right here in Arizona\nAnd I got to check out how it all works at their Chandler facilities product manager climate right just showed me around the Chrysler Pacifica mini van\nSupposed to take a look towards the front of the car and you can see these little spinning gray lidar so do you let us use lasers to see things that are near the car like smaller people or a ball that might be rolling under the car we also have radar that wants to see how far away things are and how fast they're moving\nAnd then the cameras on top right you're right a thing you can actually recognize if you see the car driving\nHer and yeah you see the big black dome on top so that has camera in it which was to see a high definition and in color so we can see a you know what color traffic light as we know when we can go and there's also long range the lidar up at the top and that lets see up to three football fields in all directions and detect objects that are coming\nSo what else is there that's distinct about this\nThing you can actually recognize if you see the car driving her\nAnd yeah you see the big a black dome on top so that has camera in it which lets us see a high definition and in color so we can see a you know what color traffic light as we know when we can go and there's also long range the lidar up at the top and that let's just see up to three football fields in all directions and detect objects that are coming\nSo what else is is there that distinct about this\nSo yeah let's just take a look inside and you can see some of the other things that differentiates us\nSee we have a child she in the back for any of our early writers who ah why not take a child along and we can fit a three adults\nWe also have our test drivers are sitting in front of you and say Hi to them [noise] and so you can see\nOn the back of the driver's seat had rest and the uh front passenger she had rest we have passenger screen so these let to use or know what's going on so they're telling us to close the doors a fastener seatbelts and then start\nAt my door and then I\nTake a look up here I'm a console with a few different buttons\nAnd want is help buttons that contacts\nAre rider support team um there's also a lock on locked door button a button to pull over if you want to do that and then nice big blue button to start the right\nSo if if I were in the early writer program and it comes to my house that pick me up I get in the back seat or the middle seat here and one of the pilots are these two nice gentleman in the front or is this no one's in the ...\nIn some of our rights we do have known in the front seat we do have a test drivers in in our rights as well\nOkay so that's like a like a like a mind then for a lot of people right how do you how do you address that with people or the people who are signing up excited about that\nUm they're really excited and I think ah once we get riding we'll see how the passenger screens help tell the story of what the car is perceiving and thinking and planning to do next and that does a lot to help people feel more comfortable with oh at the car knows what's going to do you want to get going yeah it was do you want to go ahead and press a start right one\nAnd um then beating system couldn't keep up last winter and one parent had to go and pick his child up early from school so it's in it's in rough shape and the issue is that they don't have\nTheir there just isn't a tax base there it's it's very low they don't have a lot of income coming in so they don't have resources to pour into this\nOld facility let's talk a little bit about um race and how the demographics of the schools are playing into what you saw down their shirt so what I found in my reporting is that in Mississippi this is this happen has happened across the state [noise] forty nine of a hundred and forty five school districts\nAre more than three quarters African American Nineteen districts are more than three quarters white um so the schools there have re segregated in in a big way and this is particularly true in Yahoo city where in Nineteen Seventy I'm black students entered white schools for the first time\nAnd they're\nAfter that period\nWhite students started going to private school or they moved out to ... county and the school district there now is Ninety eight percent black\nThe schools there have re segregated in in a big way and this is particularly true in Yahoo city where in Nineteen Seventy I'm black students entered white schools for the first time\nThey're after that period\nWhite students started going to private school or they moved out to ... county and the school district there now is Ninety eight percent black\nAnd if you look across the state of Mississippi none of the districts that are more than three quarters black R rated a or B none of the districts that are more than three quarters white R. Rated the were asked the gravity of the situation cannot be overstated\nNow is that you mentioned that the tax base but is that really the only reason why the schools are where are you seeing the discrepancies in these schools is that only financial what else is driving this\nSo there's there's a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center and it was filed in twenty Seventeen it's on hold right now I'm actually a judge in Mississippi [noise] decided that\nThe state of Mississippi couldn't be sued over this but I'm the lawsuit is against the state and it says that it still has a separate and unequal school system that that there are differences between the quality of education there is a difference between the quality of education\nThat black students are receiving end of quality of education that white students are receiving teacher retention quality of facilities\nUm income plays into all of this\n[noise] now you spoke to the districts new superintendent and the person's name

superintendent in four years which indicates to me and not just instability but what's what's happening there\nIt's definitely a is definitely an unstable situation and when a district\nGets poor marks year after year after year it's very hard to retain a leader but what you know local folks were saying is that they need someone to stick around they need someone to stay and implement a plan\nSao recliner as a federal politics reporter for the center for Public Integrity Sarah thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me a ... at the take away [noise]\nBelieve it or not retailers are already thinking about the holiday shopping season and experts say this year's could be bigger than last which means those companies are looking to hire more workers this year\nWith me if he has got to talk about that is on a surf and Smith with the national Retail Federation and out of what kind of hiring are your members looking to do as we head into the holiday shopping season\nThis moment retailers are looking to hire and almost every single category possible whether its customer service representative on the phone or like at a call center or even in storage to sales representative folks that are stocking the shelves on an or where\nThe Retail Federation and out of what kind of hiring are your members looking to do as we head into the holiday shopping season\nYet this moment retailers are looking to hire and almost every single category possible whether its customer service representative of the phone or like at a call center\nOr even in storage to sales representatives folks that are stocking up the shelves um an or warehouse of employees and I were ... patient centered\nThose jobs very as well it could be anything from managing to make sure the inventory is correct and it through and everything is ready to go in the warehouse to making sure that things are shipping on time and sometimes even on some jobs that are heavy lifting they can't picking up those heavy boxes and make sure they're in the trucks ready to go to\nShip out gifts to everyone's lovely homes or to ship out item going back into the store so there's a lot there's a lot of jobs open right now is that a lot of people applying for these job\nWhy is that [noise]\nYou know the market is very very tight right down the retail industry is just one of many industries that are feeling this at this moment reason being is that there's a lot of very low unemployment rate there for those that are unemployed at this moment\nHave either some of the skill sets are not all of the skill sets that some of these industries including retail industry is looking for [laughter] so that's what makes it a little bit difficult for us to find the right people to come in to the job that we're looking for especially when it comes to seasonal hiring\nUm but one of the things that we are on scene in the industry that most retailers are doing right now is getting very competitive in regards to their packages to bringing 'em to attract the talent necessary to have them come and work at the stores are work at their warehouse distribution centers um or call centers\nHow does the hiring that retailers are looking to do this year compared to the last few years in terms of hiring [noise] so\nA scene in the industry that most retailers are doing right now is getting very competitive regards to their packages to bringing 'em to attract the talent necessary to have them come and work at their stores or work at their warehouse distribution centers on or call centers\nHow does the hiring that retailers are looking to do this year compared to the last few years in terms of hiring\n[noise] so this year we expect retail jobs to increase between five Seventy five and six and six hundred and five thousand jobs during the holiday season um that is an increase from last year where we saw a total of five hundred and forty five thousand jobs\nDuring seasonal hiring I'm In that perspective we're looking for more people this year given the fact that we know that there's going to be a lot more people shopping I'm In a lot more people line to spend more deaths holiday season\nBut in other ways that it differs is the fact that these benefits that um we're seeing retailers offer four one K. packages depending on the position um we're seeing them offer paid time off for seasonal employees which is something that we've never heard of before and then naturally increase in wages\nHow much of the increase in hiring for the holiday season and the overall sales for the holiday season do you think can be attributed to the fact of the holiday season itself seems to be getting longer and longer I mean I'm not going to name the store but\nI was in a store recently installed Christmas trees and it's you know the second week of October of ... I Wonder if it's a true apples to apples comparison year over year when it seems like each year the holiday shopping season seems like it's getting longer and longer\nYou know one of the tactics that were seen retailers to this area is that the second biggest shopping season it back to school and so they have a huge recruitment period at that moment to bring on seasonal workers for the summer but\nHi and thank you for listening to ... audio service which is supported by creating university preparing students for careers with programs including undergraduate graduate and professional schools learn how Creighton alumni become leaders in communities worldwide at Creighton dot edu school\nAnd so they have a huge recruitment period at that moment to bring on seasonal workers for the summer but\nOne of the things that we saw this year and it was different from years past is that they are now looking into extending the higher end\nOf the season employees to go all the way through the holiday season so for those customers that are looking to shop as early as August\nWhich there are um retailers than are offering you know an aisle or to or a couple of shows here and there was holiday to core and holiday gift ideas so these folks can start checking off those items from their lists\nI Want to ask you about something that you brought up earlier about a warehouse jobs and in store jobs I'm Wondering if you can glean any information from which of those maybe retailers are really looking to hire\nIn terms of how people are shopping be they go into a store and and walk out which which item or if they just order it online\nKnow one of the things that um we heard from a lot of retailers this year is that they're going to be heavily promoting them and pushing by on line picking up and store\nReason being is because it's a cost savings for on you know not having to use the UPS side acts or us PS ship items out which is an expense for the retailer as well as a consumer and it saves them so seasons some money to use their own trucks from aware how center to go into the store\nAnd because of this hush of buying online picking up and start it's actually having done look into employing about at the same level of warehouse jobs with in store job they now are\nA PS two ship items out which is an expense for the retailer as well as a consumer and saves them so season some money to use their own trucks from aware how center to go into the store\nAnd because of this hush of buying online picking up and start it's actually\nHaving done look into employing about at the same level of warehouse jobs with in store jobs they now are creating dishes that are just exclusively for by on line pick up and store\nWith the in store experience so that way when you walk into the store you have a section where there's two or three representatives from the store\nComing in and checking you in grabbing your you know you're tied number that you purchase something on line and that you're picking up historic ran in and for you and you can move on 'em and not having\nTo wait in the long lines from the regular self checkout or check out areas or have to actually Santa customer service return line which during the holidays as we all know can sometimes be pre tedious [noise]\nUm so they are getting really creative in regards to these jobs and as what we're seeing right now is that it's going to be a good mix of numbers for both warehouse and in store um employees\nAll right that's on a surf and Smith with the national Retail Federation ... thanks a lot for talking about ... thank you for having me\nGood Wednesday morning to you you are listening to the show here on ...

a bus and then continue following that threat so do we know how many families have been released by ice no we don't\nUh based on our reporting talking with sources et cetera we know what's in the hundreds here in Arizona is this just a lack of detention space so there are other factors that are that are leading to this\nWhen I was released a statement on Monday they didn't say anything about not having enough space to put these people in detention they just said that they were doing this to stay in line with a decades old court settlement known as the floor is agreement which limits the amount of time kids can spend it attention I Believe it's twenty days\nAh but in the in the last since mid August uh we know that border patrol has been finding large groups of undocumented people in

giving it thirty percent rebate on the amount of money that is spent in state for production it's really hard to be able to fight that I'm the one of the founders of the Phoenix film festival I produced some films myself and if I had a budgets I Would not be filming in Arizona\n[noise] do you think it's too late for Arizona I mean if the state were to decide okay we want to do an incentive

thwarted\nSo do you think there's any hope for I mean ... are you guys gonna keep pushing\nUh I think the thing is that you you know you can't get a hit until you get up to bat so you have to keep on

now\nThere's one shot of downtown because it's for buildings and there's no way you can actually say oh this is a thriving downtown in Chicago when you're filming in New Mexico as opposed to Phoenix in Arizona when you're talking about to Phoenix being six hour drive or an hour flight you know go up to ours and you've got pine trees and snow\nOr go south and you've got sand dunes over in

going to be getting a lot of calls from angry and Mexicans at the moment based on that description I'm curious if though let's say Arizona does approve an incentive\nHas New Mexico sort of entrenched itself enough at this point with Netflix and with the other stuff that has done that Arizona could still draw business here I think there will be a lot of business that would come but the thing about Arizona is that it's kind of locked right now because there has been no\nDevelopments in the internal operations of film you know the uh Albuquerque studios basically you know there was a group of

of clerk magistrates it's completely different\nIn this hearing clerk magistrate has to decide whether a case will proceed I'm and basically whether a charge will issue for a defendant and these aren't in an open court room generally they're in a private conference room they have little public notice and if the magistrate decides the case won't proceed\nThe cases completely closed how do people\nGet into this court system versus our traditional quote unquote traditional court system how do you end up here within\nMassachusetts have you been accused of a misdemeanor but you haven't been arrested a police officer can usually set up a clerk magistrate hearing like this sometimes defense attorneys and know that this extra layer actually exist so they'll divert case into a secret here and\nI'm just wondering if this is in Massachusetts but is there anything else like this and the rest of the country so we asked officials and prosecutors from every\nState and so many of them all and then actually hadn't heard of something like this in general these kinds of hearings like a preliminary hearing right before I missed me or they don't really exist in many other states the prosecutor is the one that's deciding whether to charge or not if not some court official ...\nWe know of course the criminal justice system does have its own discrepancies or when it comes to race

if you're an investor ended up here as well as I've heard of anything like that the world is\nYou're probably going to engage more with world work in the future of them that if you were\nLeaning point of view isn't shared by our next guest Arthur quarter wagon associate professor in finance and economics at the University of Southern California he said no and potential benefit of investing in art is diversifying your investment portfolio\nIf you if you approach is purely financial investments which is what this would be since you're not having it on your wall um you could still earn a lot of money right so there are certainly examples of paintings that were bought for a certain amount and sold for multiple send them out a few years later\nI'm sort of certainly a potential that you could earn a lot of money\nAnd of course it cuts both ways you could also uh end up uh not making any money\nLet's talk about the risks him this knowing how the how the investment art world\nMy right so there are certainly examples of paintings that were bought for a certain amount and sold for multiples of that amount to a few years later\nI'm sort of certainly a potential that you could earn a lot of money\nAnd of course it cuts both ways you could also uh end up uh not making any ... who's\nSo let's talk about the risks in style in how the how the investment our world works in general I these smart investment from your point of view\nThere are certainly large risks to investing in an art or so and individual painting ten go up and down in value quite a lot because well what really determines the value of painting right and and in many ways that isn't the eye of the beholder and\nIf a certain art style or a certain paint or sort of artists it isn't swaying um their values for the artworks couldn't go up astronomically [noise] um but if the style or dispenser or this artist say I ah goes out of style than the values can drop quite a bit as well\nWho sets those prices I guess I mean at the art world is a little ... for the sort of arbitrary subjective prices but where do they come from typically\nPaintings and an an other art pieces are sold at auction so and it's really the people that show up at these auctions that decide how much they're willing to pay for a certain piece of art that more dry ... individuals in in in value in these pieces can be extremely\nOpaque right there is not really in\n... in many ways the intrinsic value as one would say for for a painting\nMight not be very large right it's a piece a canvas and a bunch of ... and that's about it so it's really is about what is the static value of the peace what is ... how much to somebody like looking at it and also what do they think they can sell it for the next time\nThat would be extremely opaque right there is not really an\n... in many ways intrinsic value as one would say for for painting might not be very large right is that he's a canvas and a bunch of pain and that's about it so it's really is about what is your static value of the peace or just how much to somebody like looking at it\nAnd also what do they think they can sell it for the next time when the tickets washing\nRight and there's no really predicting that that that intangible element in this round\nRight because it's like when you look at fashion you know sort of like ... what's going to be ... springs color so I find that [laughter] so it's very hard to foresee what styles are going to be popular what what's dollar suit platform\nSo with a platform like master works with the risk it all be mitigated because you're only investing a smaller amount of money and then somebody who would only entire Andy Warhol for example is that mitigate it in any way\nI'm certainly helps because you can take a smaller risky you know you lose the money that you invest I'd say if you invest twenty dollars your maximum losses twenty dollars if you have to cough up twenty billion while them loose the ultimate ... now it's not likely that you will lose the full\nAmount that you invest so unless the painting goes up in flames but hopefully insurance and things like that\nRight and and when you talk about the art world and investing in art minor you are talking about this world that has been entirely off limits to most people in general right because\nUm I work of art can cost twenty million dollars or a hundred million dollars is this a real way though do you think for people to regular people quote unquote to break into that world or is this sort of\nGoing to remain a world that is exclusive\nI think it's some it's an interesting proposition that potentially could open up this world for as you say regular people but you have to be careful that it is very low pay and it is very hot\nMillion dollars is this a railway though do you think for people to regular people quote unquote to break into that world where is this sort of\nGoing to remain a world that is exclusive\n[noise] I think it's some it's an interesting proposition that potentially could open up this world for as you say regular people but you have to be careful that\nIt is very low pay and it is very hard to figure out what is a good investments\nAnd how do you fix to pieces\nAnd hopefully part of ... master rich we do is take some of that work out of your house and they pick the paintings\nAnd they got paid for that of course and I would I Would certainly suggest that people do their homework before they\nGet their money into something like this the auction house gets somewhere between twelve to up to twenty five thirty percent of the of the purchase price but painting and and then their insurance or storage costs all these things that that has to be paid\nIn your view it sounds like you don't think that for somebody who's not going to be investing a lot of money in the ... the best place to put your money\nIf you're going to invest in arts and you don't have ten million dollars sending her out one way to do it is to\nActually buy smaller pieces that are cheaper and you can go to a gallery pick something up there that you really like\nYou get to put it on your wall and you get a little bit of that value from actually looking at it\nThat so I think that's that's one way to go if you're in it and you just want to make money considering sort of outsourcing this to professionals who do to picking and not taking a huge monetary risk by bussing the smaller about could be attractive\nTo have an art funds that have been around for about a decade or so experience of those those those are
