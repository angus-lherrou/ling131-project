Ninety One point five with Steve ... here in Phoenix coming up this hour how any use growth has caused some growing pains for Flagstaff and we'll look back on a football league that just didn't quite make it\nBut first the latest us unemployment numbers are out this morning and the basic figures look very good the unemployment rate is down to three point seven percent the lowest in nearly fifty years but as everyone benefiting what about wages and how many people have given up on the job market with me to talk about all that as David Wessel of the Brookings Institution\nDavid the numbers seem like something to get excited about how significant are there\nI think it means something significant pianist\nMake it but first the latest us unemployment numbers are out this morning and the basic figures look very good the unemployment rate is down to three point seven percent the lowest in nearly fifty years but as everyone benefiting what about wages and how many people have given up on the job market with me to talk about all of that is David Wessel of the Brookings Institution\nDavid the numbers seem like something to get excited about but how significant are they\nI think it means something significant the unemployment rate isn't a perfect measure but it's a very good measure of how tight the job market is and this tells us that the job market is getting better and better but it's an incomplete measure\nWhat are the most important factors in deciding that in fact the job market is getting better I Know certainly the numbers tell us that but what about those who have stopped looking for a job do we still have to or they're still a lot of folks that are like that\nYes but if you look at all the measures that the government has\nA the number of people who are looking for a job and say they can't find one the number of people who say they're no longer looking 'cause they're discouraged the fraction of people who are working part time but wish they could work fulltime if you look at all the numbers they're all pointing in the same direction\nSo I think it's a it's realistic to say the job market is getting better it's not good for everybody but it's getting better the one thing that's missing and the real puzzle here is\nOrdinarily economic textbooks tell us that you would see wages going up now and the reason that people are kind of puzzled is that ... there's a wages aren't rising very much particularly when you compare them to the rate of inflation\nAnd that's a a signal that everything is not well and everything is not functioning exactly of the textbooks tell us that we'll\nWe'll just that indicate the type of jobs than we are talking about or is it something deeper these are we talking about lower skilled low wage jobs there was some other factor\nIs both things but I think in general\n... there's a wages aren't rising very much particularly when you compare them to the rate of inflation and that's a a signal that everything is not well and everything is not functioning exactly as the textbooks tell us that we'll\nWe'll just that indicate that type of jobs then we're talking about or is it something deeper because are we talking about lower skilled low wage jobs or is there some other factor\nIs both things I but I think in general if you look at all the different ways measures they're all sending the same signal wages are creeping up\nFinally but they're not going up nearly as fast as you would expect given all the other measures of the job market are all these things you're hearing about employers now there are some signs for instance Amazon saying it's raising the minimum wage in its facilities to Fifteen dollars an hour and stuff like that so there are some signs that wages are beginning to go up\nBut it's been a real puzzle as to why this hasn't happened sooner\nAll ride Reihan Salam is the author of the book melting pot or civil war\nAll ride right on so long as the author the book melting pot or civil war aside of immigrants makes the case against open borders round thank you for that conversation thanks for having me Steve\n[noise]\nEvery year as debate about building a wall along our southern border and comprehensive immigration reform continues in Washington hundreds of migrants continue to die in the desert as they attempt to come to the U.S\nThere is a community of activists in southern Arizona work to help those migrants groups like Samaritans and no more deaths who have water along the trails were undocumented migrants sometimes cross\nJodi Upton is part of that community and for more than a decade she and a group of other artists and activists have taken some of what those migrants leave behind closed blankets sometimes prayer cards and turn it all into quilts\nIt's called the migrant quilt project and it's going to document the migrants named an unnamed to die every year in the Tucson border patrol sector of the desert there are Seventeen quilts now that serves a tribute to migrants who died there over the last Seventeen years our coast Laurent yogurt spoke with tips and more about the project and why she started it to begin with\nIt's interesting because in two thousand five I was\nUp in and watch you come mountains that porters ah Arizona and the Mexico border and it was hiking up there with an old boyfriend of mine and we camped for several days and I came across a website or campsite and there were baby bottles and diapers and backpacks and\nFree holy cans and garlic and and I was\nFive I was up in and watch you come out and supporters uh Arizona and the Mexico border and it was hiking up there with an old boyfriend of mine and we camped for several days and I came across a website or campsite and there were baby bottles and diapers and backpacks and\nFree holy can ... and I'm garlic and and I was at first really appalled by the destruction of the beautiful pristine desert\nBut toward the end of the week and I was so curious to\nTo understand why these people were crossing especially with children are babies so I grew more and more compassionate throughout the weekend and when I headed home I got involved in a humane borders and then ... and no more deaths and I\nReally wanted to fully understand the root causes some migration why people were coming and uh it was in two thousand seven that I took a trip a throughout Central America Mexico\nBefore leaving on that trip I cut out newspaper articles from the Arizona Daily Star and the citizen and recorded and documented these stories um where these women came from that had died in the desert\nAnd I mapped him out a on a big map and a a friend of mine who\nBecame the um translator for me on that one month journey joined me and we started in El Salvador and literally backpack through out\nOf Salvador Honduras Guatemala and then through the veins of Mexico all the way up to soccer take is and what I discovered in these small little villages was intense poverty\nI could not and see what I saw there and it ...\nOne month journey joined me and we started in El Salvador and literally backpack throughout\nSalvador Honduras Guatemala and then through the veins of Mexico all the way up to soccer take is and what I discovered in these small little villages was intense poverty\nI could not and see what I saw there and it moved me in such a way that I just felt powerless but at the same time like there's something I've got to be able to do about the deaths in the desert\nAnd um ... what happened was at the end of that trip I came back and I was still involved with the border issues and hiking migrant chosen they decided instead of throwing away these things that we would come across\nUm you know to clean up the desert I Would somehow you some of the fabric\nAnd create quilts documenting the lives of the migrants who died in the Tucson sector [noise]\nAh so let's talk a little bit about what these look like so this is radio so we can't see these quilts but I've seen pictures of them and they're quite stunning can you describe one or two of these for audience said that they can understand what it is that the final product ends up looking like\nSure uh one quilt that looks like an American flag was actually a blanket that I had found in the Tucson sector area and it was really more and you can see the sun damage on it and everything and a woman named Bernie Greenfield created a flag out of that fabric\nAnd on that particular quilt you see this\nLike highway or car Tara where people would walk north into the mountain region and then the red and white lines that represent the U.S fly or the white lines contain all the names of the migrants who've died in the desert it's a really powerful quilt\nCreated a flag out of that fabric and on that particular quote you see that as like high where ... where people would walk north into the mountain region and then\nThe red and white lines that represent the U.S fly or the white lines contain all the names of the migrants who've died in the desert it's a really powerful quilt because\nIt represents the United states but it also represents why people are coming to the U.S and there's another quote that I Want us to talk about because it's very emotional and it was created by Cornelia Bailey who is in green valley she's a phenomenal artist quilter\nActivists and um\nShe pieces together the names of people with groceries and in the law grows which are little metal trinkets that represent body parts or hearts and things like that that are very precious to the Mexican culture\nAnd I'm One of her quilt she hand stitched did you see a bird that day you died real hot thirsty and frightened\nAnd that gets to me every time I read that and\nIt's just so compelling about how people lose their lives out in the desert in these remote areas all alone by themselves and and just how frightening that must be to them I Wonder if you've ever shared\nThis project with some uh some people from the migrant community people who have made that journey\nUm recently we were in ... Illinois in fact the show is still up until October fourteenth [noise] one of the gentleman who was there whoa sway Perseus to see is he noticed his cousin on one of the quotes and um his name is ... Perseus\nJaime ... is used to live in Waukegan and worked for the\nPeople who have made that journey um recently we were in ... in Illinois in fact the show is still up until October fourteenth one of the gentleman who was there a way because he is to see is he noticed his cousin on one of the quotes and um\nHis name is ... ... is\nJaime ... used to live in Waukegan and worked for the Park Service there and ah his green card expired and he was forced back into Mexico and um he decided to cross again to reunite with family and he did not make it\nAnd so it was really powerful to meet with some of his family members\nI Wonder when you travel with this with these quilts I Do show them to people who do not maybe no the border as well as we do here in Arizona What kind of reactions do you get from people is is um I think surprised\nAbsolutely almost everyone says\nI had no idea this was going on\nAnd that is almost universal response to the project because when you see Seventeen very large quilt some of them are nine feet long and you know six seven feet wide\nThey shutter at the number of does I'm On the quilts for example we just got the medical examiner's report for this last fiscal year and a hundred and twenty two migrants have died\nAnd almost all of them were on identified so when you see those numbers of identify human beings on these close to remain nameless ... just horrifying\nAh like we mentioned before the project has just a past it's ten year anniversary um why is it something that you are still doing\nFiscal year and a hundred and twenty two migrants have died and almost all of them were identified so when you see those numbers of identified human beings on these close to remain nameless ... just horrifying\nUh like we mentioned before the project has just passed it's ten year anniversary um why is it something that you are still doing and that you still feel needs to be done\nI'm Still involved in it because when I started volunteering to work out in the desert as humanitarian aid worker in two thousand five there was a lot of talk about humane immigration reform and you know pathway to citizenship\nAnd still here we are in twenty eight teams we have\nNo reform I mean there's no legislation on the table right now to pass to bring the ten million people out of the shadows and\nA path to citizenship or increasing the number of work visas people can come over and work in agriculture and other industries hum so until that happened until\nPeople aren't funneled into these remote areas through border policies like operation gatekeeper safeguarding hold the line we're going to continue she does every year or so we we have to continue to just talk about that is what's happening in our desert as long as people continue to die\nRight

needs to get to\nWin and President Obama obviously very very popular either but does it make a difference in a state like this\nUh you know I I think when you're in October and you're seeing a Republican endorsed a Republican or Democrat endorse a Democrat or the impact of that is just about zero uh [laughter] I Am very much a a\nA a a dog bites man story there's just no it's a it's a raw

ground at former Arizona Democratic Party chair odd richer guys let's move to Washington for just a minute and talk about\nArizona Senator Jeff flake role in really today what's happening to the cloture vote for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court last\nWeek on friday he said he was going to vote for Kavanaugh out of committee then kind of changed his mind a little bit to the extent that he uh requested and ultimately got a week long uh FBI a pause basically to allow the FBI to do a supplemental background check and wondering what you make of of flakes role in this and maybe how\nConsistent or inconsistent it is was sort of how he has done things over his nearly six years in the Senate\nI think Senator Flake is a thoughtful individual I think he does not take anything for granted I think he thinks through all of these items I mean it goes back to ... think tank days I think he's always been a member of the intelligence community when it comes to these types of items and I think he he thought it was a merited\nAnd so he decided that that's what he was going to call for things and people were shocked by that but\nUm overall he he marched to the beat of his own drama he's decided that he wasn't going to run for reelection early on and I think he's been taking full advantage of that and you know doing what he feels as\nAndre from the Democratic side it seems like after flake called for this pause there were some at least on the left are like oh maybe this means he's he's going to be a no on Capitol and seems like they really got their hopes I mean has it been kind of like a roller\nWere shocked by that but um overall he he marched to the beat of his own drama he's decided that he wasn't going to run for reelection early on and I think he's been taking full advantage of that and you know doing what he feels as\nBest Andre from the Democratic side it seems like after flake called for this pause there were some at least on the left are like oh maybe this means he is he's going to be a no on Capitol and seems like they really got their hopes I mean has it been kind of like a rollercoaster on the left when it comes to\nSort of how this nomination process has gone I think it's a little bit like a loose the what the football on a Charlie Brown\n[laughter] Democrats are always keep on a holding out hope that uh that things will be different but look I think if what Jeff Flake called for which is a\nUh FBI investigation or when you have a credible allegation of sexual assault by Supreme Court nominee if that count as a profile in courage in this day and age that's a sad indictment of the Republican Party and what happened over the past week is not even an entire week I FBI investigation that\nAre investigated things only to the extent that they didn't actually a question either of the two people who are involved in as a judge Kavanaugh or Dr Ford so uh just about as a fake of a fig leaf of investigation as you can possibly imagine\nA it's a sad state of affairs I think putting aside Democrat or Republican that state of affairs for our country when we have a decision\nOf this kind of magnitude being made of a Supreme Court justice one that's going to be a key Supreme Court seat for generations to come up with out a a deep look at what's going on without documents being produced without a time to be given to air these kinds of serious allegations\nUh it it really is a powerful indictment of what has happened to again the moral core of the Republican Party poll let's move on\nTo the political calculus of this because some speculators\nOf a Supreme Court justice one that's going to be a key Supreme Court seat for generations to come up with out a a deep look at what's going on without documents being produced without a time to be given to air these kinds of serious allegations\nUh it it really is a powerful indictment of what has happened to again the moral core of the Republican Party\nPaul let's move on to the political calculus of this because some speculate it seems farfetched but that Jeff lakes vote or the fact that he wanted to push this and have\nEven some sort of a small FBI investigation involved indicates that he is really ramping up he's been in New Hampshire a couple of times for the twenty twenty presidential race is is this the epitome of ... if he decides to do this\nBut I think it's a it's a difficult path especially depending on what he decides to do but every time he does so through an olive branch out there than someone shouts at I'm In an elevator or they bring The Handmaid's tale people out in front of his office that's not how you're going to convince center if like if you if we all remember you know\nA Sheriff Arpaio leveled serious allegations against flake and his family and he's been a you know the victim of that before so he is trying to be more thoughtful and give everybody\nCredence here but I think today based on his vote and what he said after the vote I think he's probably are yes and so I think that's a a nod to understanding that there is a Republican desire out there Republicans are energized on this if they wanted to run if he wanted to run for president or do something he would have to have this vote if you had any chance in a Republican primary Andres\nThis an issue the cabinet hearings taking out of the personal effects on a couple of people at least is this something that is wrapping up and ... both sides both the left and the right is this an issue that has gotten in both engaged\nOh absolutely I I think you see a not just Democrats but I I think you see I'm really especially women all over the country who are Americans apolitical who have been a stepping forward and\nPersonal effects on a couple of people at least is this something that is wrapping up at ... up both sides both the left and the right is this an issue that has gotten in both engaged Oh absolutely\nI I think you see are not just Democrats but I think you see I'm really especially women all over the country who are many times a political who have been a stepping forward and and seeing those really resonate with them and and and their stories and and and their lives\nUh and similarly I think it's very fair to say that on the Republican side\nUh you've seen a lot more energy from political standpoint or around uh the cabinet nomination uh and and certainly Donald Trump's comments at the rally the other night mocking a doctor for it I think just poured gasoline on that\nBut I think people are absolutely energize Republicans went into this thing I don't think\nA very energized and the longer it's gone on the more they feel how cabinets been treated they've been more energized Gorman to enter cc director set up this way he said Republican Party does three things cut taxes kill terrorists and confirmed judges we do those things we Energizer base and we also appeal to independent voters I really feel this confirmation has energized Republican\nI'm curious about that because we saw a poll this week from the NPR that showed that\nThe so called enthusiasm gap has really close that Republicans Paul to your point is have really sort of gotten energized early ballots in Arizona will be coming up pretty soon but it's still a politically speaking a good amount of time until election day let's assume for a minute that Kavanaugh is confirmed this weekend\nI'm Doug can Republicans maintain that enthusiasm up until election day I\nThink so because early voting is only about you know it's it's next Thursday so it's less than a week away now um we'll see how this goes this weekend a but folks that we're not paying attention or we're pretty much on the sidelines I've heard a lot more\nUntil election day let's assume for a minute that Kavanaugh is confirmed this weekend I'm ... can Republicans maintain that enthusiasm up until election day\nI I think so

pretty much on the sidelines I've heard a lot more energy than I still think uh the Democrat advantage in this election the blue wave is bigger\nBut it it instead of as as large as it could be ... I think this hearing a sort of backfired on Democrats they've gotten so far it up for it and really put it in to a production now both sides have let's be clear but that it it has the unintended consequences of energizing Republicans\nAll right that Jared McDonald evil an investigative reporter with Arizona mirror juror thanks a lot for your time appreciate it no problem thank you [noise]\nWell see if it is finally starting to cool off at least when you and I are\nWell see that it's finally starting to cool off at least when you and I are often Adam in the morning I shouldn't say this ... northeastern but actually start to feel like fall has arrived at this\nTime of year like just sit outside maybe a cup of tea and maybe a good book and I've got a stack of autumn reads I Would I Would hate to see that the recommendations and not really what you like I mean mysteries or biographies ... what do you think okay just just what if I Want a a novel that I can just sort of curl up with mark\nWell I mean there's so many they're just so many of them and if you're looking for some local reads\nYou can discover new authors tomorrow at the meet your literary community event\nAt Phoenix public market ... been with ...
