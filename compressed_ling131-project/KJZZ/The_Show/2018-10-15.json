Republic focused on a couple of Phoenix neighborhoods and tried to measure the impact\nOf government property lease excise tax or to put agreements with me to talk about the story he worked on his egg no Philip data reporter for the republic angle which neighborhoods did you focus on and why\nSo the two areas that we focused on we're basically defined by school district boundaries so are the main one uh it was Phoenix elementary which was basically downtown and a little bit beyond that\nI'm so in Phoenix elementary your tax bill includes Phoenix elementary is a tax rate Phoenix union high schools tax rate in Maricopa county's and all sorts of other things\nUm but we focus on those two areas because when we were going through our initial source of to to try and figure out what the impact was\nThis these two areas where the ones that stood out in terms of the highest impact so we we really wanted to focus on those parts and see what was going on there how is it affecting school districts how's affecting property owners what was the discussion around all of that\nWill suddenly really specific than we talk about the impact we're talking about the impact of with their schools are getting enough tax money that they're expected to get because property tax play such a big role in Arizona when it comes to that\nI'll start with the concerns so the concern was that this was reducing school district budget said it was someone negatively impacting the money they can actually spend and additionally raising people's taxes those are two somewhat incompatible um issues because and it turns out that the actual impact is to property owners less so to school districts\nSchool districts get the funding that they are statutory mandate and then allowed to again and they can raise that normally with or without these incentives what happens is because you take some of these properties by giving them a tax break they don't pay as much and property\nFrom the Esther manager surface

occur\nAfter the driest winter on record and uh luckily normal monsoon the twenty Eighteen wildfire season was mild but if more dry winters are to calm the current state of Arizona's ponderosa forests are tinderbox waiting for an errand spark Casey Kuhn kj easy news Flagstaff\nThis story is part of elemental covering sustainability a collaboration between public stations in the west and Casey Kuhn joins us now in Studio to talk a little more about the details of this ... so we heard of the story that the effort to send the force the forefront initiative to kind of a tough time getting going\nHe knows more about that and what's been going on to try to make it a little easier\nYeah so that's been an uphill battle for government officials to just get any of these trees out of the forest on the forest up in northern Arizona are now so densely crowded that the natural fire just can't find a way through and said it turns into those really destructive crown fires that spread quickly\nAnd that's a problem when the state's population keeps going up and development keeps happening right next to these wilderness areas\nI tried this Bruno ... is the interim conservation director at the Grand Canyon trust that's just one of the agencies working on this part of ... and he says that dense forest threatens those more remote communities\nHi I'm Heather ... thank you for listening to ... service which is supported by your part-time controller specializing in nonprofit accounting your part-time controller helps nonprofit organizations with all their accounting needs find out more at your part-time controller dot com\nThe Grand Canyon trust that's just one of the agencies working on this part of ... and he says that dense forest threatens those more remote communities\nWe're trying to spin out the forest and such a way to win a fire ... fire can come through but just not set the entire state of trees on fire and does not threaten homes because there's a barrier there where the where the forest is more open\nAnd it's not just those remote communities to because Flagstaff would definitely be affected for years and the case of a bad wildfire and at that nasty storm water runoff\nIn case you would think the logging industry would be ready to go for a contract shut down those trees make a profit it seems like a good deal for them but it's not really been the case why is that\nYeah that was my first thought was oh lugging its historical industry in Flagstaff um you can use those trees for paper or something I don't know that's not right though but I learned to up their reporting that these small ponderosa pines don't actually have a lot of value on the tree market or the market and\nThe old timber industry up their cut down the biggest trees that they could so that means that all that's left are the young smaller trees which don't use a lot of would which means that's not a lot of money to make so\nAdd to that the high cost of starting a timber business that's buying all the machinery I'm In the forest service can really only do so much on their own I also spoke to ... at the start of a project he manages the surface water there which the quality of which depends heavily on healthy forest\nAnd if you could reduce the costs of thinning ultimately you get to the point where profit is easier to be made by a company that come in and then before we got to drive that costs down so that it is easier to make money for doing it\nWe do so much on their own I also spoke to Charlie Esther at the sort of a project he manages the surface water there which the quality of which depends heavily on healthy forest\nAnd if you could reduce the costs of thinning ultimately you get to the point where profit is easier to be made by a company that come in and then before we got to drive that costs down so that it is easier to make money for doing it\nAnd some things that are doing to drive the cost down are implementing new technology to make it easier to figure out where to cut the trees down on so yes it's tough but there have been more than a hundred and eighty five thousand acres didn't already but that is a very tiny fraction of the two point four million acres in the forefront initiative as a whole\n... there's not a good market for all these trees where do\nThey end up going yeah I wondered that myself um there are actually more problems than just the amount of would that's a not valuable\nUm but so the initial costs are how high right but the season to harvest the trees also patchy lumber companies cannot actually harvests trees in the rain or this now with the mud is too muddy um and there's no operating in the dry months especially this year or like June and July they closed the forest down I'm so because they don't want to start a forest fire themselves a\nI don't do that there is no lumber mill in Flagstaff the closest one is in Phoenix so you'll have to take on shipping cost of the lung costs on I was told though the wood can be used to make like pilots um and wood chips also\nAh the forest service told me now they're working to develop a request for proposals on the next large scale mechanical treated in contract

Sullivan he is policy director for the clean energy for healthy Arizona campaign which supports the measure he's also senior scientist at the natural Resources Defense council and Andrew Clark state director for Americans for prosperity which opposes the initiative\nAnd Andrew let me start with you on this do you think Arizona's Kurt renewable energy standard is sufficient\nThe current system as a convoluted mess and there's no way to put that but you know it's it's the best of a bad set of circumstances so you've got rapidly changing economy right coal is becoming economically feasible we've obviously is kind of a lot on the Navajo generating station\nThat is set to close and and for good reasons\nNatural gas has become much cheaper and obviously that is expanding so there's infrastructure shift going on you see you know distributed utility systems rising to the use case solar is rising so you're seeing a lot of shift going on naturally in the marketplace and you know the the corporation commission I think does a\nAn okay job from time to time of trying to mandate or figure out how to adapt to that I think\nYou know look are are biased would always be to have more of a market based system where prices were driving more of those changes rather than mandates\nThis was going to create sixteen thousand new clean energy jobs\nAnd it's going to do that because instead of\nYou know building natural gas plants but then getting fuel from other states in perpetuity we're going to be doing this construction in Arizona and that's going to be creating Arizona jobs\nAnd yes there is going to be some portion of it about about twenty percent of the extra renewables that are going to be required under the ballot measure are going to come from distributed systems are but those are real jobs and you know the\nThe the utilities think that they've solved the problem in terms of whether or not they're subsidizing a individual customers to to do rooftop solar they don't think there's a there's a cost shift happening anymore so I I really don't think that's a that's a valid point and then also on on the cost is should we haven't really talked about that yet\nBut the cost of renewables is just cheaper than the things that utilities want to do\nAnd you can see that that's not just a stain it it's every recent solicitation that utilities in the region of done for new power and we've done a modeling of the entire electricity sector in Arizona and when we do that analysis we find\nThat you're going to save thirty three dollars a year on your electricity bill in in twenty thirty now\nThe cost of her new ... is just cheaper than the things that utilities want to do and you can see that that's not just a stain it it's every recent solicitation that utilities in the region have done for new power and we've done a modeling of the entire electricity sector in Arizona and when we do that analysis we find\nThat you're going to save thirty three dollars a year on your electricity bill in in twenty thirty now that's a modest savings but it's it's real savings to\nI Want to get to the issue of what the ultimate impact of this measure could be because as you both know earlier this year the legislature approved and the governor signed a law basically saying that a utility can ignore this mandate if it's passed and you know pay a one time fine of up to five thousand dollars so\nOn some level like are these arguments kind of spitting into the wind I mean even if it passes Andrew it sounds like a PS another ... don't have to follow this\n[noise] I mean I suspect that'll get litigated out quite a bit and so ah we don't know what the answer is on that one I think the reality is if it does come into into being caught part of the constitution\nAnd it takes effect where you're going to see your increase costs and so we can talk about all the reasons why those costs come in whether that's the new capital asked me invested to put rooftop solar on new capital asked me invested to build up power plants the distribution the batteries after we purchased there's a lot of upfront costs that are going to have to be buried in there\nAnd you get all sorts of situations against the law into the the biggest solar plants in the state has a micro burst it knocks the plant out are locked down to twenty percent capacity for several months that is not sustainable so then you have to have a backup piece of infrastructure anyways to support it so that we don't all have brown outs for two months\nSo you know why would you want to make the investment twice for one time return or you know that's going to be the net impact for the average consumer is they're going to see rising costs dealing does it concern you that even if voters approve\nIt has a micro burst it knocks the plant out are locked down to twenty percent capacity for several months that is just not sustainable so then you have to have a backup piece of infrastructure anyways to support it so that we don't all have brown outs for two months\nSo you know why would you want to make the investment twice for one time return or you know that's going to be the net impact for the average consumer is they're going to see rising costs building does it concern you that even if voters approve prop one twenty seven it might not matter because utilities can just ignore it\nWell let me first respond on costs because they think this is a really important issue that the key thing to understand on cost is that uh utilities are going to be building power plants whether or not proposition one twenty seven passes and the major utility in the state a PS has said that we're going to build a bunch of natural gas plants and when we do our analysis we find that\nBuilding renewables in the state makes more sense from a cost perspective it's going to save you money compared to that future that utilities want full stop\nSo you you talked about how spill two thousand five which is the bill that was passed in the legislature and signed by the governor\nAnd the governor admitted that he signed it basically to to try to nullify this this ballot measure first it's really hypocritical for utility that is that that is saying that we need to put all of his authority in the commission to remove their ability to to hold you accountable\nIf they don't comply with the ballot measure that that that that's one point a second even to send its own attorney said that the uh\nHospital two thousand five is unconstitutional the commission's attorneys think that a house for two thousand five is unconstitutional and it's it's going to be litigated or we think that the will of the voters is going to be respected\nAll right I think we're going to have to leave or right there Dylan solvent Andrew Clark thanks you both for coming in X revenue Dylan Sullivan is policy director for the clean energy for healthy Arizona campaign which supports prop one twenty seven he's also senior scientist at the natural Resources Defense council Andrew Clark is state director for Americans for prosperity\nStill and it's it's going to be litigated or we think that the will of the voters is going to be respected\nAll right I think we're going to have to leave or right there are still insolvent Andrew Clark thanks you both for coming in extra evidence\nDylan Sullivan is policy director for the clean energy for healthy Arizona campaign which supports prop one twenty seven he's also senior scientist at the natural Resources Defense council Andrew Clark is state director for Americans for prosperity which opposes prop one twenty seven\nAnd that fight over prop one twenty seven as some arrows at a politician's clamoring to make their opposition known but have some gone too far\nSome government agencies are facing claims they may have improperly used public resources to discourage voters from supporting the measure one of the places where this dispute is cropped up is the hours at a corporation commission which meets later this afternoon cage easy says we'll start has been reporting on the issue enjoy just will get more good morning Steve let's begin by talking about what's going on at the public utilities commission who did\nWhat corporation commissioner Andy Tobin is the subject of the allegation and at the moment it appears to be for something as simple as sending a press release last week Tobin who's one of the five commissioners issue to release the detailed his formal opposition to proposition went to seven which we've been discussing\nThat require half of Arizona's mix to come from ... like twenty thirty\nI'm token actually has his own noble energy plan at the commission so he wrote about why he feels that's a better approach and what he sees as gaps in the ballot measure but here's the thing that release came from the agency's press office and on the commission letterhead\nAnd within a day one of tokens counterparts commissioner Bob Burns had filed paperwork asking for the ... the commission to look into whether Tobin may have not only broken the commission's code of ethics but also state law by sending that\nThey'll get so well why would that be though it seems like the type of issue to expect a politician special one is overseeing energy is used to weigh it\nCertainly Steve it's it's definitely within their purview and you'd expect them during election season I to be saying\nA day one of tokens counterparts commissioner Bob Burns had filed paperwork asking for the ... the commission to look into whether Tobin may have not only broken the commission's code of ethics but also state law by sending that\nOkay so well why would that be though it seems like the type of issue to expect a politician specially when is overseeing energy is used to weigh it\nCertainly Steve it's it's definitely within their purview and you'd expect them during election season I to be saying these things but the issue is there is a state statute that says a public agency cannot spender used public resources to influence an election and that applies to ballot measures as well\nSo there would be no question if Tobin had just sent out to release a through a campaign or as private email address\nBut it seems he used some degree of public resources perhaps quite small we we don't really know to put this release out the context here is also important the commission you know has fend it off all sorts of\nAccusations of you know conflicts of interest and scandals over the years and so commissioner burns says you know the public distrust in itself as a compelling reason to look into this and so that's one of the items they will be taking up at their meeting this afternoon\nBut the commission is that the only place allegations like this that popped up right\nNo no I just last week as well or questions arose about several counties and towns doing a similar type of thing\nAnd that began with a group called the energy and Policy Institute which describes its mission as\nExposing attacks on renewable energy definitely anti ATS group up published a blog post that uncovered some emails that seems through public records on that show how a PS has lobbied some local governments to pass formal resolutions opposing the ballot measure which is ... backed by progressive California billionaire Tom's dire\nAnd we did our own research and it's true places like Greenland Healy counties did pass these resolutions basically to encourage their constituents not to support the measure\nAnd these came during formal meetings and you know again required some you\nIt's on that show how a PS has lobbied some local governments to pass formal resolution opposing the ballot measure which is ... backed by progressive California billionaire Tom's dire and we did our own research and it's true places like Greenland ... counties\nDid pass these resolutions basically to encourage their constituents not to support the measure\nAnd these came during formal meetings and you know again required some use the public resources\nAt what looks like we just have time for one more question do you have any sense of how likely it is they actually did violate the law\nIt's difficult to say without much more information it exactly you know what resources were used but to get a better spent sense I spoke with Joe ... who's a partner at ... bar and um this is what he said\nIf an elected official asset a press conference on government property you know whether they support or oppose the measure\nAnd the elected official offers an opinion on that I think the attorney general's said that that is not going to invoke this statute it's not going to be seen as a violation of the other hand if they if the county or city where to go a bit further\nYou know drafted a letter or and send it to every resident the jurisdiction explaining the city physician or the mayor council whoever you know offers that position but I think that would be too far\nSo you see this exist on a spectrum and could you know possibly run afoul of state law kj seizes Wilson well thanks thanks days\nBoth\n... good morning you are listening

writes through this\nAnd I spoke with them I started the conversation by asking how he would defined identity politics and whether he thinks that designation has grown dramatically in recent years\nThey're going to kind of a two species I guess of identity politics since the Nineteen sixties in the first phase identity politics was a way of mobilizing groups that had a common interest in order to demand writes through the political process\nIn the book I discussed the second kind of identity politics that has grown up since then\nAnd this identity politics is not so focused on achieving writes through political participation but rather achieving social recognition not only for groups of people but even for individuals\nAnd so it's much more personal and as I Would say rather than social and put a social and political\nAnd the identity politics of our time I Would say is more of a culture cultural politics than a political politics of Spain has strengthened individual groups well maybe weakening our common bond\nWell it's not so much a common bond with a ... a particular kind of common bond I Would say I'm In one hand\nOr these identity movements as a second sort have helped to make this a much more tolerance and open society that was before or my children are see different images on TV are comfortable with people that are different in the way that\nPeople my age I'm we're not\nBut in terms of the most important belonging political political and that is civic belonging I think it's had a terrible effect\nUh because uh whatever our individual and group identities there is a status that we all share and that is\nTrouble with people that are different in the way that people my age I'm we're not but in terms of the most important belonging political political and that is civic belonging I think it's had a terrible effect\nUh because uh whatever our individual and group identities\nThere is a status that we all share and that is citizenship and if we don't emphasize that the problem is that\nWe cannot get people from other groups\nTo see that we share something ... that we share certain needs in common so that there's such a thing as the common good\nYou know if if you were raised intellectually as much of the younger generation is\nTo think of your political engagements in terms of uh your individual identity than anyone who disagrees with your political opinions will look like it to you like they're attacking your own sense of identity\nAnd so it's striking to me that young people today for instance will say things like or what you say offends me or disturbs me rather than saying I disagree\nLet me come back to the idea of the once and future liberal how would you define\nLiberalism however you'd like to at how has it changed in the decades that you've been one and that you observed others [noise] well I was brought up at the tail end of what I call ... or the Roosevelt is ... and the idea being that from the Nineteen thirties through the Nineteen sixties\nThere was a kind of a presumption in the Democratic party that we were all citizens and on the basis of that shared citizenship we have certain rights and obligations especially obligations\nTowards each other now um we did not always live up to our ideal certainly when it comes to African Americans because of [noise]\nIn thirties through the Nineteen sixties\nThere was a kind of presumption in the Democratic party that we were all citizens and on the basis of that shared citizenship we have certain rights and obligations especially obligations\nTowards each other now um we did not always live up to our ideal certainly when it comes to African Americans because of\nThe need to pass certain kinds of legislation or a in the southern states they were essentially not full participants in the welfare state programs that came out of the thirties and I was a serious problem\nThat period ended in the Nineteen seventies for all kinds of reasons we could go into and a new era open top which was the Reagan Era which is based on very different priests positions that are different view of\nThe country end up the good life it was more individualistic uh the idea was that um you would be taken care of and your family's in local communities in church is the state was to be just trusted and so on and now we're at the end of that dispensation with Trump and the question\nIs what can liberalism look like today given the kind of people we are because you know the country came together because of the depression and World War two and there was a shared sense of common destiny\nToday we're much more individualistic people we look more to ourselves a silo ourselves online families are having trouble having dinner together at the same time with it and also without looking at their machines\nIt's important to somehow rethink what solidarity the fundamental liberal virtue would look like in a society where people are much more individualistic and every aspect of their tail\nWe look more to ourselves or we ... ourselves online families are having trouble having dinner together at the same time with it and also without looking at their machines\nIt's important to somehow rethink what solidarity the fundamental liberal virtue would look like in a society where people are much more individualistic and every aspect of their daily lives\nSought combined general liberal liberalism with the fact that we have an election coming up in less than a month the mid term elections how important do you think that is to gauge where we're at or whether there's been any progress abstain from political standpoint there's discussion of a blue wave and whether Democrats are going to do better be in response to President Trump's actions\nHow significant is is that too short term focus it is too short\nTerm I mean we got an disposition over Thirty years history and it's not something that's going to write itself because it's a question of kind of changing as a political culture of the liberal left\nAnd that would take a long time there is the one development that has been heartening to me since Donald Trump has been an office a lot of people never been involved in politics before I Want to run for office\nAnd what's striking is that they come from very diverse backgrounds but the ones who are winning in as the primaries in the elections that have taken place already are not talking about their identities they\nAren't avoiding the issue either but they're focusing on local issues plus the fate of the country

reminiscent of reverse psychology why did you do it that way\n[noise] I mean first of again one thing that's pretty clear is that the the other methods is\nTrying to get young people to vote is not a new idea um MTV has for a generation or two attempted and there have been endless sort of celebrity filled\nPlease to get young people to vote and they just don't work it just historically it's kind of shocking way young people don't turn out to vote so our first right out of the game we knew we couldn't do that\nI'm sort of the really thought was you know one thing that just true about young people across all cultures as an instinct to rebel I'm In this idea that if you if you frame the story in a way that makes it clear that they are getting played or they're suckers in this\nUm that can create an anger that can be very motivating\nFrom a general standpoint Kim millennials laugh at themselves because I think the sad sort of needs them to in some ways\nYeah I think so and you know again to just sort of conveniently lump an entire generation together is obviously silly like there are variations both among the old and among the young um but it becomes uh\nOccurs in this um that can create an anger that can be very motivating\nFrom a general standpoint Kim millennials laugh at themselves because I think the sad sort of needs them to in some ways\nYeah I think so and you know again to just sort of conveniently lump an entire generation together is obviously silly like there are variations both among the old and among the young\nUm but it becomes uh an easy it's kind of an easy handle for us to to talk about things but we are hoping that people have a sense of humor about this because it is it is ultimately tongue in cheek\nOr take away was we really wanted you\nIf you're a young person watching this and they're looking you right in the eye telling you that like I Know you're not going to vote I Know these issues matter to you but that don't matter to me that should sort of create two emotions and you want it's sort of a little funny but also it's a little infuriating um and we hope that sort of a magic\nPotion you know to get some movement to the polls\nIs there a feeling that that the president President Trump and his administration should be a driving force for this as well\nI think it is I mean we even do say I mean Trump is very unpopular among millennials 'em and these sort of the the further up the age brackets you go to the more his popularity grows and it's it's just true in general that\nPeople tend to be older people tend to be more conservative than younger people on the average prime time Fox News you're sixty six years old which was in a while we were researching that was a number that kind of stunned me that's the average\nSo there is definitely we're trying to point out to younger people that there is a ocean of distance between them\nAnd the people who are calling the shots and if they're curious about why the world is the way it is and these you see with the Parkland shooting like the young people are desperate for gun control\nWe were researching that was a number of the kind of stunned me that's the average\nSo there is definitely we're trying to point out to younger people that there is a\nOcean of distance between them and the people who are calling the shots and if they're curious about why the world is the way it is and these\nYou see it with the Parkland shooting like the young people are desperate for gun control and it just doesn't happen I'm In this is why is because they're not a potent political force\n'em to to go out there and make it happen I mean I think that's true across a bunch of issues in and Trump is part of it\nYou're casting in addition to the writing the casting was fantastic 'cause you have a combination of you've got sort of the the gruff older guy you've got the the sort of more classy older guy you've also got the the different grandmother types of like well if the weather's nice you can go out ... was it to have that combination of a different kinds of senior voice\nIt was it was very important because we it was important that they be ... be older to sort of make that point about the generation but we also didn't want to make it clear that there's all sorts of different again the just like millennials on a monolithic group neither are senior citizens\nThere are a whole bunch of different kinds of older people but the truth is like anybody else they tend to vote in their self interest\nYou know so if you're rich\nYou know tax cuts for the rich sounds like a good idea you know school shootings might not really mean that much T. F. you haven't been in school and in decades um so again the idea wasn't necessarily to say this the seniors are evil is like no they're they're self interested just like the rest of us but the differences\nTheir self interested and they vote 'em and they're not voting for the same things you're interested in millennials\nWhen you're talking about again trying to appeal the younger people do have to not only get it on their level and and what they're thinking about but also in a way that that does bring out\nIn decades um so again the idea wasn't necessarily to say this the seniors are evil is like no they're they're self interested just like the rest of us but the differences their self interested and they vote 'em and they're not voting for the same things you're interested in millennials\nWhen you're talking about again trying to appeal the younger people do you have to not only get it on their level and and what they're thinking about but also in a way that that does bring out the aspect of hey Schumer maybe even anger frustration that combination of things to have to be that kind of that\nOh the truth is we live in an era of just unprecedented\nMedia stimulation and the truth of the matter is it doesn't matter what you say if people don't notice it so the first order of business is to get noticed\nAnd so to get noticed you have to have to be a sharp edge to it has to be something that stops you and your Instagram feed or get get you to pause that five seconds to get involved\nUm so it is it's not it's not an accident that we sort of are intentionally provocative on his front and I think particularly younger people are very media savvy all they do not like to be quote unquote marketed to [noise]\nUm so you've got to really treat them with kid gloves and you'll find to find something\nSome sort of sharp edge that we'll we'll poke them and stop them and get them paying attention\nAnd very briefly was there any concern about portraying seniors as being kind of insensitive and saying well you know the school shootings I haven't been in the school and fifty years is there is there any risk in that are again is that provocative nature the intelligent nature of it the most important thing\nWell first of all no point to ever say or imply this is all senior citizens feel this way but the truth of the matter is a lot of the things are character say you'd use move the dial a few notches from you and now you're going to bump into Michael Savage a Rush Limbaugh and you will hear\nIs there any risk in that are again is that provocative nature the intelligent nature of the most important thing\nWell first of all no point to ever say or imply this is all senior citizens feel this way but the truth of the matter is a lot of the things are character say\nYou use move the dial a few notches from you and now you're going to bump into Michael Savage Rush Limbaugh and you will hear collars likely older saying things very similar to what our cast a say\nSo that's not to say every senior citizen feels that way but there are certainly are a lot who do\nAnd it's reflected in our politics so no intent to insult anybody but if you're insulted by the opinions are characters have you you should be hell we we didn't make these up you know this isn't something we pulled out of this guy this is in in our culture right now\nI look back at is the creative director at nail communications\n\n\nAnd good Monday morning to you are listening to the show here on ...
