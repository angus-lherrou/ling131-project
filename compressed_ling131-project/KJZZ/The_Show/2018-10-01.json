time\nWhen a disaster natural or otherwise hits a community there's usually a group of people who follow to help the assistance can range from search and rescue to rebuilding organizing food to any number of other activities this concept is cold mass of salt and has been around for almost fifty years\nSamantha Montana joins me via Skype to talk more about this she's a visiting assistant professor in the department of emergency management in North Dakota State University and Samantha from an emergency management perspective how do you look at sort of the cost benefit of this because it sounds like in some cases people are doing good work but maybe and others they may just kind of beginning in the way\nSo we have known about why researchers have called the math to solve that occurred during disasters for many many decades I'm In a while record it and the research that when it is after happen people and materials like donations and other resorts which can\nIn some cases people are doing good work but maybe and others they may just kind of beginning of the way\nSo we have known about what researchers have called the mass of salt that occurred during disasters for many many decades I'm In a while recorded and the research that when a disaster happened\nPeople and materials like donations and other resources converge on the impacted community we also know from the research that this convergence that occurs is overwhelmingly\nOut of like the goodness of people's hearts um it's pro social behavior people are are wanting to help the people who have been affected by the disaster and so they're coming people are coming into the area with the good intentions they do\nA lot of good they fail in kind of the gaps that exist within that community and fill in what official first responders and kind of what I call the formal emergency management are unable to address\nOn the other hand from a management perspective sometimes there can be difficulties in managing this influx of people and the influx of donations\nGuns the usefulness and the ... of these people depend on sort of their areas of expertise or how good they are and what it is that they are trying to do\nSo some of the people who converge on that community have previous disaster experience\nHave um some kind of skill that is particularly useful for addressing the needs in that community had made even been through a disaster themselves so\nThose volunteers that are converging tend to be able to kind of zero in on what the needs of the community are\nSearch on the community have previous disaster experience\nHave um some kind of skill that is particularly useful for addressing the needs in that community had maybe even been through a disaster themselves so those volunteers that are converging tend to\nBe able to kind of zero in on what the needs of the community are and are more familiar with the more\nFormal emergency management system and so they are more likely to be able to kind of integrate into that formal system so in that sense certainly some people tend to be more of\nA help than others although I Will say it really depends on what the needs of the community are in that moment so some of the things that we need people to help with like doing search and rescue you know it would be ideal\nIf people had some kind of training our experience doing that before they go out to do that type of dangerous work on the other hand there are some unmet needs in the community like needing an extra set of hands to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches where you know you don't need to have\nA lot of highly specialized skills to be able to do that\nWill how will do those tend to match how well the people who are looking to help you match\nTheir skills are what they're able to offer with what you actually need it\nIt really is going to vary from disaster to disaster ... some people who show up on scene we call them spontaneous volunteers ... they\nAre people who are not associated with any kind of organization or agency in any way and they you know heard about the disaster on the news or they live close by and so they've experienced it to a certain extent and they kind of just show up on scene and\nFor them it's kind of a hit or miss whether they are able to\nSeen we call them spontaneous volunteers ... they\nAre people who are not associated with any kind of organization or agency in any way and they you know heard about the disaster on the news or they live close by and so they've experienced that to a certain extent and they kind of just show up on scene and\nFor them it's kind of a hit or miss whether they are able to match their skills with\nThe needs of the people in the community\nWith all these people converging on the site of a disaster it must be said that not all of them are going there with pure intentions I mean how prevalent is it that\nPeople are going there to different people or to try to loot and steal or other things that are maybe less desirable behavior\nIt is actually extremely rare for people to go into a community that's experienced it does after with bad intentions part of the research that had talks about this not\nSalt has also considered human behavior during disasters and it is quite clear from the research that a crime rate don't usually go up during a disaster most of the time they actually go down\nObviously there's always a case here and there of you know fraudulent claims or some kind of other um criminal behavior but it is really quite rare\nHave emergency managers made any effort to try to\nSort of harness the power of this group of people and organize them a little bit better to say okay look we really need people who have boats to go out and try to rescue people who are we really need people to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches ... we really need acts if you can do that come to this spot we'll get your deployed will help you figure out\nHave emergency managers made any effort to try to\nSort of harness the power of this group of people and organize them a little bit better to say okay look we really need\nPeople who have boats to go out and try to rescue people or are we really need people to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or ... we really need acts if you can do that come to this spot we'll get your deployed will help you figure out where exactly to go as opposed to people just sort of randomly showing up and try it out\nYeah so this again is going to vary from disaster disaster but there are definitely happen after it's across the country\nBy local emergency management agencies but also local nonprofits that are involved in disaster work\nTo plan for the influx of volunteers and try to coordinate\nFan and so sometimes you'll see something called us all and share reception centers that is open ended in that community and sometimes that virtual so there are some cities have like a website where they try to have people sign up\nTo volunteer through and that kind of get them and I find that to go out and the community and other times he's volunteer reception centers are actual in person places where if you want to volunteer you go and show up and they connect you with an organization that you can work through\nAll right that's Samantha Montana visiting assistant professor in the department of emergency

the takeaways tending a vegan let's take a look now at the latest in the process to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nWill ... some of that comes into these peripheral details and what would you heard in a doctor for its testimony trying to corroborate issues like you know the the circumstance which she ran into mark judge at the Safeway you know a few weeks back or something they can verify became poll they can request employment records\nFrom a corporation like that on a spit presumably with Mr judges\nA consent I mean there's there's a lot of peripheral details they could probe they could try to pull documentation on they could try to re interviewed some of the relevant parties um that would have known a judge Kavanaugh would've known Dr Ford about the circumstances of this particular time for him in Nineteen eighty two just to get additional details\nUm but it really depends here again on how\nIn depth they want to truly run this probe or this is just going to be something that's done on the surface that's really just trying to placate or the individual the lawmakers you've raised concerns about due process issue\nAnd whether or not they are truly going to try to get down to the nitty gritty details or if this is just an idea of trying to get everything done on within the auspices of the FBI asking instead of just Congress\nJerry I'm I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that because I think that's a point that comes up with this as as a as a weak enough time we've we've said that gas for the FBI that that could be it should be enough time but um what

records so that that we can look at them there'll be no subpoenas should\nAnd should the FBI come back and say that they can't confirm or deny what happened ah we've got about thirty seconds Jerry what what what what happens then\nLook and I don't think they're looking to confirm or deny they got the eyes is going to gather the information complete a report and provide that report\nBrad any

it's supposed to be true that we can all achieve more than our parents did that if your parents finished high school you can grow up to get a college degree for example it's part of the story of the American dream\nAcademia it's called upward mobility and it's at the heart of a new study that looks at the generational impact of funding or under funding our schools\nWell tailored teaches economics at Carnegie Mellon university and his new research began with the census data from Nineteen forty that year was the first time the Census Bureau tracked educational attainment levels so he and a team of fellow researchers took that data interacted overtime to see how this story of upward mobility has played out in reason\nAnd it's at the heart of a new study that looks at the generational impact of funding or under funding or schools\nWell tailored teaches economics at Carnegie Mellon university and his new research began with the census data from Nineteen forty that year was the first time the Census Bureau tracked educational attainment levels so he and a team of fellow researchers took that data interacted overtime to see how this story of upward mobility has played out in recent American history\nThey found that that parents who are well educated tend to have children who also grow up to be well educated and that the reverse is true especially for those in certain parts of the country where schools for systemically under funded\nI spoke with Tyler Moore about his work and what it means for the current education of funding debate that's playing out here and across the country\nSo the key idea that we were looking at is to focus on families that were sort of toward the lower socioeconomic part of the family distribution [noise]\nUm so the children that were studying where people that were about my father's age and just all your listeners know I'm In my fifties [laughter] okay so my father was a child and then my grandmother was in in the date as well so my grandmother was pretty well educated she had an eighth grade education\nAnd then the question is going to be is my father likely to move up the educational ladder if so that's a upward mobility and so in his case he moves away ups the education ladder but you could sort of see in the data already in Nineteen forty that that was a trajectory he was on\nOur real a real question is and looking at these families whose parents have relatively low level of education let's say five to eight years of education which would've been pretty typical at the time\nAnd and who among those families are moving up the ladder and there's going to be pretty big differences or we're discovering pretty big differences by race and we're discovering a really big differences across regions in the United states across states and even across a counties were\nYou able to find what went into this and you looked at\nHis parents have relatively low levels of education let's say five to eight years of education which would have been pretty typical at the time\nAnd and who among those families are moving up the ladder and there's going to be pretty big differences we're discovering pretty big differences by race and we're discovering a really big differences across regions in the United states across states and even across a counties were\nYou able to find what went into this and you looked at teachers' salaries people teacher ratio things like that and how did the funding picture come into this\nYeah that's right so it turns out that also in in the Nineteen thirties every state had I'm extremely detailed a historical records in which the ... kept track of of funding\nAnd of the employment of teachers and from these data it's very easy to to reconstruct at the state level and even at the county level I'm average teacher salaries\nAverage people teacher ratios and um other indicators of schooling quality\nUsing those data what we're we're going to do is is the following kind of exercise start with white kids\nSo we'll look at the white kids across the forty eight states plus the district of Columbia and will order the states from those that have lots of upward mobility to to to those who have relatively low level of suffered mobility All right and then we'll compare those to states like California and Minnesota and New York that had a high rate of mobility\nAnd it turns out there's an ... ... strong association between upward mobility rates between these kids kind of moving up the educational ladder and teacher salaries um and also people teacher ratios so places that pay teachers relatively well tended to have teachers who themselves were pretty well educated\nAnd then that spills over toward higher up all mobility that is kids especially kids from the lower socioeconomic status tend to move up the ladder\nThis was sort of in despite of what their parents educate\nEducational ladder and teacher salaries um and also people teacher ratios so places that pay teachers relatively well tended to have teachers who themselves were pretty well educated\nAnd then that spills over toward higher up of mobility that is kids especially kids from the lower socioeconomic status tend to move up the ladder\nAnd this was sort of in despite what their parents education attainment level might have been yeah that's\nRight so so what happens is for for children who had relatively well educated parents right now I'm back in Nineteen forty and my grandmother's generation that would have been people with let's say high school degrees or or especially parents with college degrees\nThose parents tended to have kids that did well regardless of of what state they were in or regardless of what county they were in its these kids from the sort of lower um educational status families that are benefiting the most from well funded schools\nAnd looking at this big picture generational on shift what were you able to conclude\nSo the first sort of thing that you learn is that the people in my father's generation\nThose people who are going to be more successful would have been people who are born in places or or or grew up in places like Massachusetts like my father did\nOr in California or in Oregon where we're Minnesota places with well funded schools um that's generally true and then for the kind of repercussions for an African American families ah the picture's really a a a disquieting\nSo what was happening in Nineteen forty that we had a segregated schools throughout the south as well as a lower levels of segregation elsewhere owned by the way this was true for example for a Mexican American students to do it to a lesser extent\nBut but moving up to the African American students who are disproportionately in the south they went directly to segregated schools and those schools were the worst\nSo what was happening in Nineteen forty that we had a segregated schools throughout the south yeah as well as the lower levels of segregation elsewhere owned by the way this was true for example for a Mexican American students to do it to a lesser extent\nBut but moving up to the African American students who are disproportionately in the south they went directly to segregated schools and those schools were the worst funded schools in the country so in a place like Mississippi\nThe pupil teacher ratio or could easily be in some counties sixty one\nAnd many teachers were paid um two hundred dollars a year or less which even even correcting for inflation is only about four thousand dollars a year and as a consequence these are these children experienced exceptionally low rates of upward mobility\nYes and when you look at it from the sort of macro perspective you can see this sort of the flies in the face of of this idea of the American dream right that you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps and do more than your parents did right\nYeah I think that's the right way to think about it so the the American Dream is really about upward mobility it's the idea that even children board and modest circumstances can end up doing well in life\nAnd and well that's true while there are many examples of children born in a difficult circumstances who do well um there are many more who don't and on average one of the factors that shapes that upward mobility is educational resources and so why\nActually to drive the cars [laughter] so I see a big potential and you're doing lamenting does disturb the Brian are developed\nThat's at us at ... ending that story

temperatures can be prevented from rising by more than one and a half degrees Celsius this century\nYou will remember a mock and you're listening as well three years ago we had the Paris climate accord\nThat countries agree to long term goal of keeping global temperature increases to quote well below two degrees Celsius but that a cold also called for a special report into limiting the temperature increase even further and that's really what this week in South Korea is all about\nThe scientists that will warn that at one point five degree increase will be reached in just Twenty years from now unless we take rapid action our environment correspondent Matt ... says these scientists and South Korea have their work cut out for them\nTo scientists have to convince representatives of most of the world's governments that their conclusions sound there are concerns that some of the major fossil fuel producing countries will do their best this week to water down the report's conclusions\nSome of these scientists and South Korea say we need to reduce CEO to emissions fast and we need to switch to renewable justice quickly but as we can see what the us withdrawing a call from the Paris accord none of that looks very likely\nAll right Rob let's move from South Korea to Brazil where there's a big election coming up this weekend both for president and for parliament who's running\nWhether it's quite complicated so let's stick to the presidential elections which are on Sunday\nThe man widely favorite to win those isn't even on the ballot he's former president Lula

all of that he would dramatically stopped on September the ... on the campaign trail\nRunning second to him is Fernando ... dad who took former president leave this place\nAround what is the mood in

there the hold a referendum on changing their constitution what exactly is on the ballot\nWell it's another potentially complicated story Nicholson issue there'd be no numerous ballots in the U.S about the legal definition of marriage but it's an interesting story when it relates to Romania Romania was socially conservative and the orthodox Christian church has a lot of influence the\nBut there was recently a case brought on behalf of an American man who was married to a Romanian man they got married in Belgium with same sex marriage is legal\nBut when they try to move to remain at the American gentlemen applied for permission to reside in the country about there was no legal basis for that as Romania doesn't recognize same sex marriage\nThe case went all the way to the European Court of justice which ruled that old ... countries including Romania must offer residency to the spouses of citizens whether they ... off on the sexual couples\nWell it sounds like that was all resolved then\nWell it sounds like it on the face of it but it also came up with the remaining constitution only refer to spouses in a marriage it does not mention into\nThat has galvanized conservatives to try and change the constitution that to define marriage as between a man and a woman and of course gay rights' campaigners are not happy at all about this vote and they will and that it doesn't add anything to Romanian writes it just takes way possible recognition from gay and lesbian couples\nThere just to sum up this weekend Romanians will vote on a constitutional amendment to

millions of women in the U.S but there is another side to the story according to our next guest Andrew euro spent the last two years talking to hundreds of men who he says are being left out of modern American society in his new book man out men on the sidelines of American Life he\nDelves into the troubling reality for these millions of men who are out of work angry and caught in the current fog of gender roles in America\nI spoke with him more about the book and who exactly these men are\nAre located really for populations of man white working class men are sort of Trump to your constituents and see\n'em but also over fifty a middle and upper middle class man formerly incarcerated man which they're Seventeen million in the U.S and a millennial man we're doing particularly poorly\nThere seems to be a narrative in America today about men that like working class white men are the ones that are being left out or or have been sidelined by technology by globalization they've lost their jobs in the recession and they were sort of\nLike you mentioned the the people who were angry and voted in President Trump that you hear a lot about that constituency now is that what you're talking about is that narrative true\nIt's true but that's part of my story of of men out I think they're\n... they're at least one of the million man who or and or not working nod and families not with their children having addiction problems or other health problems\nNuns who were angry politically angry and angry toward women and others so this is such a thing\nStory of of men out I think they're\nAs I estimate there at least twenty million man who or and or not working not and families not with their children having addiction problems or other health problems\nAnd who were angry politically angry and angry toward women and others\nThat this is such a diverse group like there seems to cross economic and cultural and racial boundaries I Wonder how it is that you realize this was happening how did you find\nYou know that's a great question I saw a number of problems out there that they've tended to be sort of silo there's scene separately has problems one the growing numbers of men who dropped out of the labor force are not working at all [noise]\nOne a huge number of fathers who are not with their children\n... tensions between men and women I was almost go so far as to say\nA kind of gender or out there a particularly the massaging the on the part of the many man\nI'm particularly fueled by the Internet\nAnd um you know a lot of other things like millennium man they're more likely to be at home a comeback to parents or relatives the millennial women I mean just a lot of different phenomena that are hitting man a certain swaths of man pretty hard\nI Want to talk a little bit about what led up to death I mean I Would assume that this is economic but that may not be the whole story and did this begin you think with the recession\nIts economic and cultural on the economic side yes or a law the man who who lost\nOther different phenomena the are hitting man a certain swath of man pretty hard\nI Want to talk a little bit about what led up to death I mean I Would assume that this is economic but that may not be the whole story and did this begin you think with the recession\nWell its economic and cultural on the economic side yes or a law the man who who lost jobs to either couldn't find jobs are found jobs that you know many told me they felt were below them you know like working as a quirk of the big box store\nBut on the other hand there's this cultural demands for which gets to masculinity are toxic masculinity\nWhat do you mean by toxic masculinity\nWell traditional masculinity which some calls toxic or is this set up a leaf set of norms that you know men have to be tough men have to have as many sexual partners as possible men don't express emotions don't cry and uh\nYou know I think there's a lot of confusion out there in terms of masculinity these days there's an interesting survey of young man\nThat found majority of young men so subscribing to gender equity but then when asked how do they ah they say well I feel the peer pressure I have to act like you know this old style man\nAnd one of the results of something like that you know if you look at that on a almost kind of on an individual level what kinds of things did you hear from men of all ages and and and races and economic levels about what that make them do in their lives\nI mean there were a young man I talked to who just you know hold up with their parents or felt depressed felt ashamed of their lives a young man who had been\nYou look at that on a almost not up on an individual level what kinds of things did you hear from men of all ages and and and races in economic levels about why that make them do in their lives\nI mean there were a young man I talked to who just you know hold up with their parents or felt depressed felt ashamed of their lives a young man who had been opioid addicts young men addictive gamers\nBut probably the most troubling thing is the massage from the the massaging the that is especially seeing online we've all heard of uh the many online anonymous\nAttacks on women journalists we see the attacks with a doctor for it and the Kavanaugh hearings\nYou know does threatened her life for threat interest sexually\nAnd I'm a lot of attacks toward both axes women now man though and and women in general I mean some of it's quite file\nAfter having gotten all of this research topped all of these men and do you think that that anger even if it isn't is directed is legitimate and family\nWell somewhat I mean I think they're a lot of things that are are going wrong for man or for some man but you know the whole issue of not working\nIn many cases how did they support themselves they turn to wives or girlfriends these wives often become ex wives but as I said there there are a lot of other ways in which men are hurting their\nYou know twice as likely to die of overdoses they're three and a half times as likely to commit suicide I mean not to damage with statistics\nHow did they support themselves they turn to wives or girlfriends these wives often become ex wives but as I said there there are a lot of other ways in which men are hurting their\nYou know twice as likely to die of overdoses they're three and a half times as likely to commit suicide I mean not to damage with statistics but you know the clearly a lot of expressions of hurt out there\nYeah so I guess then the question is is what do we do about this I guess this is this a reaction to women gaining power over the last generation and therefore men being displaced by that is there no way to sort of do that well and we can be equally successful well\nThere certainly are strong currents are new currents of uh what some call positive masculinity\nKinds of groups that actually have curricula to teach man to teach fathers\nYou know how to be more sensitive to me more caring with their children with women in their lives uh with men if they're gay but on the other hand I think it will take more than that I mean for example with online massaging the\nI mean I strongly believe that there needs to be stronger laws and stronger enforcement of of all kinds of hate speech from the Internet and\nYou know in the culture too I think boys need to learn being a boy is not is not being toxic um there was a great quote from a former NFL lineman Joe airman who said\nThe three most destructive words to the uh
