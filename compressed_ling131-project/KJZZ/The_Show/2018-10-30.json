President Trump said if the tree of life synagogue it had protection the results would have been far better this is not the first shooting at a religious event in recent years and security experts say it can be difficult to prevent incidents like these that churches synagogues and other houses of worship it's on ... and thanks a lot about\nHe runs the it'll the law group in Scottsdale and is vice president of the events safety alive which is an international trade association or ... smart Brody spoke with them and ask them if there's anything he thinks the synagogue could have done to have prevented the shooting\nIn a word no there just isn't\nThere is a laundry list of usual suggestions\nStarting with off duty police officers will we know how that went because police arrive very quickly at the synagogue and unfortunately several the police officers who arrived on site very quickly wound up being the first one sent to the hospital with gunshot wounds\nSo that wouldn't have been the solution the next often discuss solution is private security guards\nIt seems clear to me that if law enforcement with training in using firearms and in responding to people shooting firearms if that didn't work than private security guards paid a modest hourly wage were unlikely to run towards an active shooter that's heroism that\nYou know is so far above their pay grade fairly literal sense\nThat no reasonable person would expect that\nThan there are things like locked doors which are fairly standard at houses of worship not so much on the Sabbath which this was it was Saturday morning at a Jewish synagogue that's the Sabbath\nBut even if the doors had been locked it wouldn't have made any difference because the shooter was obviously intent on breaking in and doing very great harm so things like locked doors are closed circuit TV cameras aren't going to matter in a circumstance like what we saw on Saturday in Pittsburgh\nNot so much on the Sabbath which this was it was Saturday morning at a Jewish synagogue that's the Sabbath\nBut even if the doors had been locked it wouldn't have made any difference because the shooter was obviously intent on breaking in and doing very great harm so things like locked doors are closed circuit TV cameras aren't going to matter in a circumstance like what we saw on Saturday in Pittsburgh also\nGiven all of that and given what you do for a living what do you make of the fact that it seems as though there was literally nothing that could've been done to make the situation much\nBetter to be honest I'm deeply frustrated I'm very sad I'm Jewish um\nThis hits home for me I have a friend who lives in the area and this is something that affects everyone it's not just a Jewish issue all of this particular shooting was\nBut houses of worship had been attacked by gunman distressing laid off and even in recent memory so this isn't just an issue of anti Semitism all of this particular shooting was\nBut it's an issue for anyone who would congregate of the house of worship to engage in prayer with other like minded people and really for all intents and purposes it's an issue that affects every place where the public congregate it's well\nIt's interesting you say that because especially on a Sabbath day a Saturday morning at most synagogues a Sunday Morning at a church\nThe whole point is that people are kind of coming and going you these houses of worship want to encourage people as many people to come in and pray and be part of the community as possible\nAnd yet it seems like at the same time when you have open doors even if you have a guard it's almost like and I hate to use this phrase but it's almost like every congregation everywhere is basically just a bunch of sitting ducks\nAgain in a word yes that's right houses of worship are as ...\nCourage people as many people to come in and pray and be part of the community as possible and yet it seems like at the same time when you have open doors even if you have a guard it's almost like and I hate to use this phrase but it's almost like every congregation everywhere is basically just a bunch of sitting ducks\nAgain in a word yes that's right\nHouses of worship are as exposed to the threat of outsiders as supermarkets and shopping malls and other places that are really by design\nOpen to everyone I mean the whole purpose of religion is to provide comfort for everyone and so they can't have\nLocked doors on the Sabbath that would be antithetical to their entire purpose\nAnd the thing that I find most distressing about this particular shooting is I have nothing new to say all the same things that I've said and countless previous incidents where there's been an active shooter wielding an A R Fifteen [noise]\nAll the same things apply in equal force here I have nothing new to add so given that I mean\nWhat do you say that I mean you can't just throw up your hands and and give up I mean what what should people be trying to do or what maybe what different wages people will be trying to think about this kind of safety and security\nWell I don't think they should be thinking about it in different ways\nBecause the ways that we do think about safety and security makes sense should there be off duty police officers yes there should\nAnd that is a common tactic already unfortunately off duty police officers are fairly expensive as they should be and they don't grow on trees so that is a common solution for a limited amount of time and I think it's an excellent one\nWaves that we do think about safety and security makes sense should there be off duty police officers yes there should\nAnd that is a common tactic already unfortunately off duty police officers are fairly expensive as they should be and they don't grow on trees so\nThat is a common solution for a limited amount of time and I think it's an excellent one similarly with private security guards that's very valuable they provide if nothing else a visual deterrent and some private security guards are very effective incompetent to their jobs and I think they do excellent work\nLocked doors closed circuit TV cameras vehicles posted that show law enforcement colors at the entrance to otherwise public accommodations all of these are good ideas they make sense they're widely practice now\nNone of them stopped the shooter\nNone of them would stop the shooter under similar circumstances next weekend so that's the frustrating part for me because the low hanging fruit has already been picked\nFor people who worship in a place that doesn't have those basic\nSecurity measures the thing that they can do is to point out we don't have these very basic security measures we should and\nSomeone in the thirties should be listening and say you know we perhaps didn't pay close enough attention the last time this happened but this is our wake up call if there's nothing else good that happens from this tragedy that would be something good\nAll

church is a nonprofit that helps and quote\nTo learn more I'm told by ... corps volunteer member of the Phoenix restoration project so why did you and the organization make this request of the

alleged shooter now in custody believe that Jewish people were helping transport members of the so called caravan of roughly refugees fleeing violence and hungry Honduras\nI'm not safe to assume after checking his social media posts that his disbelief was the final motivator for his attack\nSo we just felt that this is a time of heightened tension and concern there are a lot of fears in the United states about the micro caravan it's being used to fly him anti immigrant sentiment um and we felt that this was just a time to get off the message about up most care being needed for the unemployment

churches involved\nWe've partnered with um say about four or five organizations and the rest I Believe have been contacted by ice separately a couple of weeks ago we assisted with private providing support for about a hundred and twenty families who came through the Phoenix\nArea what sort of expectations would you have for media in terms of how they would cover or something like this is this just sort of given extra thought before you report on something or is it deeper than that\n[noise] well I think uh and and this goes beyond the immediate circumstances we're facing right now in the United states but uh for the course of the last few years we've seen many of those we assist assist or fleeing violence in Central America I've had more than one person told me I absolutely cannot have my photo up here\nIn the news or any other source because there are people back home who want me dead\nSo what we try to do is as an organ as a volunteer organization our primary concern is that people safely get on their way and that their immediate needs are being taken care of\nWhat has mentioned to the news media it's not it's not a secret that people pass through the greyhound station most people are traveling on buses and my advice would be to not approaching individual um but just always consider the the power dynamics at play perhaps\nSo what we try to do is as an organ as a volunteer organization our primary concern is that people safely get on their way and that their immediate needs are being taken care of\nWhat I was mentioned to the news media it's not it's not a secret that people pass through the greyhound station most people are traveling on buses and my advice would be to not approaching individual um but just always consider the power dynamics at play perhaps reach out to a larger group of people traveling state your purpose and that you're there\nAnd then see who comes forward sometimes people do come forward and they do want to share their stories\nBut what we find as all in tears when um we have people in an environment that we've arranged to support them\nProvide them with food with phone assistants water other practical assistance asking people for interviews compromises the clarity of our vision and our mission to help because we find that people feel as though they do not have the option to say no they feel indebted to us\nSo it's always considering that power dynamic at play and that this may not be the best moment in people's lives where they would like to sit down and tell a story we also like to talk about how trauma um we should not be asking about ... asking people to unpack stories\nThat they're not prepared to put back away and we feel sometimes in the pressure of the moment they may feel as though um they're obligated to tell a story um that might not be in their best interest is how\nHave you been concerned that that some media have handled it that way from the standpoint that there is there's had balancing act of trying to give people more information and make people may not have known of some of the plight of many of these revenues obviously without the media but there's a concern on your part of their maybe there is that you've mentioned the power to him is that at the core\nOf the there's a a great deal of difference between you know assisting people and explaining to them that they may encounter media later on in their journeys and advising them about their options um versus directly collaborating with the media and allowing a A R news resource to film people the moment they

versus directly collaborating with the media and allowing a A R news resource to film people the moment they step off in ice bus right so I think it always um it's it's very concerning when entire groups of people are getting filmed without their explicit consent\nUm and I have seen some reporters who are much more aware of the power dynamics they might sit back and observe a situation I'm In more of a public location and they might approach an entire group and ask if anyone would like to share their story and then kind of sit back and set of persisting and waiting for them to come forward\nThere have been of course in the past with the national level the concerns that maybe the New York times should report something because it could put people in national security danger and for some people that that was also sort of a potential chilling effect on that do you worry about the message it sends that OK media up to a point where like this but not beyond that\nYou know I really struggle on this I think it is important for some stories to get out in a tactful manner but I Believe that right now those who are concerned about the plight of those in the migrant caravan for example those who are concerned are already out on the ground are already reaching out in their personal networks in their communities in their churches asking how can I help\nNot every company

board at our or is it a go series continues\nBut first heading into the holiday season many people look for ways to give back to those in need off and this involves giving food and other items to people who are homeless but at Phoenix Group called the healthy giving council says giving directly can have unintended consequences\nThey launch an effort this week to nudge well intentioned givers toward what they call healthy beginning and joining us to explain this idea is you around Parker he's a pastor what the first Christian Church and part of the healthy getting council good morning the morning thanks for coming in so let's start with this idea of healthy getting what do you mean by that\nSo healthy giving is is kind of a self explanatory as it's playing on the desire of people wanting to give\nOn and we're just saying let's do that in a healthy way and so it begs the question what does that mean right uh and so then that's when we get into the conversation of saying we know that you're well intentioned we know that you want to do something good we know that giving makes you feel good\nUm but doing it in a healthy weight can make you feel better\nAnd so that means not giving on the ...\nOr of people wanting to give a and then we're just saying let's do that in a healthy way and so it begs the question what does that mean right uh and so then that's when we get into the conversation of saying we know that you're well intentioned we know that you want to do something good we know that giving makes you feel good\nUm but doing it in a healthy weight can make you feel better\nAnd so that means not giving on the street or not feeding on the street but directing people um that are experiencing homelessness\nTo hundreds of non profit organizations that provide meals everyday that provide clothing that provide shelter that literally are set up to close the gap between people experiencing homelessness and actually getting them into permanent housing\nRight and you think you see around the holidays and increasing you see more and more people on the kind of the road on them at the sign asking for money or for things like that\n[noise] correct well and and the thing is it increases around the holidays but homelessness is a is an issue that we deal with three hundred and sixty five days of the year\nAnd so what we've seen is around the holidays that these are street theatres in St givers they come out in droves right because it's the giving season it's Thanksgiving and Christmas is about giving\nAnd so like I said they're well intentioned but we're just saying you know what your we can take that that good intention that you have and we can maximize that impact by partnering with an organization that does these things every single day\n... ideal situation could someone do both get someone bringing a minimal amount of food and clothing and then also at the same time said do you need to get through the day but there are services to hear some of them or or is that just sort of feeding the beast a little bit too much at that\nPoint yeah I think it's um I think it's a given ... take a mile type of thing and so what we want to encourage

political ads this year in Arizona Arizona race for the U.S Senate has made national headlines for how close it is and how negative cages easiest Brett jasper's reports on why we're seeing all the nastiness\nOne of the most notorious ad shows democratic representative cures didn't send them out wearing a pink two two and protesting the Iraq War you've probably seen it cinemas opponent for the Senate Republican Martha McSally launched the ad before the primary was even over here's Mick Sally at a rally last month at a GOP office in Sun City\nYou know I'm running against somebody who spent time organizing protests and protesting are cheap and if you do you see that any\nCinema has said she was protesting the war and not the troops and there's a big difference between those things the ad was rated mostly false by politifact button mix Sally has made no apologies for the tone of the campaign\nWhen people ask me like you know ... you know wiping out the negative I think that it's a public service people\nMake Sally has said she had to go negative sense in a mall was up on TV early defining herself as a moderate and ignoring her past as a progressive state lawmaker there and Henry a registered Democrat heard mix Sally defend the decision on the radio and it turned 'em off\nYour on your race may come out to people why he wants them to vote for you and what you play ... hey I think this person is doing this and all the negative publicity over here I don't like this\nLike a lot of Democrats cinema has tried to steer the conversation repeatedly toward healthcare and seismic Sally is attacking her to avoid\nTopic it looks like Martha has continued to do what she's doing during the campaign which is a lot of negative and father tax against me to avoid talking about her own rhetoric we heard Arizona\nAll the negative publicity over here I don't like this\nLike a lot of Democrats cinema has tried to steer the conversation repeatedly toward healthcare and seismic Sally is attacking her to avoid\nThat topic it looks like my continued to do what she's doing during the campaign which is a lot of negative and falling attacks against me and they tend to avoid talking about her own record which areas but cinemas allies\nHave run negative ads to one ad co sponsored by a liberal veterans advocacy group and democratic nonprofit accused ... of betraying veterans because of her votes on health care plenty of pro cinema ads have said make Sally voted to repeal protections on preexisting conditions although the details are more complicated than that\nKim ... is a professor at ASU who studies negative campaigning Senate races and women in politics she says different negative ads have different effects\nSo if you're talking about an issue like health care and you're criticizing your opponent but you're not doing it in an overly straightened manner that could help 'em depress evaluations of your opponent so in that case it makes sense to go negative\nIt makes sense if the ad is relevant but other negative messages are irrelevant and on civil for ... says they use harsh language and scary music for research with a colleague suggest irrelevant and on civil ads may not affect what a voter thinks about a candidate but it could change that voters behavior\nWe do find that if there's lots of ads that are irrelevant and on civil that means you know it's overly negative and there are a lot of those that we find that that actually leads people to disengage and maybe not turn out to vote\nCase in point of Peoria woman I met in a target parking lot in Glendale she wouldn't give me her name because her son's in the military and she said she wouldn't like that she definitely doesn't like the ads in the Senate campaign my God those ads are\nAnd uncivil that means you know it's overly negative and there are a lot of those that we find that that actually these people to disengage and maybe not turn out to vote\nCase in point a Peoria woman I met in a target parking lot in Glendale she wouldn't give me her name because her son's in the military and she said she wouldn't like that she definitely doesn't like the ads in the Senate campaign\nMy God those ads are horrible absolutely horrible it was a lot of them yes there are and I drive you know two hours every day I might need it and I hear I Can't tell you how many ads and honestly it reminds me as petty school ground catty girl just going at each other so I just\nPrefer to distance myself from that so you might not vote in that race because of that track\nThis woman did vote in the twenties sixteen presidential race for the same reason for the kid says certain voters are more likely to be turned off from the negativity and not vote\nIt does depressed turnout among people who are less interested among women among independents and so that would definitely heard Democrats more than Republicans\nFridge can doesn't know if depressing democratic turnout is a strategy of mix Sally is what is clear is that Arizona Senate race has seen some of the highest spending in the country including ad spending and this in an era when so many voters don't need to

S. Eighteen marks the beginning of civic responsibility now you can vote in the u._k. China and parts of Canada it means you can get into bars in Israel it means a mandatory draft into the military by Eighteen one in five women across the globe will be married\nAnd this series in New York Times photo editors sought out twenty two young women photographers and countries from Mexico to Nigeria so it's part photography perjure project and part documentary each young photographer was assigned a mentor\nAnd coached as they documented the lives of these other young women and the result is moving portrayed and what it means to be Eighteen years old around the world today\nI spoke with Sandra Stevenson more about it she was the projects picture editor she said they use their network a photographer's they know around the world to find the young women who would take part in this project and then ask them to track down their subjects other young women who were Eighteen or would turn Eighteen this year\nWe also asked them to look for a diverse\nAnd the result is moving portrayed and what it needs to be Eighteen years old around the world today\nI spoke with Sandra Stevenson more about it she was the projects picture editor she said they use their network a photographer's they know around the world to find the young women who would take part in this project and then ask them to track down their subjects other young women who were Eighteen or would turn Eighteen this year\nWe also asked them to look for diversity and the people that they were meeting\nOn diversity meaning diversity of course within their own on community it could be ethnically also socio economically uh and remarkably\nAll of these women came up with um each each of them came up with three young women that were really quite diverse both in their interests you know where they were from what type of family they came from\nYeah the you selected the photographers and then also selected this subject I Want to talk about both of those groups of of young women ... to start with the photographer tell us about a few of these these young women and where they're from and how prepared they worked for this I guess\nWell you have to ask the young women themselves how prepared even though I personally felt like they were remarkable\nYou know they really did come from very and backgrounds one young woman was a refugee from Sudan and her family relocated to Kenya\nAnd as you know she participated in in the project and did a really wonderful job and you know even if I had to ask could you please go back and shoot a little bit more\nYou know they were so willing and so eager to get it right yeah I'm sure that's partially because you know they they probably felt I'm sure they felt a little bit of pressure on but that was also why we wanted to housing than tourists there so that if they did\nIn the project and did a really wonderful job and you know even if I had to ask could you please go back and shoot a little bit more\nYou know they were so willing and so\nEager to get it right yeah I'm sure that's partially because you know they they probably felt I'm sure they felt a little bit of pressure\nOn but that was also why we wanted to have the tourists there so that if they did feel that pressure they had somebody to turn to\nAnother young woman was from and Korea and she really really went the extra mile by you know following her subject who was interested in body painting the young woman from Mexico Jesse\nWas fabulous the really turned it into a documentary about just young woman's life in Mexico\nYou as you mean and Mississippi also\nYou know she actually shot hers on an iPhone or and it was fantastic and it also you know in these young women covering\nTheir peers they seem to have also learn something not only about themselves but also something about their own community which I thought was interesting uh some of the young women\nThe photographers and the subjects were also going through you know some personal difficult times or some personal struggles\nAnd I you know that I also found interesting and how they were able to how the families and other subjects and the and the subjects themselves were so willing to allow their peers to capture happy moments and it's time sad moments you\nKnow the young woman in Iran lost her grandmother a during the shoots and she allowed you know the photographer to spend time with her and her family while they were greeting which was you know totally to me\nOf the subjects and the and the subjects themselves were so willing to allow their peers to capture happy moments and at times sad moments you know the young woman in Iran lost her grandmother\nA during the shoots and she allowed you know the photographer to spend time with her and her family while they were grieving which was you know totally to me it totally moving the fact that she felt comfortable enough\nWith her photographer to to allow her to be there was was really remarkable it's the ... that says a lot about the subjects and a lot about the photographers yeah\nSo I Wonder is Sandra why go about it this way like why not send a professional photographer to document the lives of Eighteen year olds all over the world I'm sure it could have done that\nYes that would have been easier [laughter] however\nI truly believe and I think my colleagues on the team believed that we probably would have never been able to have some of these moments that really\nShowed an Eighteen year old being Eighteen I'm not sure that Leona in Iran\nWould have felt comfortable having an adult there photographing her\nWe're not sure that victory in Nigeria would have been so free to\nAn adult into their room which to me is a very personal thing\nAnd also we we wanted it was really important for us to allow young women to have a voice and the only way to allow these young women to have their voice whether it's through photography or you know through the interviews of their subjects as to how then be empowered to do it\nYou know we I think too many times the times included the New York times included you know lots of news organizations it's usually\nA story told through the eyes of\nAllow these young women to have their voice whether it's through photography or you know through the interviews of their subjects is to have them be empowered to do it\nYou know we I think too many times the times included the New York times included you know lots of news organizations it's usually\nA story told through the eyes of an adult to maybe close to age to their subject for not so close in age but I really I think we all agree that we were not convinced that we would have had the candor and openness if it had been an older person photographing them\nYeah and there's the community aspect of that as well like you mentioned right like that these were opportunities for these young women photographers to document other young women but also the to tell the stories of their own community\nYes which is extremely important which you know we don't always we don't always get you know in mainstream media and any opportunity for a particular community to have their stories told in their voice I think is really important now\nI Want to talk about and what this perspective and using this perspective might have revealed then like you you've mentioned to the diversity of the young women involved in this project on both sides of the lens right and you looked at Eighteen year olds all over the globe\nBut at the same time do you think that there were some universal here that there were some similarities that relation through\nI think the similarities\nOne thing that I did notice they really all like area on the ground day [laughter] I was little surprise but I guess I shouldn't be surprised there were quite a few pictures where you know the couch and said and she's listening to area on the ground with her girlfriends or singing or ... you know on your mobile phone and it was really\nTo me that was really hilarious I they are\nI think the similarities one thing that I didn't notice they really all like ... day [laughter] I was a little surprised but I guess I shouldn't be surprised there were quite a few pictures where you know the couch and said\nAnd she's a sitting the area on the ground with her girlfriends or singing or ... you know on your mobile phone and it was really\nTo me that was really hilarious I they all seem to struggle with the same thing of feeling like\nAdults don't hear them and adult sort of dismiss them because they're sort of in this in between age I think Helene in\nIn California if I'm not mistaken talked about this beautiful gray spots of there and and I think they all sort of feel like this beautiful gray spots but they all sort of feel that older people maybe not take them seriously or\nMaybe not not necessarily want to hear what they have to say and I think that also empowering them to have a voice is really important to them far more important I think than they even realized until we went through the process and they were able to see the final product\nSandra Stevenson is an assistant editor and the photography department with the
