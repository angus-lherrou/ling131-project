Money so so you know how to milk the cow by hand oh yeah oh yeah yeah\n... spent his summers as a kid working on his grandparents dairy farm in Wisconsin\nAndy is still in the dairy world he is now a dairy economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably ah you know close to a hundred percent are able to Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have the ... a good started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rats and Andy had a ring side seat to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started flooding this idea\nOf okay hey momma\nMomma I weigh\nOne of the ways Carter proposed giving farmers and equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nIt certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually\nOh I Am a part of them have bomb on them\nBut I haven't given mama's boy\nOne of the ways Carter proposed giving farmers an equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nYeah it certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nSo a campaign promise that is what we call those yeah there you go\nThis was not just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own sued because if our farmers go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food then that is a kind of national security risk\nAnd it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new is it it's one thing to provide stability is another step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk is going up more than six cents a gallon to just going up because the government is\nAnd you you hear of it and you like smack your forehead oh boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that it would get as bad as a guy but every instinct I had said who is ... is going to work out so well\nHello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show the story of what happened when the president of the United states decided he was going to help America farmers by buying milk lots of them it is a case study in what happens when price controls\nRuns both feet into the realities of the market there will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river\nHello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show the story of what happened when the president of the United states decided he was going to help America farmer's wife buying milk loss of though it is a case study in what happens when price controls\nRuns both feet into the realities of the market there will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river\nOr you can try to get your surplus goods to people who were not going to buy it anyway and that you won't be flooding anyone's markets\nWhen we have a surplus of grain or soy or even powdered milk we can send that stuff overseas as part of foreign aid\nShe's just doesn't travel well so the government gave a bunch to schools than to the army but this was not putting even a dent in the surplus so they created a brand new special program to give the cheese away through food bank the idea was\nWhen we have a surplus of grain or soy or even powdered milk we can send that stuff overseas as part of foreign aid\nBut she's just doesn't travel well so the government gave a bunch to schools than to the army but this was not putting even a dent in the surplus so they created a brand new special program to give the cheese the way through food bank\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much\nBut the problem Andy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and so anybody wants to choose which could you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like bricks and this is what people will remember as government cheese because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great change give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus\nThis footage is amazing style massive crowds of people being handed bricks that or she is and it's the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard some black USDA stamps on it and he's\nA state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt is this moment that government she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the caves full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food banks and schools military mess halls for a lot of people\nEver see just like brown cardboard some black USDA stamps or state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt is this moment the government's she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the caves full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food banks and schools military mess halls\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became\nFact we're ready for you\nMany listeners may remember Saturday Night live Matt fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nOf government cheese and\nGovernments she starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture a short story by Junot Diaz clear the government cheese from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of songs\nWe bought we get we get like a lot of them was something she but\nMaybe government she's the most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook stuff with\nHas never had to buy\nWhere's the nice\nTo have a government cheese\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair it was processed cheese kind of like a broken Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nWas ten times better than bill I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to men but I'm not ... but I'll tell you the the government process move was ten times\nOf a crappy government handout and to be fair it was processed cheese kind of like a broken Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than ... I hate that you know Belviq is okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to ban but I'm not running down bell veto but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat boards trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nParents doing the dance carrying doing the dance strain but here is why government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nBut I haven't given mama's boy\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough\nWell I think there's there's a two basic lessons\nAgain economist Andy ... which\nOne is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\nAutumn is Andy ... which\nOne is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented very very expensive she's indeed\nThe government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen\nBut that does not mean the government had fix the problem the thing about price controls is that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we get this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk\nOne part of the solutions and west to jet Li get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk\nLike hey people of America wouldn't you like to drink more male [laughter]\nWe took a a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... they sold and we created the national dairy board but this is ...\nTo stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk\nLike hey people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk [laughter]\nWe took a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every pundit milk this old and we've created the national dairy board but this is what it was a you know the got milk milk mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension so these days if the government wants to help farmers what you'll generally here about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the the government has tended\nTo stay away from buying cheese of solution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the aid of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies the Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again\nAnd then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like schools and food banks that would be fair that's probably\nEnough to start filling caves which again but there is a chance that the government maybe in the business of government [noise] to the cheesecake [noise] today's episode was produced by Alexi for God's the Nick fountain\nEarmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like schools and food banks that would be fair that's probably not enough to start selling caves with chief\nAgain but there is a chance that the government maybe in the business of government you to the cheesecake [noise] today's episode was produced by Alexi or with God's each little mountain hand arena
