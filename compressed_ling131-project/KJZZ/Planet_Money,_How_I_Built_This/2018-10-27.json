sudden I'm On this mountain in this life goes off for me and I think why isn't somebody made something of fruit that some spices like something very just pure simple\nReal food but it's portable inconvenient but it tastes indulgent like shouldn't be eating it like don't junk food I mean I don't know that day at that moment\nIt was like this surge of energy I got I could feel this excitement over an idea it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around every day with ideas for whatever reason a bad day in that time and all those little experiences that built up I I just felt at\nWhat'd you do did you like run home and and and in certain like writing things down or drawing pictures or or did you just kind of mulling over for all for a while\nSo I ran down the mountain I got\nA new book and I started writing down ideas and then when we got back to Denver spot how can they take fruit nuts and spices and turn them into something really exciting and I would get ideas from pies and cookies and cakes and I think okay\nHow do I take cherry pie and make it just in my quizzing are basically a raw raw and processed food and make it tastes like cherry pie or apple\nPie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining this because I Do a lot of cooking I'm and you're in your kitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and it's going to get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like [noise]\nBasically are raw raw and processed food and make it taste like cherry pie or apple pie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining this 'cause I Do a lot of cooking and you're in your kitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and you're just gonna get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like [noise] being like Dicky ball of a match\nAnd then you would like take it out with your hands in like a roll it out with a rolling\nTen and then um I got to cut her and I would like a guide her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own I'm a Jew many cash digital sort of asking parts to help you out in a year while you were not you know we're getting a salary how did you pay your bills um within\nAbout a week I realized oh I had I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought\nI'm gonna start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know yeah so whole foods opened their first store in Denver\nAt exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and they in in the neighborhood I grew up in actually and I thought huh I'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work and their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself this is really going to be the big deal like this is people are gonna want want by these\nDoing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works I I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself this is really going to be the big deal like this is people are gonna want one by these\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression so I first you know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say\nI Would buy this and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or she's going to work for a whole foods maybe I'll just do that\nAnd just just to clarify again our you just like sort of\nThe spin like binding greens and stuff and this is when you're using your own money\nYou know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious and all I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all kinds of green information in a month we'd go by and I would find out about\nA piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things and I would be so motivated and somebody want to buy bars and I make them at a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags in a little Chinese takeout box\nAnd and I would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow and then another month to go by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud\nManufacturing equipment or just little things\nAnd I would be so motivated it's somebody want to buy bars and I make them a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags in a little Chinese takeout box\nAnd and I would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow and then another month to go by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and\nThen I Would just get really motivated and nothing happened and this went on for the three year period between my idea phase and when I actually launched so\nI'm trying to figure out how you are maintained your uh your optimism and confident about all this because I mean you're thirty two you're divorced\nAnd I imagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of this plan and I don't know what like was part of you I mean did you ever get the feeling that people look you and think oh yeah that's Laura she's got this kind of weird side project\nA lot of people thought that I mean I Would see people I went to high school with and they would come into whole foods and\nYou know they ... they're dirty climbing the ladder big jobs in finance and all kinds of things and they say oh\nOh I didn't know you worked here and and people would see me and even if I had those moments with people were ... I Would notice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life and you have to go for it and embrace it and make it happen [noise]\nWhen\nWe come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen project into a business [noise] stay with us I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR and [noise]\nAnd this is Kay Jay's easy Ninety One point five\nFor it and embrace it and make it happen [noise] and when\nWe come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen project into a business [noise] stay with us I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR him\nAnd this is ...
