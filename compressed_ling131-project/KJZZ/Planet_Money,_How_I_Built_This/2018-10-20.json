about the Nineteen thirty Smoot Hawley tariffs which was really eye opening actually\nThe Smoot Hawley tariff yeah and it just sounds familiar it is because these really old terrorists made their way into a famous movie seen that scene from fares Mueller day off where the teacher being played by actor Ben Stein is giving this ethically boring lesson and he says\nYou're Nineteen thirty the Republican controlled house of representatives passed the anyone anyone\nThe tariff bill the Hawley Smoot tariff act which anyone raised or lowered raised tariffs in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government huh huh wow\nThese Smoot Hawley tariffs they are often considered the worst terror in us history and to tell the story of of how they got completely out of hand my colleagues Sally helm and I talk to economists Doug Irwin and we asked him who were these Smoot Hawley guys\nSo one of them sort of a tall and lean that would be um Reed Smoot and the others little

back to this special edition of Planet Money and how I built this from NPR I'm Kenny Malone\nAnd I'm Guy Raz and today we're sharing some of our favorite moments from our shows\n... and ... I wanted to talk about a moment from from one of your shows I I heard the story about the guy who started air BNB [noise] Ah yes Joe Gambia yeah Joe Joe ... and it occurred to me that it is so odd because the concept of how sharing today feels completely natural but\nLike ten years ago renting a room to a complete stranger in your house was like a little creepy so I like what happened what what happened in the meantime\nI mean ... ... happened you know when she was starting out he was kind of in a bind because he just graduated from college and he didn't have any money and his landlord and raise the rent and so she had to come up with a way to pay the rent you start to think about okay well how can we designed our way out of this\nAnd that was when I I selected on previous experience that I had back in Providence\nThe day before that I I I drove cross country I sold off all my stuff\nAnd when I was having that yard sale [noise] this kind of guy pulls up in the red ...\nAnd he starts looking at my stuff\nI'm getting pretty new ideas I'm ready to go home\nBut he ended up buying a piece of art that I was ... so we get\nAnd that was one I I reflected on a previous experience that I had back in Providence\nThe day before that I I I drove cross country I sold off all my stuff\nAnd when I was having that yard sale [noise] this kind of guy pulls up in the red moslem yada\nAnd he starts looking at my stuff\nI'm getting pretty noisy 'cause I'm ready to go home [noise]\nBut he ended up buying a piece of art that I was ... so we get to talking and he tells me all about\nHow he's about to go into the Peace Corps and driving cross country and he doesn't know a soul in Providence sewing bottom out for drinks at night and I make the mistake of asking him so where's day night\nAnd he makes it worse\nBy saying [noise] actually I don't have a place [laughter] and I'm thinking oh man\nYou got to give you do you have to a place like we've all been there I liked by hosts this guy so before I Know what I'm saying I'm like hey you can stay in an air but in my living room [noise] so that night I said I'm up in the living room and I I I go to bed and I tried to fall asleep I'm staring at the same thinking oh my God\nWhat have I done there was a complete stranger in my living room yeah what if you think so\nAs it turns out the guy was not psychotic an actor letting those guys stay in his living room Joe gets an idea that he just can't shake\nI'm looking at my laptop and there's a design conference it's coming to San Francisco the industrial designers conference right\nAnd on the conference website in big red letters said hotels sold out and I'm thinking oh man what a bummer designers want to come last minute they're not going to a place to stay in in that instant I look up and looking around the living room wait we\nHave so much extra space here and I have airbags in the closet and the idea of hosting people in their beds\nHad gradually become natural to me\nConference right and on the conference website in big red letters said hotels sold out and I'm thinking oh man what a bummer designers want to come last minute the knocking at the place to stay in in that instant I look up and looking around the living room wait\nSo much extra space here and I have an air but it's in the closet and the idea of hosting people in their beds at gradually become natural to me\nAnd the thinking is there'll be more than just the place to sleep we can cook breakfast in the morning we'll pick him up from the airport ah we'll give them a neighborhood guide and map to San Francisco so did how did you get the word out having the designers noted that this was available well we you know we didn't want to use any of the classified Web sites because there's going to be people in their home\nSo we made her own raining you may draw while we did on your own website but how do you design your own Web site that said what well it said who we were said about the concept of stay with us and we'll we'll provide these things for you um so this was it was just for the design conference that's it you mean for men do meant to be for one week\nAnd what did you call it the website it was literally called their bed and breakfast dot com\nAnd we started getting emails from around the world designers\nWho needed a place to stay emails from London from Brazil from Japan people actually started sending us their resumes they're linked in profiles to to vie for one of these these limited three Airbus ... and\nFor how much was it for eighty dollars a night you could stay in San Francisco with Brian and I that's a great deal it was amazing deal ... had this great quality he was persistent he visualized his idea and eventually it caught on\nAnd now ... is hugely successful at what point did you and Brad looked at each other and go okay man I think this is our business to that December\nEighty dollars a night you could stay in San Francisco with Brian and I that's a great deal making deal ... had this great quality he was persistent he visualized his idea and eventually it caught on\nAnd now ... is hugely successful at what point did you and Brian look at each other and go okay man I think this is our business to that\nDecember we both went home for holidays and at our respective New Year's eve parties everyone of asked so what are you doing in San Francisco say well we're entrepreneurs and well what do you watch ...\nAnd we didn't really have very much other than to say well let me talk about this time where we have to be three guests on earbuds in her apartment and one of two things happen\nPeople said oh my God that's the coolest thing in the world where can I Do that\nOr they said that is the most bizarre creepy I think I've ever heard and they left the conversation yeah and I think one of the things that I've learned is that great ideas\nI think they usually start out as polarizing they're not kind of like yeah that's kind of okay they either really tug on somebody's emotions or an elite and desire that they have that's never been answered before\nOr they really perturbed them in some way but as long as there's people who who really gravitate towards the idea to me that's a signal that there might be on something so you guys have have obviously\nGrown a bigger than than most or all hotel chains and you have some similar challenges to to companies like Hoover I'm with some cities saying hey you know you guys should be regulated like hotels um so how do you how do you respond to\nThat I think about that question in the context of innovations over the last hundred years and there are three examples that come to mind of new ideas entered the world that had a pretty rough start but are now so commonplace in every day that you'd laugh you thought like oh wow like people are against that at one point\nGuys should be regulated like hotels um so how do you how do you respond to that\nI think about that question in the context of innovations over the last hundred years and there are three examples that come to mind of new ideas entered the world\nThat had a pretty rough start butter now so commonplace and everyday that you'd laugh you thought like oh wow like people are against that at one point so ATM machines at one point and I think it was the Nineteen seventies [noise]\nWe're a had a lot of criticism and I think they're actually laws being written against them in certain states up to us because there's this new and different way of of banking or you'd have to go inside and in and talk with a\nYou know a person behind a desk ... maybe ... one of the services you just went to a you know a computer in the wall and and retrieved your money of course can imagine today without ATM machines no\nAh the VCR things another great example is first patented in the mid twenty century but it really didn't become a product until the the eighties early eighties\nBecause it was met with such resistance from incumbent industries that didn't want people to watch movies at home\nThe cars another example where when the model T came out in Nineteen relate I'm represented a new way to travel a new way to to a new form of transportation\nAnd there were certain cities that were against the car and they're actually uh laws drafted to um to you know outlaw cars but you know after you you're trying a new more efficient way of transportation or the people demanded that they didn't want to go back to a horse and buggy [laughter]\nAnd so the policymakers you know had to modify the laws to to what the people want it you know so yeah I think the world is ready for our invention given this has been over a hundred million people that have stayed in homes all over the world and the good news is that as cities come to\nOutlaw cars but you know after you you're trying a new more efficient way of transportation uh the people demanded that they didn't want to go back to a horse and buggy [laughter]\nAnd so the policymakers you know how to modify the laws to to what people want it yeah so yeah I think the world is ready for our invention given this has been over a hundred million people that have stayed in homes all over the world\nAnd the good news is that as cities come to learn about what we do and what we offer they they tend to want to work with us because they see that there is an economic economic impact that allows people in their cities are in different neighborhoods to uh to benefit [noise]\n\nThat's Joe ... the guy who started air BNB during his story makes me think about this thing that entrepreneur seem to be capable of doing that I simply cannot and it is like being positive forward thinking people who are great at identifying problems and coming up with a creative solution I'm always so envious of\nYeah and and the thing is not only did ... make him obviously a rich guy get also helped lots of people figure out how to make money on their own you know by renting their places\nThat we should say not all entrepreneurs ended up solving problems for other people this is true and you're at Planet Money and how I built this if we could solve the problem of paying for all of public radio by ourselves we wouldn't do that [noise] but our best Venus and his partner when you're building\nAnd gather we can make this happen\nGive right now
