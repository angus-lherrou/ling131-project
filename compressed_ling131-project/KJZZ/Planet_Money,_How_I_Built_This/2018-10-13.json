Ninety One point five times to do six and it's time for Planet Money\nYou're listening to Planet Money the other day I had an early morning interview and I ran downstairs to get a cup of coffee and ran into the guest so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of invited her with my my maybe we should say uh where are you\nA cat I sorry I don't know it might you might need to get my name is not easy by Catherine Rampell in town and sit and watch\nThe typically Catherine writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect place to show this thing that infuriates [noise] All right\nSo you're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nAnd I think I see [noise]\nHow much they went down to board a plane I\nAll right let on misleading [noise]\nSo maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it with Catherine sees here is one price on the board and then this extra hidden theme\nAnd on the board to eighty nine\nOr a little misleading\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it with Catherine sees here is one price on the board and then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it\nAnd it's not just taxes sometimes it's Steve in service charges that seemed to appear out of thin air at check out and drive us\nAll crazy booking rental cars buying concert tickets for like have you booked a hotel room recently sometimes there's an Internet the symptoms of the parking fee sometimes there's something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that is not a resort it's by the way\nThat it would Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompanies should be competing based on price and quality and not ...\nUh and the fact that companies do compete on ... did not create a better economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that are buying stuff that they don't want for every one is a used car salesman\nI have a very good friend who's a used car salesman so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nThe price should be the price [noise] that is how Catherine Rampell would make the world better with one simple week [noise]\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more

all rules of baseball I suppose\nYou know I propose some reforms Steve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the catch up rules yeah like you want to catch up with mustard on that guy is not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up Steve\nCan you give us the simplest explanation of the catcher parole\nThe one who's willing to blindly follow all rules of baseball I suppose uh no I propose some reforms Steve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the catch up rule yeah like guy you want to catch up what must it on that guy is not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up\nSteve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch up rule\nIn baseball and works as follows a that if you're the team ahead in an inning and you're a bad then you get only two outs rather than three out in that inning\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand\nWe went back to Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyze a each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the ketchup ... been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter with these games ... the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost a half an hour from a game a half an hour with the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime\nCritically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's also got uh\nPlanning attendance so how have fans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well\nCritically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest\nIn fact he tells us he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd be them only Eighteen seconds at the end of a game\nOn my God how you are a true iconoclast route [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much and don't\nGo to any baseball games anytime soon you might get\nBack to the launch

into deep dad you know over the years don't he killed his headache bowls slew of near death experiences\nBut it never quite died in fact it grew and grew into one of the most popular yogurt brands in the United states and one thing about starting fields cofounder of Gary Hertzberg is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company\nHe knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire his dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days there were probably fifty shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so so how\nMany people did your dad's company employee\nSeveral thousand I think at their peak they were to twenty eight hundred wow these are true company chance of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in the region in the country were were built on things that we made\nIn the dark side of that is that when they simply because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapse now all of these communities did as well and what happened to your family [noise] uh well it was really a three three for\nUh the family's business uh went bankrupt or my parents got divorced\nAnd my uh\nOf childhood role model a died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a\nIt was a wake up

influence on you did you did you start to think about a business about being a businessman ... at that early I mean you say your parents were\nBoth entrepreneurial no I I started thinking about running as far as I possibly could away from it\nYou know I obviously the bankruptcy didn't happen overnight it was a result of a steady decline and my my grandfather my father and my uncle we're all in the business and I used to sit [noise] or work in there and I would listen to them screaming at each other you know they were arguing you know uh I'm\nWere selling to about twenty stores and eventually we started selling to a\nAn independent grocer who had seven stores and um this will give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one Sunday night\nWe were having dinner at the ...\nAnd the phone rang and a ... the nephew of the\nOwner of the militias market basket and chain ... calls and says Samuel or why are you selling them by competitive and not to me that he had thirty four stores at the time is up and say well how to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cows he said well get some\nCows and he slammed the phone down and we took that is very good business advice so we went out and grew are hurt even further and then so we\nNow realize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed to lease a small refrigerator truck and started delivering actually to the market basket where warehouse\nHow much yogurt were you making at that point\nWe're producing now about three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt and a case like twenty four cups six ... six packs of court and so by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed in the sort of half a million dollar range but you\nWere probably spending more money than you are bringing

almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nIn those days as a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part a hopeless and they had one store in Cambridge and prospects street and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket this is now I'm Talking July of eighty\nFour and um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we can crack bread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to ... in the TPP with their ... do you know they didn't need another\nYou know organic yogurt from some crazy people in the hamster [laughter] ... what you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate\nTeam um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus on prospects in Cambridge and asked\nFor my yoga that was on a Sunday on\nWednesday Mary Carol Skinner the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof were getting all kinds of requests for yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first delivered that afternoon I'm about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circuses and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles as last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get it\nFor yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first delivered that afternoon [noise] um about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circus and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles as last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference to get people's miles and then they're going to ask\nFor it and and this is a right around the time you meet Meg he would become your wife right yeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no ... in northeastern farming association conference and I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and uh right after I finished my speech this very\nAdorable or organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there I waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state\nSo she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase since so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm it's because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some harbored MBA with with with a tie\nLater ... well I think we can increase since so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got to cross the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money for friends and family money mhm it's because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know\nSome Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money huh yeah yeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful\nOh yeah you know what happened in this farm house I I always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAnd by this point it was a half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking Meg was a sleep in our bedroom\nWhich was about fifty feet from my office I Would on many occasions tip toe over\nTo the office to call my mother in law to have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty five hundred to make ends meet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law's sun and Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well because she didn't have confidence and then\nIt will look she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out that the power would I mean we're on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere\nWas make thing do you listen to ditch this thing this bag\nIt I mean or or did she gives it sounds like maybe she didn't believe in it well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in it did you think that means you are you are what two three years into this thing\nIn in not only are you not making money you are in debt big that big time yeah [noise] well I'll\nThe hilltop farm a long way from anywhere was make saying do you listen to ditch this

fortunately probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere else to go [noise]\nYou know she had given up her job done on her farm in New Jersey and signed on to this crazy them enterprise but here's where the story if\nI Know that you think it couldn't get worse but as as a Lily Tomlin says it\nIt it it ... it it got a lot worse before it got worse okay what happened what happened well so now I'm going
