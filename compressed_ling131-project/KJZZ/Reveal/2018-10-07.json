statutes it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or a hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their tool box when they need it but it's like do you can has their own never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every

specifically for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the ... statute judges no longer decide how long a person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory

number what the da and his spokes men denied it\nThe da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have I never

almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFrom what you're saying it's like ... have the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always\nEmphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nRemiss if I had what I consider to be a prosecutor case and simply said I'm not going to prosecutors because I just don't agree with the law that's really not that my call that for you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nThat it is it is the law I think I have a responsibility to prosecutors if the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing in New Orleans [noise]\n\n\n... line is I'm just doing my job was he doing his job so differently\nThe facts in fact support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing in New Orleans [noise]\n\n\nKennedy ... lawn is I'm just doing my job was he doing his job so differently than any other da in

than I Am ... a coal\nOr criminal law specialist\nAnd I heard that really you go by ...\nMay be a Jew Jew a big you would do a ... a ...\nYou know this is my ... my war room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stacked by his computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nThey get calls the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing this but when Harry can it can do is\nWe'll

that's a junior [laughter]\nThis was his dad Harry ... senior\nHarry ... came into office he use multiple below two shows up in this shows is that that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of their that\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney Eric ... pledges to use the powers rivers offers to help her image or your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhibited crimes against decent citizen [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime is urging all over the country people were scared\nSounds like kind of played on that ... so he brought this law back from when ... when to start [noise]\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any first shot a third ... be convicted of any crime you shall be considered as I'm it's just a and B imprisoned at a labor for live\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line

between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges the habitual offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg\n[laughter]\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official\nBut he did offer a statement about princes case here a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert\nVoluntarily entered into a plea agreement and received a legal sense under Louisiana law if he believed himself not guilty he could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy said my hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself\nAnd eradicate his substance
