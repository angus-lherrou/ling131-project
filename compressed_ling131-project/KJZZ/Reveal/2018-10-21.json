thousand birds at Pitt forensic analysis showed they represented a hundred and Seventy two different species including many rare birds originally the migratory bird treaty act targeted hunters choppers and poachers\nBut in the Nineteen seventies the federal government started using it to crack down on industries that kill lots of birds unintentionally millions of birds were saved by by issuing a new legal opinion in December the Trump Administration stopped using the act that way\nAnd halted the fines and prosecutions\n\nThis was a triumph of industries influence I analyzed public lobbying records from twenty Seventeen that specifically mentioned the migratory bird treaty act\nThey show oil and gas industry groups paid lobbyists nearly a half million dollars to influence federal agencies in Congress other kinds of energy companies spent heavily to lobby on this to industry groups\nSent emails to Trump Administration appointees that the Interior Department one of those emails led me to Kathleen Saddam in her corner office on the twenty seventh floor of a skyscraper in downtown Denver it's not a particularly claim day but it's not bad you know so\nIt's a good deal Kathleen represents oil and gas producers that's the president of the western energy alliance\nShe downplayed the impact of her industry's lobbying on Trump appointees they did not need much prodding from us actually they were going down that path before we even talk to him last August Kathleen sent along wish list of environmental policies industry wanted the Trump Administration to weekend\nIt's a good view Kathleen represents oil and gas producers as the president of the western energy alliance\nShe downplayed the impact of her industry's lobbying on Trump appointees they did not need much prodding from us actually they were going down that path before we even talk to him last August Kathleen sent along wish list of environmental policies industry wanted the Trump Administration to weaken\nAmong them was the way the migratory bird treaty act was interpreted we were the ones who are being targeted she points out that the federal government ranks cats as the largest bird killers collisions with buildings come next do we prosecute those who live in buildings who happen to have a bird smashed into their window\nNo those are inadvertent bird deaths just like some times birds get into oil and gas equipment and deaths result as well for decades the federal government had argued that birds dying in oil pits was different than birds smashing into windows\nBecause companies could take steps to protect birds\nSome companies disputed this in court and in December Trump's top lawyer at interior sided with them and he wrote a legal opinion saying it's only a legal to kill migratory birds if it's done on purpose\nThe administration leader sent out a memo with examples if you are washing offshore oil platform to get rid of a bird's nest that's illegal\nBut if your power washing an offshore oil platform and the bird's nest happens to get washed away that's not illegal it's a reasonable way to continue to protect birds while moving forward with energy development with a new interpretation of the migratory bird treaty act\nThere will be no more fines and there will be no more prosecutions of industry when birds die at oil operations do you think that\nThat happens to get washed away that's not illegal it's a reasonable way to continue to protect birds while moving forward with energy development with a new interpretation of the migratory bird treaty act\nThere will be no more fines and there will be no more prosecutions of industry when birds die at oil operations do you think that more birds will die as a result of that I don't think more birds will die because companies don't\nNeed a rule or prosecution hanging over their head to do the right thing we want to protect birds nobody wants to see a dead bird main everybody loves her\nI tell Kathleen than in a couple of days I'm going to go flying over oil pits with former agents of the fish and Wildlife Service [noise]\nShe insists that will be nothing to see\nWe've gotten away from open pit most modern operations do not use open pets that again has taken away a source of potential bird deaths and will continue to operate in that matter [noise]\n\nWe're going to go ahead and just started up
