history and sometimes health history as well\nAggregated to harm us in some way\nVersus a kind of developing openness rate in revealing who really are and not having shame about that right so stigmas are falling away yet private data is becoming more valuable uh so those those are different pieces of privacy but they are moving in different directions\nSo fast forwarding a little bit um how do you think the rise of the Internet has affected pride\nSome way versus I'm a kind of developing openness rate in revealing who really are and not having gene about that right so stigmas are falling away yet private data is becoming more valuable uh so those those are different pieces of privacy but they're moving in different directions\nSo fast forwarding a little bit um how do you think the rise of the Internet has affected privacy both kind of real privacy and then like our perception of the privacy that we have\nUm so the Internet is it a huge topic for privacy of course I'm One of the things the Internet did was make opting out more difficult of giving away ones information of presuming that you intended to share and disseminate a your personal details unless you very carefully and deliberately opted out\nThat really rivers as Danah boyd who's written about this really nicely that really reversed a tradition where it was actually hard to get information it was hard to get information out and to circulate it it flip flop that\nSo that that was a hugely important part of the Internet and the way that it's intersected with privacy debates it also of course gave Americans who have long um many long wanted an audience of some kinds right and a kind of influence in reach\nExactly that gave them a platform for their blog for their thoughts for you know sharing their photographs of their meals [laughter] you know giving allowing their friends to see their movements it allowed people to do what they've been doing since the days of the postcard which is you know share information about themselves and\nAnd so those those two facets um again have come together and really powerful ways in the\nUh ability of now many many many people to look into and use that information in ways that we are not always intended of course by the people who put it out there to begin with\n[noise] let me just take a step out of history here for a minute ... will step back into it for a minute but I think in some ways people think of like history is a store\nTwo facets um again have come together and really powerful ways in the uh ability of now many many many people to look into and use that information in ways that we're not always intended of course by the people who put it out there to begin with\nAnd let me just take a step out of history here for a minute ... will step back into it for a minute but\nI think in some ways people think of like history is a story of privacy mean off straight you know your last summer with the with uh the telephone people can listen in to calls and the telegraph and then the Internet and you know and closed circuit TV cameras all over city that you just keep going and people know more and more about you\nBut in some sense if I if you think back to like medieval in London or something people living very close together walls being not very thick you can just hear what people are saying on the other side you know or people in living in very small villages in small communities where everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody's business\nIn some ways like tomorrow if I Walk through Rio or Beijing or like New York city but he would know who I was I mean I can walk through anonymously and maybe privately I mean in some ways I feel like\nYou could argue that we maybe have more privacy than we had hundreds of years ago [noise]\nI think this is what has missed off in in our contemporary debates this idea that the privacy of some things some quantity that was there once and is now gone and or eroding slipping for our fingers but no it's true that we live privately more privately in many ways than did people a couple of centuries ago\nIn terms of a White House construction ways that neighborhoods are designed homes are designed but also in terms of our very writes in our sensibilities sense of what should be private um has changed and so\nIt I think it's really a mistake to think about privacy is all moving them\nAnd or eroding slipping for our fingers but no it's true that we live privately more privately in many ways than did people a couple of centuries ago\nIn terms of a White House construction ways that neighborhoods are designed homes are designed but also in terms of our very writes in our sensibilities sense of what should be private um has changed and so\nIt I think it's really a mistake to think about privacy its own moving in one direction um this is what makes it hard to chart and hard to kind of place in any given point but\nIt's it's the exact and in certain ways even though perhaps we have less privacy in our communications today or around our personal information say um it's accessibility to others\nWe have more privacy I think in some ways in ways we live in a way we think about ourselves as private up people who ought not to have the state or neighbors peering in through our windows all\nThe time [noise] so what's your diagnosis of where we are now are we in like a lot less private than we were a hundred years ago\nDon't think so but I Do think that the substance of our privacy and our ideas about privacy rights have changed and changed in conjunction with all kinds of things technological developments date developments a commercial uh and so on architectural even\nI think if I were to describe our current moment I think what we're experiencing are two different trajectory is coming together and have created a lot of problems I'm One of them is the ability for many different agencies to know us very well um by matching emerging technologies\nThe other is this a impetus that many citizens have had since the Nineteen seventies to disclose more of their authentic selves on different kinds of media platforms those are coming together in ways that are I think um we're unanticipated and which have meant that there is a ton of information out there about us\nSome of it uh kept by record keepers some of it disclosed voluntarily by us\nBy matching emerging technologies\nThe other is this a impetus a that many citizens have had since the Nineteen seventies to disclose more of their authentic selves on different kinds of media platforms those are coming together in ways that are I think um we're unanticipated and which have meant that there is a ton of information out there about us\nSome of it uh kept by record keepers some of it disclosed voluntarily by us um\nAnd and then we've got we're in this technological and commercial moment where all of that is valuable to others\nAnd there are many many ways to harness it so those two things have come together they didn't they didn't necessarily have to come together but they have and I think that explains are a scandal late in the moment you know firm

director of Georgetown University's global social enterprise initiative she has spent years studying why certain movements achieved our objectives like the fight for gay marriage that campaign to expand gun rights and white others don't\nIt would not be supportive of Second Amendment rights\nSo let's talk about social movements that you think as you kinda look for where here might be strengthening\nSo let's talk about social movements that you think as you kinda look for where here might be strengthening in their power we talked a little bit about gun control advocates in that vein is there anything else that strikes you\nI think about a lot about the me too movement with all that's going on in the headlines these days\nAnd certainly from a grassroots perspective as you have more women coming out and just exposing themselves to the scrutiny and the hatred that they often are up against on the side of transparency and saying this happened to and and there's a lot of strength in numbers\nYou know what's interesting about me too is that the challenges around gender equality sexual harassment sexual assault there isn't a policy or a law that can necessarily change things at this point if you think about it and most workplaces except for a few exceptions\nYou know sexual harassment sexual abuse is illegal right what you need to do is change social norms\nSo if you think about one of the successful movements we studied in her book the anti drunk driving movement led by mad mothers against drunk driving like you know there is no policy or law that says you have to have a designated driver\nBut because mad both tried to enforce existing laws they also put forth a campaign around\nFriends don't let friends drive drunk and that was actually invented by a group in Canada but mad had the chapters in the local presents to be able to make that go viral you know decades before we had Internet and things we'd go instantly viral and it became the norm\nThat says you have to have a designated driver but\nBecause mad both tried to enforce existing laws they also put forth a campaign around friends don't let friends drive drunk and that was actually

the norm that if you're at a party and you see your friends had one too many you don't let them back drunk you take their kids designated driver\nThat the social norm shift to behavior change so when you look at me too I think a lot of this is incumbent upon men in positions of power who are the ones that can enforce their peers\nTo not engage in abusive um types of behaviors that movement thinking about what\nHow do we actually shift the norm becomes apparent and then there's you know other things you can do as well like continuing to advocate and push for nondiscrimination laws having more women in positions of leadership and power\nIs the number one way to prevent these types of things from happening as well and you still have vast inequalities at that level [noise]\nMostly ... is

race\nThe story here is that a few years back there is a a farmer rancher in West Texas in arid west Texas a by the name of William yet Jeff Williams\nWilliams and his family had their rights to a ton of water in Texas did they can pump out of the awkward for under their land no matter how dry Texas Scott\nStory here is that a few years back there is a a farmer\nRancher and a west Texas in arid west Texas a by the name of Williams Jeff Williams\nWilliams and his family had their rights to a ton of water in Texas that they can pump out of the aquifer under their land no matter how dry Texas got ... the state Supreme Court had told them\nAnd what it basically comes down to is that an individual landowner has the right to literally pull up as much water as they possibly can as long as it's used for quote more or less beneficial purposes and\nThat's the end of it boils down to whoever has the biggest pump wins in the Williams is among the the bigger pumps\nMcGraw is the author of a Thursday and land the making of an American water crisis he said that what Jeff Williams could not do by law we ship the water to other people who needed it\nEven when drought began to play in Texas in two thousand ten and even when that drought was forcing some farmers to abandon their crops Jeff Williams thought the situation was curious to say the least\nHe reads the newspaper that well you know what forty thousand acres or rice or being let go oh I'm a I'm a far you know what I'm going to do I'm going to raise rice in the district now to be fair it was only a small part it was only a few acres was a test plots [noise]\nIt was more to make a point than it was to actually make a profit\nPoint was that despite the fact that race is generally grown and places like south east Asia

not just in case\nWas more to make a point but it was to actually make a profit\nThe point was that despite the fact that race is generally grown in places like south east Asia where monsoons dot the landscape with rain the Williams is could grow rice in the desert\nIn the middle of a drought and not McGraw argues tells us I'm mocked about where we're headed with water not just in Texas but in the country as a whole\nYou have the abdication of a federal to the state the abdication of the state to the local and ultimately the abdication of the local to the individual and that becomes I think that's a powerful challenge and\n... response to this challenge is instructive for how the rest of us are going to respond to the challenges for fish\nWhat we're facing as a nation increasingly played by both lack of water droughts forest fires and too much water much of it unsafe for contaminated\nUp until now water has been a classic government versus the individual struggle in America politics by another name but it can't stay that way McGraw says when we're struggling to find enough water for people in lots of American cities Las Vegas Los Angeles Phoenix something's got to get\nIn Texas for him most clearly encapsulates that lesson\nYou it's not an accident that for much of the southwest for example\nWhen they first became part of the United states they were very sparsely populated

conditioning there could be no El Paso there could be no there could be no San Antonio today\nWere it not for the technological advancements that have taken place and particularly took place in the
