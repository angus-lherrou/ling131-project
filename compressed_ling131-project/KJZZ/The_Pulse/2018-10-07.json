listeners who support this NPR station\n\nWelcome to innovation how I'm Karen Miller\nWas the last few months in large chunk of my conversations has veered towards a single topic after a while I got a little obsessed with the topic and he started asking people about it directly that generally unless it is seizing drones and comments that sounded a little like that\nI feel serious that's about it that's all I can describe it as it's just pure theory\nI feel very um cost of food I feel angry you feel a little bit on patients uh it's really stressful\nI Am initially angry and then I settle in and say turn of the tunes good spot to fire going and just relax it's either that or take advantage and I don't have a prescription yet from\nThose were commuters we tracked down in Atlanta and Chicago and they're talking of course about traffic\nSomething that affects the health mental state wallets family life and worked options as so many Americans which kind of makes you wonder could traffic be fixed or is it just destined to track us in our cars for more and more times each year\nThere's general agreement the congestion in our major urban areas is getting worse\nMichael ... is an associate professor of urban planning at UCLA Luskin school of public affairs his focus is traffic and he says if you live in or near a major urban area you probably spend a chunk of your day in gridlock\nAngeles New York Washington DC\nEach year there's general agreement the congestion in our major urban areas is getting worse\nMichael ... is an associate professor of urban planning at UCLA Luskin school of public affairs his focus is traffic and he says if you live in or near a major urban area you probably spend a chunk of your day in gridlock\nLos Angeles New York Washington DC that metropolitan area San Francisco Boston\nChicago Atlanta in general the bigger and denser city you are the more traffic congestion your roads have\nRush hour to expand it as we try to avoid driving at the worst times a day stresses grown as people grapple with the unpredictability of traffic so when they can take thirty minutes to get to work in the next day takes fifty and that costs don't end there\nOne of the most under appreciated impacts of traffic congestion is the pollution that results from it\nWhen vehicles are idling and moving slowly are just going stop and go around ten to Fifteen miles an hour they admit much more pollution or they met more carbon and which is sort of matters for climate change and sort of these global concerns\nBut at a local level they're likely to him that much more sort of what we call local admissions or the or local pollutants like fine particulate matter or benzene and things like that and these have been strongly associated with increases in asthma increase in other respiratory diseases or increases and cancer\nAnd most especially increases in a premature birth and low birth weight\nThose costs Mandel says are mostly born by people whose homes are between five hundred and a thousand feet from the congested road which means that not all of the costs associated with traffic are paid by people who drive a lot\nOf the drivers who suffer from last time it's the drivers who suffer from stress it's the drivers who suffer from most crashes\nA premature birth and low birth weight\nThose costs Mandel says are mostly born by people whose homes are between five hundred and a thousand feet from the congested road which means that not all of the costs associated with traffic are paid by people who drive a lot\nOf the drivers who suffer from last time it's the drivers who suffer from stress it's the drivers who suffer from most crashes but you also have people who just live near freeways and those folks tend to be a much lower income than the population at large and they breathe or very polluted air\nThere's a reason why we don't have chronic shortages of those good ...\nWhere we don't have blackouts every day we don't have the toilets backup every day we don't have massive shortages of heating fuel every day a big part of the reason for that is that we allocate those things by price right\nWe don't say you can have as much electricity as you want go for it and just see how it works out\nExactly and we ... and so we understand that to efficiently allocate those vital pieces of infrastructure um\nEvery day we don't have the toilets backup every day we don't have massive shortages of heating fuel every day a big part of the reason for that is that we allocate those things by price right\nWe don't say you can have as much electricity as you want go for it and just see how it works out\nExactly and we ... and so we understand that to efficiently allocate those vital pieces of infrastructure\nUm we need to price them we also understand that putting those prices in place can be a big burden for some folks who don't have a lot of money and that's why it virtually every state every utility has some sort of lifeline program\nWhere they take money paid by folks who can afford it and use it to help subsidize access to the goods for people who have less money there's absolutely no reason that we couldn't do the same thing with congestion prices\nHow do you know it works and where has it been tried like where could I go to see that\nOkay so I think there's two ways to think about this one is that if you just think conceptually about what traffic congestion is\nThen you you understand the pricing is the only thing that solves that problem so again if you understand the congestion results because of very valuable asset is under priced and so as a result too many people want to use it at a particular time\nThan just logically the only thing that is going to ameliorate that\nIs making it more expensive at that time ...\nSo that's like sort of just the the logical or conceptual basis behind it if you want to see it in action Singapore has used some version of congestion pricing\nSince Nineteen Seventy five I Believe wow and it has used sort of more sophisticated electronic road pricing since the late Nineteen nineties early to thousands of Singapore is a very dense city it's dancers in San Francisco it's freeways move pretty\nSo that's like sort of just the the logical or conceptual basis behind it if you want to see it in action Singapore has used some version of congestion pricing\nSince Nineteen Seventy five I Believe wow and it has used sort of more sophisticated electronic road pricing since the late Nineteen nineties early to thousands of Singapore is a very dense city it's denser than San Francisco\nIt's freeways move pretty consistently at fifty five or sixty miles an hour oh you can also see examples of this along certain\nWhat we call high occupancy toll lanes throughout the United states that's our Ninety One roadway in in orange county for instance is a great example it's congestion priced roadway that sits in the middle of a free freeway in orange county okay and\nDuring rush hour you will see traffic snarled in the free lanes and zipping right along at fifty five sixty miles an hour in the price planes\nA variant of congestion pricing is it at work in places like London and stock home where driving into the center of the city and this is not freeways but this is driving into the downtown you encourage charged to do so\nAnd that has been very successful as well the first day of London's congestion charging traffic delay went down by about thirty five percent\n[noise] so this is an issue that crosses party lines it's not part isn't isn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican if you're you know stuck in traffic every morning\nOn but I have not heard a lot of politicians talk about it do you see we've kind of a local thing but do you see mayors are governors I'm Talking about this doing congestion pricing really trying to uh make people's commute a better\nSo congestion is absolutely a much bigger priority at the local and sometimes the state level than it is at the national level right it's not something that the national government has a lot\nDo you see we've kind of a local thing but you see mayors governors I'm Talking about this doing congestion pricing really trying to uh make people's commute a better\nSo congestion is absolutely a much bigger priority at the local and sometimes the state level than it is it's a national level right it's not something that the national government has a lot of concern or authority over\nAnd it's also just not something that even if you look at polls you know if you ask them to American in a Gallup poll or something like his congestion bad they say yes but if you ask them like name the top three problems in your region\nOnly in a handful of reagents this congestion rank really high mhm so I think it becomes much more an issue that mayors and city council members are and in smaller states like Massachusetts governors tackle and the question of you know\nDo I see these little acted officials embracing congestion pricing\nWhat I Would say optimistically is that more people are willing to talk about it now than they were ten years ago\nI think it's a hard political cell I mean this is people are very accustomed to the roads being free\nThey're also very accustomed to unfortunately policymakers having told them to other things would solve congestion\nBeing told that because we're building transit or adding road capacity the problem was going to get better so I think it's been difficult to sort of go back on that and say actually we were wrong the only thing that's going to solve this is pricing\nBut I I'm optimistic that as more and more places many of them outside the United states uh experiment with this mayors in the United states will look around and say you know [noise] there's no reason we shouldn't be\nPart of the success [noise] Michael ... is an associate professor of urban planning at the UCLA unless

of paradoxically it can be a really good thing for you so you know it can motivate people to be good parents to be good students whatever um but she also said it's got this dark side which he called hubris stick pride so here she is talking about that\nTo our research shows that people who tend to feel this kind of hubris to pride have problematic friendships right they they have trouble making friends and keeping friends because really what they value more is boosting themselves up at the expense of their friends so they'll put others down to feel good about themselves they'll have aggressively to try to get power and control\nAnd so the result of that is behaviors that can be really destructive like cheating in line [noise] jak Lewis\nI'm probably as one of those really
