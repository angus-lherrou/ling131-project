people there is no single defining moment in their lives for Hugh Thompson a funeral director from Stone Mountain Georgia there was [noise]\nAnd I was only in his twenties when the moment came and it was the moment that went to find him for good and bad for the rest of his life\nIt was Nineteen sixty eight Thompson was in the U.S army and not surprisingly he was stationed in Vietnam and on march sixteenth can inking sixty eight he was looking for the enemy from a helicopter\nWhat he found with Americans killing noncombatants in an area where poor peasants mostly farm to rice Thompson had

adults risk of metabolic syndrome obesity hypertension clinical depression schizophrenia all of those are significantly modulated modeling prenatal environment in other words like all sorts of things

I'm I'm less impressed grew genes than many people are\nBecause they don't make any sense and they're not meaningful outside the context of the environment which may occur\nRight and this notion that there's a bucket that's sort of genetic back it and the cultural back it it sounds like not at all they're just there's so much porous between those buckets that you can directly you you can't separate one from the other exactly\nYou're listening to innovation have him carrying the alarm talking with Robert supposed to be a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford he's the author of the have the biology of humans at our best and worst [noise]\nSo we talked about culture we've talked about genetics if both of those have tremendous power very often beyond your control you you don't change the culture you're ... you grow up in usually you obviously cannot control your genetics\nWhat does that say to you about free well and our ability to shape our own lives\nWell if you spend enough time looking at how we are shaped by everything from\nThe ... century stimulus ten seconds ago to why humans evolved a way they are rather than being chimps urban ... everything in between you spend enough time with that\nWe need to shape our own lives well if you spend enough time looking at how we are shaped by everything from\nThe ... century stimulus ten seconds ago to why humans evolved the way they are rather than being chimps urban ... everything in between you spend enough time with that\nAnd you know that concept of free will start seeming mighty suspect ... one can argue till the cows come home with certain branches of philosophers but in terms of that I come out as what's turned to hard determinist I don't think there's a shredder free will out there\nUm I think free will is what we call the biology that hasn't been uncovered yet\nAnd when you look at the history of our knowledge about what biology has to do with the behavior\nWe've spent the last ... I don't know a couple of centuries or so over and over repeating the same phrase which is whoa I had no idea that sort of biology had anything to do with it\n... I had no idea that an epileptic seizure\nIs a disease rather than someone who's been consulting with Satan mhm oh I had no idea circa Nineteen fifties that a child has a lot of trouble learning to read rather than being lazy and an motivated has the cortical mal formations that we now call a learning disability and when you look at\nThe sheer percentage of what we know\nAbout the biological shaping of our behavior\nYou know Ninety five percent of it was discovered in the last half century Ninety percent of in the last twenty five years eighty five percent since he woke up this morning and all that has been happening is this endless march of oh I had no idea of biology had to do with that\nSheer percentage of what we know about the biological shaping of our behavior\nNinety five percent of it was discovered in the last half century Ninety percent of in the last twenty five years eighty five percent since you woke up this morning and all that has been happening is\nThis endless march of oh I had no idea of biology had to do with that and it is already convinced is of than some of our most fundamental areas\nAnd at the end of the day either you could conclude there's no free will whatsoever and that's my stance\nOr at least you're going to have to admit there's a lot less free will than there used to be\nIn sort of western thinking and western values and judgments\nAnd it's getting squeezed into all sorts of really uninteresting places and that's just going to keep happening and maybe down the line if you want to insist it was free will while you've lost your upper teeth this morning instead of your lower ones go for it be happy but\nI think by all logic again this notion free will is just the biology we haven't discovered yet\nDoes that mean you must think that all the time in your own life you know am I really do think it'd be interesting primates are if they maintenance of aging and again and I really choosing not to eat that cookie or is that already kind of baked into like who I mean do you think that all the time in your own life\nWill ... that's the problem um you know mid again I'm totally intellectually comfortable with the notion that there is no free will whatsoever it's a myth we are nothing more or less than our biology at the same time I haven't the remotest idea\nHow you're supposed to live a few actually started believing Andre there's obvious things to do which is completely revamp\nWell that's the problem um you know mid again I'm totally intellectually comfortable with the notion that there is no free will whatsoever it's a myth we are nothing more or less in our biology at the same time I haven't the remotest idea\nHow you're supposed to live a few actually started to believe in and to me\nObvious things to do which is completely revamp\nHow we do criminal justice and education and all sorts of other things like that\nBut at the end of the day like you know without question I showed that I'm a total hypocrite and there's not really incorporate the game shows like if I give a lecture and somebody comes up afterward and says oh good lecture\nI'll say thanks how safe is what I'm supposed to say no actually it's this amount to you I have my having adequate protein levels as a fetus and this and this and this guy called ...\nRight yeah yeah and like how do you function that way I'm a certain level\nIf it's good to be hard for us to accept that there is no free will when it comes to judging them and they're awful behaviors um it's going to be that much harder she acceptance absolutely justice applicable when it comes to us in our laudable once\nI Want to go back to something that you just mentioned the criminal justice system so believing what you do how do you think about this and it's all about choices people make and then how other people obviously choose to punish them or not punish them uh for for what they did\nWell not not to sound like too much of a hot here as if I haven't already but let's see just to sort of stayed at subtly the criminal justice system makes no sense whatsoever there's there's no souls there's no evil\nAnd then how other people obviously choose to punish them or not punish them at for for what they did\nWell not not to sound like too much of a hothead here as if I haven't already but\nLet's see just to sort of state it subtly the criminal justice system makes no sense whatsoever\nThere's there's no souls there's no evil there's no there's no punishment that in and of itself I mean none of this stuff makes sense that the criminal justice system runs on neurobiology that's close to two hundred years old\nLiterally in what's called McNaughton ruling the difference of knowing between right and wrong and other than that for the most parts ignored the last two hundred years of behavioral science\nTwenty five percent of the men on death row in this country has a history of concussive head trauma to their frontal cortex\nAnd when you damage the frontal cortex\nUs somebody who can know the difference between right and wrong and they still can't regulate their behavior and when they do something appalling at that point\nInvoking evil it makes much sense as invoking the notion of evil on a car who's breaks the failed hit somebody ... and in both cases\nYou don't leave him out on the street being dangerous but when you put a car and the garage because he can't fix the brakes and dangerous you don't sit there and say justice has been served\nAnd this car is not going to get to drive around in the countryside anymore on a sunny day it's just\nA mechanical problem and in a horribly simplified way we're biological machines and\nIf it's humanizing to turn this into machines in that way it's a hell of a lot better than demonizing us into having rotten souls when we may just have something screw with one or a transmitter system is at the\nCountryside anymore on a sunny day is just\nA mechanical problem and in a horribly simplified way we're biological machines and if it ... to turn this into machines in that way it's a hell of a lot better than demonizing us into having rotten souls when we may just have something screw with one or transmitter system\nIn some ways at the argument that you make really affects huge swaths of our culture it seems to me and like\nI think about the entire section of a book store right that's designed to help you succeed more in life so that the you know books to help you find that to help you succeed at word books to help you do well in school I can make friends better and\nBut there is no need for that section if it's pre determined whether you're going to succeed at work or you're going to make friends or you're not\nWill but nonetheless you've got to incorporate the fact and their behavior changes yeah and it's not\nDetermined to stick in the sense that like the puritan neurobiologist would have set a Plymouth Rock or something right right but it's instead in a much more interesting hopeful way for example\nI'm conventional language that we would use you sit there and you hear about the story of Hugh Thompson and you come out of their inspired right inspired\nHeated something amazing my inspired\nThere was nothing extraordinary about his upbringing\nInspired five minutes before that he was no more amazing when you were me put his pants on one leg at a time is it your wow maybe I could be more like Hugh Thompson ... so we've just given sort of in English description of what it is to be inspired by somebody\nWhat does that neural biologically and the fact that a human can do what he did\nAbout his upbringing inspired five minutes before that he was no more amazing when you were me put his pants on one leg at a time it's a tree while maybe I could be more like Hugh Thompson ... so we've just given sort of in English description of what it is to be inspired by somebody\nWhat does that neuro biologically and the fact that a human can do what she did\nAnd the fact that you just heard about it\nMight very well change something in your ... and two and a half more neurons than we're working this way this morning are now involved in a sense of Africa see ... and doing the right thing when it's the terrifying thing to do\nWhen you were inspired when you're demoralized when you're deflated when you're bored by something those are as biological phenomena as anything else and they leave their traces so the fact that\nUm men in the early Nineteen hundred to owned an amusement park\nAnd he actually use the power that corporations had gained a to protect his own civil rights and so the man who own the amusement park\nOr with African American and he was sued by folks in Virginia who were saying and this and we don't want all these African Americans coming into our neighborhood to go to this amusement park\nAnd the owner was actually able to defend himself\nBecause corporations had such extensive rights or do you wanna talk about that case\n[noise] sure it was a case involving like you say an amusement park for African Americans in Virginia back at around the turn of the century and the local neighbors sued or trying to put the amusement park out of business\nBecause they said on the African Americans were not allowed to buy the land that the amusement park was located on okay with that in the law that average or not allowed to buy that land\nWas not the law so that African Americans couldn't bought a land it was there were restrictions in the deed of the land okay that you could not be sold to African Americans okay okay um this was a racially restrictive covenant a common place way in which racial segregation was enforced in America and the Jim Crow era\nAnd the court nonetheless ruled in favor of the amusement park saying that uh the amusement park was not owned by African Americans was owned by a corporation corporation may have been run by African Americans but the corporation had no race itself the court said I'm\nA and a really highlights and interesting and unexpected phenomenon I found in looking at the history of corporate rights is that\nIn many ways it the rights of corporations became tied up with questions of race slavery and civil rights\nJust like almost anything else in American history\nWas owned by a corporation corporation may have been run by African Americans but the corporation had no race itself the court said I'm a and a really highlights an interesting an unexpected phenomenon I found in looking at the history of corporate rights is that\nIn many ways it the rights of corporations became tied up with questions of race slavery and civil rights\nJust like almost anything else in American history\nTo go back to Mitt Romney that that famous quote you know corporations are people\nCouldn't you argue and I I guess corporations' probably has that you know look corporations are a collection of people and um their interests you know when they fight for their interests whether it's talking about terrorists or whatever it is\nThey are fighting to keep their workforce to not have to lay people off to be profitable to share those profits um\nIsn't that in some you know I think ... you know people derided Mitt Romney but isn't that a reasonable way to look at things that corporations are a collection of people and they're trying to act in their best interest\nIs exactly the way the Supreme Court has tended to view corporations over the course of American history indeed for all the controversy over corporate personhood\nCitizens United never relies on that idea at all and in fact what I find in my book is that\nIf you look at the history of Supreme Court cases extending rights to corporations\nWe find that most of those cases the Supreme Court rejects the idea of corporate personhood and says instead the corporations are associations of people\nAnd that people come together in the corporate form and they shouldn't lose their rights when they do so but there are some interesting questions about who really belongs to the corporation when Hobby Lobby refuses to provide birth control is required under federal law\nIn health care plans for employees\nUm that's you know ten thousand\nCourt rejects the idea of corporate personhood and says instead the corporations are associations of people and that people come together in the corporate form and they shouldn't lose their rights when they do so but there are some interesting questions about who really belongs to the corporation\nWhen Hobby Lobby refuses to provide birth control is required under federal law\nAnd health care plans for employees\nUm that's you know ten thousand female employees who are adversely affected by that there isn't a that is made by a to pursue the interests of the four or five owners of the Hobby Lobby company um whose interest really should be a recognized the the people who've contribute the money or the people who contribute to labor and everything else\nCan you imagine a whole bunch more cases coming down the pike like as more CEOs\nGet active and get involved um I think a bank of America that just a few months ago said they don't want to finance companies that that make a weapons like the Arab Fifteen ah we've seen Patagonia sue the Trump Administration over a national monuments protection national monuments\nI just wonder if there's going to be a whole new crop of these cases that tests the power of corporations\nWe're really seeing a flourishing of corporate rights cases and we're seeing lawsuits brought against graphics cigarette warnings we're seeing lawsuits brought against conflict mineral disclosures under the securities laws\nAnd and do you buy one study a full fifty percent of all First Amendment cases brought today are brought by corporations and trade associations that represent them\nAdam Winkler is a law professor at UCLA he's the author of the new book we

the American navy\nAnd by the time he got sick it was clear that his illness was part of an epidemic sweeping the clothes and know that\nAssistant secretary whose name was Franklin Delano Roosevelt did get better already actually went on to contract polio a few years later the illness that sickened him in Nineteen Eighteen reshaped our world it was the Spanish flu which might not roll off your

the first and Second World wars come by\nSo what happened was they would stop out with the same symptoms of flu that you and I know in a normal flu season if we're unlucky sore throat fever headache and then the unlucky minority would start to have trouble breathing they would ten blue in the face would tend to black\nAnd at that point and it was really no chance of recovery on it depended on the individual but to take hours or days um but they would die\nWorst ... is the author of the book pale writer the Spanish flu Nineteen Eighteen and how it changed the world and she says by the time the flu came along the world had been at war for years and people were exhausted\nA lot of people thought they were in a sort of so dumb and ... and you know that it was the end they had it was I should this huge um punishment from\nGo the Spanish flu which by the way it was not Spanish it was called Spanish because Spain printed more information about the flu than many other countries\nIt killed at least thirty times more people than die in a regular flu season it also altered the way we think about all sorts of things from viruses to preparing for pandemics so the Spanish flu something that
