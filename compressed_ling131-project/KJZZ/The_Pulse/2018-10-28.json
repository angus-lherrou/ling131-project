those three states would have voted for Hillary Clinton if their use robots have been just two percent lower\nAnd if it happens she'd be the president this week we'll talk to folks who don't agree at all as to whether the problem with the economy and all the political fallout that it's\nCaused is technology or whether the real problem is us first up Brian Alexander has chronicled has several swing

particularly focusing on Ohio which is where you're from and obviously we're right up against another election right now what's your sense of whether anything has changed in the last couple of years\n... yes I I I mean I think some attitudes have changed somewhat I think ah speaking specifically about Donald Trump I think there is\nSome chagrin among some people who voted for Trump in states like Ohio who are not pleased with his behavior\nOn the other hand I think there is a reluctance\nTo sort of admit to that because so many\nPeople you know who are very broadly generalize over generalize as the the so called elite or the coastal elites or whatever have been telling people that they made this huge mistake and so there's a there's a big reluctance to admit they made a mistake it's sort of like when you've been swindled nobody wants to open up to it\nSo I think there's still a lot of support for Donald Trump or almost as an act of defiance against people who\nAre doing well you know often there's this uh mocking among some of my colleagues frankly about the you know they talk about oh an economic and security wink wink nudge nudge when it was really racism or something else\nThe fact is it's not just economic and security it's insecurity about everything it's cultural insecurity gets insecurity about money and politics and where they stand in the world now\nUh the ground has shifted under their feet that feeling is still there in these places and in fact might be stronger than ever ...\nAnd you write about a steady that estimated that close to seven hundred

new on the scene will technology obviously\nExcept says historian Lewis Hyman not really he says American businesses have loved the idea of freelancing for a long time not just in this era of Internet startups and very low unemployment rates\nAnd the shift in the economy that we're seeing not about tack it's about us and the choices we make\nLewis timing is an associate professor of economic history at Cornell University he's the author of temp\nHell American work American business in the American dream became temporary Lewis thanks for your time a real pleasure to be here thank you so when you hear people say things and I'm sure this comes across a your dirt desk every now and again but people saying you know like\nShe because of the Internet you know so much work is now cobbled together and there's not that much security there's so much freelancing [noise]\nWhat do you think when you hear that kind of complaint\nIt's really interesting to me because there's a way in which technology acquires sort of an air of inevitability that there's nothing that can be done this is just the future it's algorithms futuristic robots and in the book I really push back against us pretty strongly\nThat technology is neutral it's solved\nWhat do you think when you hear that kind of complaint\nIt's really interesting to me because there's a way in which technology acquires sort of an air of inevitability that there's nothing that can be done this is just the future it's algorithms and futuristic robots and in the book I really push back against us pretty strongly\nThat technology is neutral it solves business problems tech doesn't drive change it consolidate said\nAnd things that you think happened in the last few years that are being driven by apps are really the byproduct of you know the rise of a certain kind of service economy that has been insecure increasingly insecure and unequal for quite some time\nAnd so you wouldn't say then I guess that technology has always driven things may think people think like\nTechnology is the reason we had the industrial revolution right that if the ... you hadn't had automatic looms then that never would have happened in that the Internet is like I said you know the reason that all this temporary work has happened ... you just sort of don't buy that argument\nI doubt it I don't think many historians do either it's really important to realize and it's and it's a story we're told so there's a reason why people think it's not just because they're confused if they're just to destroy we're told the story of progress the story of technology you know the cotton gin and the steam engine and the railroad\nBut before all that was made possible there was a social reorganization of people are from their homes into the factories\nAnd the what historians called industrious revolution which preceded the industrial revolution by about a hundred years the ... revolution the industry is robbing people became suddenly moral and hardworking [laughter] uh but that they were\nPut into rooms together and supervised and you know they were weaving texts\nOf people are from their homes into the factories\nAnd the what historians call the industry is revolution which preceded the industrial revolution by about a hundred years the ... revolution the industry is Rob a bank not people became suddenly moral and hardworking but that they were\nPut into rooms together and supervised and you know they were leaving textiles they were\nYou know making pots pottery and it had nothing to do with technology and how to do is simply\nOrganizing people in a row and watching them this is where Adam Smith famous example of pin manufacturing came from right it wasn't you know the idea of division of labor that you know one person could make you know fewer I tend to make a PIN we could make like three pinned I could make zero pins I'm not very\nGood I can make you know all that that might lead to more what we are doing\nExactly but if you sit down thirty people and you break down that process and the separate step suddenly oh maybe I can I can definitely hit something in a certain way again and again and again and that these Skilling of work that division of labor this is the foundation of\nCapitalism and a lot of ways it's one of the foundations of capitalism\nAnd this is what we're seeing today that the corporation fundamentally was reorganized sometime or between Nineteen Seventy Nineteen eighty\nIn a new way that created more insecure lives for the rest of us and ... is the waste product of that service economy it's the it's only possible because the rest of our work lives at Starbucks and Wal Mart are so bad\nSo if what you're saying is in some sense factories were created before the kinds of factories we think about where so many things are automatic and electric powered talk about then how the gig economy was there before even before the Internet forget Hoover\n... it's the it's only possible because the rest of our work lives at Starbucks and Wal Mart or so bad\n... so if what you're saying is in some sense factories were created before the kinds of factories we think about where so many things are automatic and electric powered\nTalk about then how the gig economy was there before even before the Internet forget Hoover and the Internet ever came on but it was really there before\nAbsolutely so in the book I talk about temp jobs and by temp jobs I mean jobs that are loosely affiliated with a corporation or a workplace and you can see him and all kinds of ways from consultants which are well paid to temps which are run through an agency to migrant laborers\nOr which are pretty much shut out of any kind of legal protections or workplace rights so\nThe story really begins after World War two when the first temp agencies come to being in the first\nConsulting fees really come to the foreground so here I'm Talking about manpower incorporated is the four four runner the temp agency and McKinsey and company as a foreigner of consultants and of course at the same time the ... program which brought guest workers from Mexico to the U.S for the very first time\nTalk a little bit about manpower a which\nIs still going strong it's a company that exist today but it started in the Nineteen forties before we think about the gig economy just talking about like the guy you started it and what it was hoping to do and sort of how it ended up changing America\nSo all these different kinds of temp work really worry about supporting that postwar corporation that was focused on security focused on stability and long term jobs and so the founder of manpower incorporated Elmer winter was a lawyer\nIn Milwaukee and one day he had a crisis where he needed a secretary to type up\nHoping to do and sort of how it ended up changing America\nSo all these different kinds of temp work really whereabouts supporting that postwar corporation that was focused on security focused on stability and long term jobs and so the founder of manpower incorporated Elmer winter was a lawyer\nIn Milwaukee and one day he had a crisis where he needed a secretary to type up some legal notes\nAnd he didn't have one so he\nCalled around you couldn't find somebody and he realized that this was not a problem this was an opportunity like so many entrepreneurs and so he spouted manpower as a way to supply emergency replacement labor for\nBusiness executives and for companies and this was a tremendous growth business they exploded through the Nineteen fifties\nBy the Nineteen end of the Nineteen fifties he realized there was a limit to how often secretaries got sick or ... you know people went on vacation and you begin to imagine a different kind of workforce of workforce that could come in as needed that can be a permanent like temporary workforce\nAnd yet people didn't do it and they didn't do it because of the reasons they didn't have the experience with it they trust of the people that they knew and they didn't quite believe that that was the purpose of the company the purpose of the company was to provide security to provide long term investments and all the things that are missing in the meaning of the corporation today\nSo then how did he hadn't manpower convinced corporations can take that next step not just you know replace somebody while they were having surgery or like you said like went on vacation but um you know gee I'm One\nOf your work place or a lot of the people who work you know with you interchangeable you don't have to like make a\nThe meaning of the corporation today\nSo then how did he had had manpower convinced corporations can take that next step not just you know replace somebody while they were having surgery or like you said like went on vacation but on you know gee I\nHave your work place or a lot of the people who work you know with you interchangeable you don't have to like make a full time commitment to them\nWhat happened was the first that there was something called the computer that became really important in the mid Nineteen sixties especially the system three sixty by IBM and corporations were entranced by it they were entranced by this idea of moving all their paper records to destroy records\nOver the past decade northeastern has taken its signature co-op program around the world with opportunities for students on all seven continents you can learn more at northeastern dot edu\nAnd [noise]\nWhy oh why oh why oh why\n[noise]\nMm\nLooking back innovation hub and turn them you know we've been rushing headlong into a technological future\n\nLooking back innovation hub and turn them you know we've been rushing headlong into a technological future I mean I guess you could make the argument we been doing it ever since the industrial revolution started but by the U.S has especially accelerated it seems to me since the late Nineteen seventies or in the early eighties\nThat's author Brian Alexander who I talked to earlier in the show about how much new technologies like automation and robotics has ended jobs and communities especially in places like Ohio where he grew up\nAnd at first it seemed like great promise and there have obviously been many benefits of all this technological change but I think one of the very destructive parts of it has been that it has contributed to this erosion of community\nThat erosion Alexander says it's been particularly powerful in states where factories have substituted robots for people and were solid blue collar jobs now feel scarce but for those who are part of building the technology that drives our lives these sorts of changes have been going on for well ever\nIn the early eighties the job of being a switchboard operator was on its way out\nDaniel Theobald cofounded their bikes company ... and he now serves as their chief innovation officer\nI think in Nineteen eighty four eighty and she had forty thousand switchboard operators today you know a handful at most and nobody really uh that I Know of is really lamenting the loss of the ability to sit behind a desk and plug wires in and out\nGreater was on its way out\nDaniel Theobald cofounded the road bikes company ... and he now serves as their chief innovation officer\nAt Nineteen eighty four eighty and she had forty thousand switchboard operators today you know a handful of most and nobody really uh that I Know of is really lamenting the loss of the ability to sit behind a desk and plug wires in and out of the switchboard all day long it wasn't great work\nBut the other side of the equation is really interesting for me at least and that is if you were to try and handle today's communications\nUsing switchboard operators it would take many many times the population of the entire earth\nTechnologies the about argues change they always have people who made their living constructing horse drawn carriage who made dresses to order who had had shops at a time when men and women thought it was undignified to go out without a hat all those jobs more or less ultimately came to an end you can't turn back time\nYou know we have one point seven seven six trillion dollars of R and D investment globally Seventy five percent of that is outside of the United states [noise] Ninety percent of all the science and scientists and engineers who ever lived are alive today\nFormer deputy assistant secretary of defense for research Melissa flag says that even as America wanted to stop the advance of the sorts of technologies that can lead to fewer workers and car manufacturing plants we couldn't really the economy is to ...\nTime that that were harkening back to doesn't exist\nAnd so the question isn't oh we rushed into it the world has already gone there and in order for us to think about fundamentally improving the lives of the next several generations we have to actually asking them to help us figure out how do you ...\nThe economy is to ...\nThis time that that were harkening back to doesn't exist\nAnd so the question isn't\nOh we rushed into it the world has already gone there and in order for us to think about fundamentally improving the lives of the next several generations\nWe have to actually asking them to help us figure out how do you transform or or build totally new types of communities I Do think we're going to have to accept that\nAs new things are created some things that we remember when the soldier will no longer exists\nFlag is now the northeast regional eat at the U.S army research laboratory\nAnd she and Daniel Theobald who started the robotics company agree that the march of technology offers incredible potential for making our lives better but in the short term they say our responsibility is to pay a lot more attention to people who have been displaced\nYou know when that when the person who's been working a certain type of job almost all of their life feels threatened that the world is going to change because of technology that's the real issue and that's a real hard issue to deal with\nSo ah you know we need to do a better job in this country of taking care of those people have training workers of retraining workers have having continuing education but to to blame the robots um well Timothy is counterproductive because we will end up in a place where we can't take care of the exact people that that we're trying to protect\nDo you feel like I mean you spent I think pretty much your entire adult life making robots\nDoes it feel strange when you hear all this sort of coverage in politics in the media about automation and and you know people feeling really alienated and upset because of sort of what technology in robotics\nThat we're trying to protect do you feel like I mean you spent I think pretty much your entire adult life making robots\nDoes it feel strange when you hear all this sort of coverage in politics in the media about automation and and you know people feeling really alienated and upset because of sort of what technology in robotics doing does it feel weird to be a person who creates robots\nYeah it does you know one thing that is really important for me throughout the throughout that period of building robots as well as we've really been focused on this idea of how do you encourage humanity how do you make life better for people\nThat's got to be the primary focus and I believe very strongly that technology can do that and by and large technology has done that all the way back to the stone age\nI'm Melissa and I know you grow up in Missouri and your family had and actually has now a a cotton farm in Arkansas talk about what you see not in Silicon valley not maybe in Boston or New York uh but they're\nMy hometown Sykes and trucking is the main industry there so there's a lot of conversation that I've had with folks who I Know who live in ... and and their thoughts about listening to conversations about automation\nAnd they're scared and an angry that people talk about it like it's exciting rather than talking about the impact when I go to the farm the flip side is it's allowed small farms to continue to exist and to actually make enough money to be relevant for families\nIn ways that we couldn't have otherwise because having precision grading and no till farming and\nQuite frankly Roundup Ready cotton and things like this that have allowed us to do farming with fewer people right I mean those tractors or\nIt's allowed small farms to continue to exist and to actually make enough money to be relevant for families in ways that we couldn't have otherwise because having precision grading and no till farming and\nQuite frankly Roundup Ready cotton and things like this that have allowed us to do farming with fewer people right I mean those\nTractors are basically robots that have satellite precision you know place the input here and so it's kind of incredible to see both sides of it where it's really enabled individual families to farm in a way that they could never have done and it's increase the yield of this land by\nJust tremendous amounts on the other side right you you see people losing jobs and so I think when you start to have those conversations across communities in the same town it's really exciting because then you start to see these debates between people who really trust each other\nAnd that's an intriguing again it's it's that having the technologist in charge of the conversation is tricky and you learn in DOD because\nEvery single thing that a soldier or an airman or a sailor or marine uses a ship a jet right\nA submarine or these incredible pieces of technology but these are kids that came out of my home town right and we've trained them to be in this universe incredibly high tech\nAnd so there are these incredible translators between hey you know it can enable you and you can use it an amazing ways and you don't have to be a PHD computer scientist to do it\nYou're listening to innovation hub I'm ... I'm Talking with Daniel Theobald co founder and chief innovation officer of vetting that robotics and most of the flag the north east region only eat at the U.S army research lab Daniel\nThere are these incredible translators between hey you know it can enable you and you can use it an amazing ways and you don't have to be a PHD computer scientist to do it\nYou're listening to innovation have I'm ... I'm Talking with Daniel Theobald co founder and chief innovation officer of ... robotics and must have flagged the north east region only eat at the U.S army research lab Danielle\nLet's talk about another strand of this conversation uh which I think probably doesn't get talked a lot about 'em in in most media um because we're very busy having the jobs in technology conversation\nBut I Wonder how much people in technology worry um that the U.S and maybe because of some of these concerns is falling behind in the world in terms of robotics and automation or you know are we doing great and don't worry about it\nYou know because we have a very high standard of living here and because you know where several generations in from significant events in the world like World War two et cetera", "show_name": "The Pulse", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "28"}
