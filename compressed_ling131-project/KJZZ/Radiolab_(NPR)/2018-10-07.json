categorically unequivocally does deny the allegations against we buy\nAnd senators loudly accused the other side of dirty politics\nWhat you want to do is destroyed this guy's life hold this seat open and hope you win at twenty twenty\nNow just weeks before voters head to the polls Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court that became clear when three of the four remaining undecided senators voted to support cabinet of\nMr President I Will so chicken for judge Kavanaugh\nAs the final vote tally became clear protestors warm the cap\nWhat the lasting impact of this on the court on the national mood on the mid term election to talk about all of that we've got congressional reporter Kelsey Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak everybody hey there right\nSo it's pretty clear by the limits of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking\nThat she was going to be supporting Canada and then just a few minutes later Joe mentioned the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cap it on and that brought us to very clearly locked in ...\nWe're going to circle back to ... in

people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nIt did look that way there was a ... a few moments where we were chasing around senators or Tim and I were standing and different hallways different parts of the capital trying to find people like Senator Jeff Flake a Republican of Arizona and counting we mentioned and mansion\nTo see if they were going to stick with their votes um flake with a little bit cryptic we didn't really know what was going to happen and then ... and had lunch\nWith Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and he came out saying that he felt pretty good about things and from there it seems like we were heading in that direction where the fifty one vote for going to quickly come into place\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an answer\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an answer it's just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Asia Rascoe and Tim Mak thanks everybody\nThanks glad to be here Thanks This is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of the week\nUnited States Senate fifty seven people tell her I Need your help we will never dies down by and if we buy [noise]\n\nEvery week we focused on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate red ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go walk us through\nWhat race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where it's Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and serve two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats telling me you know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can yes wise I actually had met her before\nIt's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson is facing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats telling me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carrying yes wise I actually had met her before\nDuring the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump She told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning but his governor for re election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane but\nHe's showing me he's working from Florida he showed me well he'd do\nAn awesome what can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote isn't Florida\nYet still um you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and so some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you're talking about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott you know she broke up very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died\nCritical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude of this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community\nRick Scott you know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria\nAnd after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times so this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate we should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station that was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration\nAnd Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hard line on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill Nelson really just wants to have open borders\nOne of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country\nThat's really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican\nOperative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr you've led and the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift the ...\nAs well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican\nOperative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls or you lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and\nWas yelling at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line right and and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most\nFifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country are at the minute come out to narrow thanks so much You're welcome and ... thank you thank you this is the politics you from NPR we'll be right back\nThanks for joining us for the politics show on kj ... we had

it's a free we're just\nWe're here with a special broadcast through the mid term elections and so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans and suddenly talking about a backlash to all of them the blood\nDrenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man\nWe're fighting now that the if you were a white male it's okay to be against white guys you're out you're\nIt's done that's all I Need to pay for the men and I said this whole show male voters are suddenly\n'cause I think it could easily as well turn out to me the era of the man who feel like the target is on their back on it\nSuddenly talking about a backlash to all of them the blood\nDrenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man\nWe're fighting now that the the the viewer a white male it's okay to be against white guys you're out there\nIt's done that's all I didn't get paid for the man and I said this whole show male voters are suddenly\nEnergize because I think it could easily as well turn out to be the era of the man who feel like the target is on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person who was never meant citizen I just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do mom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey hey there how's it going so Domenico we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nBut certainly she was a very credible witness well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point uptick enthusiasm among Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election it was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that's eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men\nYeah what stood out to me in in that\nPoll was in what's called the\nGeneric ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men now\nRepublicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that's eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men\nYeah what stood out to me in in that poll was in what's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the midterms yeah there was a six point jump among men now there were more likely to vote\nFor Republican than for a Democrat just in the past week yes there is this just in the past week and that is absolutely has everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know they're so much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus following\nThe hearing was on how women reacted um\nWomen on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and they there was a big surge in campaign donations but there was something else happening two men were angry\nTam we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days you just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nNo not only is it not a new thing from President Trump it's not a new thing in American culture and politics so President Trump really ran on some of this grievance and and some of this\nBig moment [laughter] of energy among Republicans and then it goes well or whether this is you know the python is now a bunch of python in anger as ... as a motivating factor is much stronger in the moment than it is among them\nThat's political editor Domenico Montanaro White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks everybody You're welcome\nYou're welcome [noise]\n\nThis is politics you from NPR I'm Scott\nDetrow it seems like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might have missed in to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran good to be with you it's got some of the things we're going to talk about what is in big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh\nSo let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an authorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve he's got a lot of money to run that agency and all the functions but we'll concerts\nOf the things we're gonna talk about what had been big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an authorization\nBill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve he's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum how Britain's giving you a bigger seats in Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat and neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also ah to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... I'm related overdoses\nAnd just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend no would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority\nThey're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment and they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wanted to\nMake this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment and abroad and eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs and also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller okay\nShifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married that's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify\nFor that second base so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them ... and diplomats to the United nations so\nThose people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage in just about any country in the world\nBut in fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that possible\nSo is there a plan for for people who live in a country with that same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nThat NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics show from NPR News I'm ... years ago [noise]\n\nAnd as I said this is the politics shell from NPR we're going to take a quick break and be right back [noise]\nOn Elving catching up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics show from NPR like Iran like years ago [noise]\n\nAnd as I said that his politics you from NPR we're going to take a quick break be right back\nYou're listening to the politics show on K Jay Z thank you so much for joining us today\nWe're just a few minutes away from it milk street radio that's coming up to\nJay Jay Z is your source for Arizona election coverage it continues with a live debate to congressional district to Tuesday night\nAt seven kj these these ... and other panelists will moderate the debate between Democrats and ...

immigration they're bringing drugs [noise] they're bringing crime there rape is\nPresident Trump launched his campaign with a controversial hard line stance on immigration and voters latched on

host ... sat down with NPR's John Burnett and Mara Liasson John covers immigration is based in Texas ... one of our national political correspondents hello to you\nBoth Hi there Hi President Trump began his administration with you know what somebody just kind of get pretty mean spirited policy of the travel ban it was one of the first things he did in office and even more recently December there with his and he should have a family separation this was a huge low point for the Trump Administration\nIn part because they had to roll back a policy that they said was not a policy and many people were incredibly upset even people within his own party he\nWas a summary of where the policy itself stands at this point\nYes there's still several hundred kids that are in us custody and new shelters around the country and health and Human Services which is responsible for ...\nFor finding a foster homes for them and sponsors has said it's taking us a long time we have to do all these criminal background checks we have to fingerprint everybody in the household not just the family member who wants to take the child back but the larger question is did this achieve its\nGoals the goal was to act as a deterrent I'm really to shock potential immigrants into not coming to the U.S and I had an interview with the chief of staff John Kelly a last may and he said that explicitly to me\nA big name of the game is deterrence if if their family separation stands as a pretty\nTough ... could be a tough deterrent a would be a tough deterrent um a a much faster turnaround on asylum even though people say that's cruel and heartless to take a mother away from her children yeah I think a cruel and heartless or I wouldn't put it quite that\nJohn Kelly a last may and he said that explicitly to me\nA big name of the game is deterrence if if their family separation stands as a pretty\nTough ... could be a tough deterrent a would be a tough deterrent um a a much faster turnaround on asylum even though people say that's cruel and heartless to take a mother away from her children yeah I think a cruel and heartless or I wouldn't put it quite that way the children will be taken care of\nAnd so obviously the numbers that are referred to earlier about the jump in the family units and unaccompanied kids crossing the border over the summer the shows that it didn't have a deterrent effect\nSo my sense of how this may and all affect the midterms you know they make up of Congress because this issue again is one that I Would argue and an out talking to voters and his somewhat again faded from the consciousness\nIf the debate is about border security Republicans win in other words if you're talking about abolishing ice which sounds like dismantling our border security system than Republicans when if you're focusing on separating kids from their parents Democrats win\nBut family separation is over now and overnight right and so the of the president's onto the executive order 'em and so I hear it down in Texas all away from the attorney general's race to congressional races to the the big Senate race um they use family separation as shorthand\nFor you know look at the atrocities committed by this administration I just don't know how much traction they're getting with that um but it's a it's an wide circulation\nTraction they're getting without um but it's a it's been wide circulation", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Phoenix", "day": "07"}
