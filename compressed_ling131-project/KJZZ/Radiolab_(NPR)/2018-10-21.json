who can afford you know about the candidates\nWere here with a special broadcast through the mid term elections to keep you up to date on the major themes and rate I think you understand that but the stakes could not be a higher for this country typically the president's party loses seats in mid term elections but nothing in politics is typical anymore\nDo you go out and you need to vote Republican\nRepublicans have one of the most favorable Senate map any party has seen in years but Democrats fighting to hold on to ... in states Trump won so I don't think there's going to be a blue

have one of the most favorable Senate map any party has seen in years Democrats fighting to hold on to ... in states Trump won so I don't think there's going to be a blue where am I\nHope is written word for it time Democrats seem to have momentum center cruise not going to be honest with you with congresswoman or leading the way two years of a partisan circus now\nWith only a little over two weeks to go to election day the races are tightening\nI Believe Arizona's deserve a senator who just cause the balls and strikes and you have a choice somebody wore the uniform\nFor someone who protested our troops\nWe want to get a reality check on where things stand so we're going to take a deep dive on some key Senate races\nTo talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR's Dominican much in our own Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow hey everyone pay us much either the narrative has changed so many times his election cycle or are we just seeing a normal tightening\nIt was like early September just after the summer when everyone started to tipping where people were starting to look at Arizona Tennessee Texas all my goodness everyone wants to talk about the Texas senator yeah this is the right to do right well you know some of that has fallen back to political gravity and political reality\nYou know a lot of people will pay get to the cabinet or confirmation battle and the fact that Republican enthusiasm spiked\nBut a lot of this is just natural tightening and in states like Tennessee and Texas there just happen to be more Republicans\nThere we started the cycle with Republicans very hopeful that they could pick up three four five seats because the Senate battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular and to me what's been the interesting thing about this cycle\nIn fact the Republican enthusiasm spiked but a lot of this is just natural\nTightening and in states like Tennessee and Texas they're just happened to be more Republicans\nThere we started this cycle with Republicans very hopeful that they could pick up three four five seats because the Senate battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular\nAnd to me what's been the interesting thing about this cycle is that those dreams have gone away that yes there was that blip of democratic hopefulness in the fall that oh maybe they could pick up a couple and hold their own everywhere and maybe even the perennial pipe dream of Texas\nCame up again but now we're back to where we were and Republicans are doing worse I think in the Senate battleground than they should be given the map and given the great economy that they've got\nWe've entered that final few weeks of an election that's kind of the dark side of the moon where there's not many from data points but suddenly you see wild shift in how a political observers view things\n[noise]\nThis is a politics show from NPR I must my Holland it feels like every week there is one major news story that dominates the headlines and because of that other important stories I can get overlooked\nWe dive into one story this week they did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us from around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he\nLeft his job this week as White House counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise and why it matters that he left\nThe bare bones of these years already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House down again is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney ... Loni or who is well known in Republican legal circles but while simple don't he is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay an Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill\nKnown in Republican legal circles but while Siblani is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay and and in flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of this field Harry inside already to me right in terms of who's who and who they all watch for and and it sounds sort of like we're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in a pretty high powered job that\nThat maybe doesn't resonate for most folks and is that a fair\nAssessment it is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be heard and when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges in the trial court an appeals court levels over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nThat take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller and McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nIndeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation into you\nThe court levels all over the country and a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nIt take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name that Robert Mueller and McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible uh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign\nAll that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of the twenty sixteen Trump campaign or does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood he has been handling much um the mole or matter and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative\nArrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nAnd do you want to ask you though about the job itself did together again represent the White House the the institution of the presidency or did he represented that Donald Trump the man the president himself\nSays the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that ambiguity which has really been with us for a very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity be speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution and the tradition of the office or to the humans who have held the office where it is one in the other began\nCreated this office

H. Y. Y. Joe thanks for joining us great to be here you mean you could start with you can you know it's just a lay of the land start with the basics of who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare in one support from House Republican\nThanks for joining us great to be here you mean you could start with you can you know sister ran veranda start with the basics if who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare and won support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that he is running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on the national Security Council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district you talk a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money funneling into the district and became took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it was a little bit more detail about who lived in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out\nThat way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly\nThen yanked to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out that way so\nIt's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty six team\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter dust I mean given her talk to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nWell when you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort and this amendment that he put forward and the contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave here this is the kind of see that goes\nIn general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about healthcare\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it's kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment\nTo the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really what had changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would've allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law and Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions\nThat really what had changed the current health care structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip\nFrom twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it in their favor\nAs the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those work ... and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nAre aligned that we might not have heard say four years ago it's amazing to see Republicans on their back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place that NPR medical ... thank you so much You're welcome and thank you Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY you got it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nIs the
