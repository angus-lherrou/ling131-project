obviously these are the girl guys talking right right right but you could look at it both\nWays let's get into cruel and just a moment but first of all it's half the fish oil guys on the shoulder because you know you could say that the fish oil is better and stronger but we're talking about the concentrated high omega three fish oil here because it's higher\nThan the omega threes the E. P. A. N. D. H. here that are so important\nFor the heart the brain the memory mood your eyes you scan your hair your nails so in one sense you could say well the fish oils better but\nIn another sense I have to hand it to the crew guys because in terms of antioxidant power crude oil is extraordinary and it's because there's a molecule and crew oil it's naturally occurring called actors Hampton and actors Athens Steve this is one of the most powerful\nAntioxidants we've ever discovered Steve by one measure of antioxidant activity at six thousand times stronger\nThan vitamin C. while amazing band the opposite in\nPower in the cruel and now as we're getting older fifty plus or is like myself I'm fifty two and\nWe don't make as many antioxidants naturally are antioxidants systems are kind of slowing down and at the same time we're producing more free radicals naturally this is what we call it cruel omega fifty plus extra antioxidant power\nAnd extra Crowell remember five hundred milligrams of crow instead of three hundred and sixty seven percent more plus\nThe vitamin D so important for us and this is just incredible value proposition I of folks that were going out and they were getting

this sounds pretty important I'm going to give this go it's only going to cost me six Ninety five and they get it and they try it out and what they start to see because it doesn't take long remember the joint study seven days\nTwenty percent more comfortable but they start to seize hey I'm more comfortable I feel better they noticed their energy is better and they realize hey you know what this is important and they tell their friends and they tell their relatives and they tell their loved ones and purity has been doing business this way for I don't know Twenty years now\nLet's look at one more you know this is a great it's the Modi will buy Gracie five out of five star she writes it works\nI feel a difference in my choice after only one we also have the nicest staff\nThat's what that ... the of the nation staff people are going to appreciate work\nAnd it's probably the single greatest concern that people face as they age so anything that we can do to boost heart health becomes really a top priority you know this I Know this and those folks out there and others as well and I know you mentioned earlier that omega threes literally lower our risk of coronary heart disease you I have that correct 'cause that's the same as\nYou know absolutely and and protecting the Hart says what put omega threes on the map back in the seventies Dr ... discovered you know how protective they were for the Eskimos by the way is a wonderful guy had\nLunch with them a year or two ago great conversation but bottom line is omega threes prepared to heart in so many ways they promote a smooth rhythm uncle heartbeat important for the bodies normal inflammatory response in the heart muscle inside the arteries in jeans\nThey promote those youthful flexible arteries so important for circulation they promote healthy blood platelets activity help your red blood cell activity who support healthy blood pressure that's very important\nTriglycerides so they do so much for the heart so simply amazing cardiovascular protection with these omega threes\nAnd it just keeps getting better then that's it you know I got I got a reminder when\nPeople I have patients coming here all the time and I'm like\nAre you taking your omega threes I Hope you're still taking your omega threes you know they're afraid to say you know\nLike the omega three doctors take your omega threes interact if there was only one nutrient that I could take Steve honest to God if there was only one nutrient that I could take hands down to make it through the first most important nutrient ... and this girl I make a fifty plus the love the way to combine the ... with the official she even the best of both worlds can't beat it\nOne of my favorite gas is on the line we've got Chris kill him also noticed the medicine hunter Sandy by now CNN polls Chris the Indiana Jones of natural medicine because he's constantly scouring the globe searching for natural remedies\nYou may have seen Chris on the doctor on a show or\nMaybe on PBS or CBS and also on Fox News where he does a health segment he's been featured in New York Times and also on ABC's twenty twenty anti Christ is joining us today to discuss not one but three of the hottest nutritional ingredients out there on the market today even better he's teamed up with purity today\nTo give away complimentary bottle to everyone out there in the listening audience so do not I repeat do not change that dial\nFirst a quick introduction curriculum is an author and an educator he's written fourteen books he's conducted research over thirty countries again he's been on with Oprah and friends and Dr oz Chris welcome back to the show\nThank you so much pat it's always a pleasure to have a great conversation with you\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly it can be daunting\nYou know with all the different supplements out there not Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this besides a good multi vitamin and some fish oil maybe a few other things going into the three super hot nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nHappy to do that pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called ... apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigated they use in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor Rick I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza ... I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agents that everybody can benefit from a very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human different spiritual why did you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other worst you quote a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all in separate products they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing I Know when he shouldn't have been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging\nBut what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and is July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood unify on you recap\nSome of these headlines of chill me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume that don't actually\nWind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants\nOur bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue to ... so you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to ... so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nRight let's switch gears and talk about this human which is number\nTwo on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula really offering free brought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human what'd you smelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most powerful\nSuper feeds on the planet you can positively influence our D. N. A. maintain joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this and we talked about the software and few minutes ago just patented B. C. M. Ninety\nFive formula of Kirk human which seven times greater absorption\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know the term Kirk human\nThey may well no ... group which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying tumor Rick and its derivative ... since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied as there's\nA couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined health so if people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we call\nCardio protective it helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and\nOne last thing that is really kind of astounding is that ... actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these agents in the brain that protect the actual issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we talked about the green tea in the current human in your new green she she are liquid soft your formula which purity is giving away for free today but first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk ritual which is super hot right now there was no some of the headlines and the science behind re spiritual I Know it's from red wine and the French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just said to shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes that also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like\nGreen tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and insulin", "show_name": "Mr. Mechanic", "month": "10", "state": "NE", "day": "13", "station": "KFAB", "city": "Omaha"}
