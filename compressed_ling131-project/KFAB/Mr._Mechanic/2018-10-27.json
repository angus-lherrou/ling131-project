and he says this molecule abuse happens to be concentrated in our skin\nHair eyes and joins he says this substance not only dramatically influences are appearance in other words how young are how healthy we look but more importantly our physical strength are flexibility and mobility\nThis is our ability to do things ... things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance and how new breakthroughs are allowing us to get it back and keep it\nAs we get older [noise] All right here's our gas to health a journalist the bills Saudi is here bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about\n... acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan where people maintain high levels of ha and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with your pet and all your statements to enter\nBoost the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic acid supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support in particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offer today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offers from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule on the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies\nWe have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. A. it it makes the well is babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH H joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically used pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nIf you're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... about ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator in the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule AJ\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells\nThat connect all of everything that we have begins to lose its water it separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting to wrinkle we shrivel up\nWe lose an inch in our height we we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know parts of daily on was looking\nFor a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles the thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue costs ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about highly run a gas it well it took Thirteen Years for all the costs of me it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are going to take this to the doctors and pointed out\nAs they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts with patients in people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these useful levels of ha restored in their body\nNow do your Britain a great deal about the role of highly want a gas it in the bodies connective tissue how does each a work in the joints and the connective tissue\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surrounded the nerves
