um [noise] oh my goodness\nI uh\nI don't think she was paid off I think that what she's trying to do is maybe run a third rail like an independent maybe and maybe at one point of Democrats ended up

I mean it's like a ... real horror story and\nIt came to light after one woman a there was a a woman who lost her life in a clinic and wet nay or because they had first responders that couldn't get to her because the doors were barred and and they had stuff in front of on and then they go in there and they find\nNot only is everything discussing Les dirty but there's actually like no doctors there and they just have a teenager girls running the place then he had a collection of aborted fetuses and ... and he was doing some super\nSuper illegal super late term stuff\nIt was horrified I ... and then when the grand jury when they when\nThey had the people who were testifying before the grand jury and I was reading their testimonies I couldn't even get there is some of them\nI and it was so heavy and so I have a lot of respect for the people who came together to put together this movie that is coming out on October twelve guys now the trial of America's biggest serial killer because they were working from actual fact from what was happening\nIn this case and it's horrifying enough just a glimpse of that you get of it but you know they had\nTo really roll up their sleeves and get into it and I God love him for joining me right now is international film and TV star Peabody Award winner Nick ... who directed this really horrifying film neck welcome to the show\nAnd thank you so much for getting my introduction right now so many people see\nThe you know not everybody is as good as we are we we really take care of our people here that is how we how it works by the way congratulations on this film out a really fantastic cast of media dean king Janine Turner ... and obviously you\nUh directing at this how hard was this for you to do because I Know everybody I think most everybody you know we caught him up and most everybody remembers this awful horror this horrifying story\nHow difficult was this for you to to tackle as a director because this is some really heavy stuff\nYou know um when we started working on the script or we all kind of agreed that what we needed to do was just tell the truth about this and not try to surmise about it at all because they just the facts of the case or so horrific Internet cells that we didn't really need to offer our opinion about it\nSo that's really how we approach it we approached it just like we were telling the truth crunch story and just and it's interesting it's a killer happened to be an abortion doctor who was killing babies after they were born and it was it's very grand subject matter that the movie itself\nIt costs about the ... are catching him and convicting him it's strangely uplifting in a way it's not and gory and it's not disgusting it's actually we've been doing test screenings and people people really love the mood\nAnd that's a lot of talent to be able to ... to ... to ... to do that and and I know that\nYou know reading some of the testimonies and I know that this is you know you showcased this aspect of it in the film of some of these women who you know they had never been pushed to speak out about what was it about this stuff until some of the more horrific things happen and they were really brave and and that they were speaking up and just the abuses that this guy\nIn this in his clinic I mean it's horrifying and I love how you said the facts are bad enough\nThat they can speak for themselves I mean that there isn't there really isn't any room for pontificate in this film because he is such a his evil is such a presence in this film on how to talk to me a little bit too 'cause I Know this was it was a labor of love for everybody who was involved and it took awhile for this film to come together [noise]\nUm what what did you find to be the most challenging aspect\nOf putting a real life story about a topic that is normally not accurately portrayed and not honestly discussed by Hollywood and pop culture what was the biggest challenges you ran across you know an interesting in into bringing us to live [noise]\nWell the most challenging aspect of it really was a way to present the story that that it would it would still be accessible to a wide audience I mean\nWe came out of the movie with a PG Thirteen waiting which is run yeah to get all along and and the way that we did that was by\nNot only sticking to the facts as as much as we could put them together course you have to rearrange some things and you have to combine some characters in order to make the movie but there's not as much of the truth of what happened in the courtroom and what happened in the investigation is in the film\nJust stays truthfully as we could make it\nAnd uh you know the challenge of uh making sure that you you told people about the uh the really horrific details and you didn't rub it in their face you didn't shock them with the actual gory\nA visual images to and I think we accomplish that you know quite well everybody that she's in movies\nYou know we've been doing a lot of testing is like I said and they always talk at movie grateful that we don't run these images in their face and just let the horror of what his men did play in the theater of right\nI Know in the beginning of this um and and and everyone we're talking with next year see him you know from from justified and uh so many other so many other films and and now his new film that he's directing guys now I had read\nUm this is some time ago how initially um the film ... this this film was blocked by the trial judge because he didn't like\nHow he was portrayed he had been called like one of the most corrupt ah his hit the hit Philadelphia was one of the most corrupt governments and he was mad about that he was mad about his portrayal and are you at the apparently got through that\n[noise] well actually he you know he hadn't seen the film he was he was really talking about the book and just assuming that whatever characterizations he didn't like in the book was in the film and in the film I mean it's not for trade as the bad guy at all just sort of has to stay in their overruled [laughter]\nPretty rural right\nWe don't we don't really go after the judge and the movie at all so I think they must have cleared up the misunderstanding because that all the way so\nThat's that that's awesome you have dean Canaan assume he's a he's a detective who's running this down and
