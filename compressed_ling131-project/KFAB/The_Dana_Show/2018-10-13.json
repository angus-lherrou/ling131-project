say you and the economic relationship you kill the entire uh arms deal but I think you you you draw a line and and you put some kind of sanction on the Saudis\nPresident Trump says he doesn't want to

appointments wasn't that didn't you hear that by the way with\nWith um Kavanaugh some lifetime appointment\nOkay ... thanks guys [noise] is there a scene of a fifth teen of them now as we switch over to\nSaudi Arabia because this story is really this is really insane\nUh and I I see this really awful media spin on this to a which is unfortunate but you know uh the situation with this is that a reporter who uh\nWas he had been critical previously of the new roller the new leadership and Saudi Arabia and had\nWritten a a ... a bunch of uh Jamal a cast Augie\nHad written things about the crown prince the Saudi crown prince and he was a legal resident of the United states have lived in both assemble and in London and so he was in Turkey and he was apparently visiting the Saudi uh\nThe uh embassy or they're constantly there he was visiting the consulate in in ... is symbol and then he just liked disappeared\nOff base of the earth day just disappear and Turkish authorities say well he was\nMurdered and they said they had recordings proving that he was murdered and there were some pretty gruesome rumors going around about how and they were blaming some Saudis that had entered turkey\nNot long before a democracy soggy disappeared and then they left and they think you know the Saudis say no it's not us we didn't do it so it's kind of going back and forth and\nSo this is the ... because this now could affect two different alliances actually three different alliances the U.S Saudi Arabian alliance the Turkish Saudi Arabia alliance and the United states in Turkish alliance\nWhich you know I don't I have my complaints about art on particularly when he beat protestors so but the the fact that this guy was\nA legal resident of the United states changes things\nAnd he apparently like the only thing that he did that would have invoked the Saudi crown princes rat\nIs to have written about him in a negative light and so to Turkish officials said this is why he disappeared [noise] and so there you go so you have there are some senators that want 'em\nAn investigation and in fact we have some audio here because had an hour it was was asked about this\nDuring a a press conference and they don't really know a whole lot more than what you were reading in the press apparently and it's you know do you believe the Saudis do you believe turkey um and this is Heather Nauert was is the state department spokesman on this uh this is when she was asked about it\n[noise] twenty Seventeen\nEarlier this week or the vice president has talked about that the president has talked about this we're all concerned about his whereabouts we don't have any information on his whereabouts right now for\nWhat happened to him as you can see anytime you turn on the news you open the newspaper there is a lot of speculation and there are a ton of rumors out there we're making determinations and watching the fur facts we don't have the facts yet\nAnd so we're going to hold back on her comments until we have concrete\nInformation that the U.S government can share\nWell which is and that's true so now there are some senators and it's a bipartisan group they want the Saudis sanctioned and because they believe that they are complicit in his disappearance Rand Paul wants to stop arms sales and military assistance to Saudi Arabia\nUm and in fact over at Brookings they noted that the royal Saudi air force is entirely dependent upon on American and British support for air fleet of fifteens Apache isn't tornado aircraft pieces of either Washington or London halted the flow of logistics the the royal start Saturday air force it'd be grounded\nAnd then\nYou also have to take into consideration how Iran would benefit from this because it hasn't\nBeen one of the things and I think this is a really good point to make 'em that that Matthew Continetti over it Free Beacon noted and I hadn't thought about this previously but it said look what Iran it you know they haven't really been brought up in relation to trauma demonic has a hobby but it's a factor\nBecause they are pressing up against the Saudis on multiple front they fostered sheer rebellion with the kingdom itself and in Bahrain\nThey've armed into bed at who the who have been going back and forth with the Saudis are and they're its proxies actually are on the cusp of victory in Syria basically control in Lebanon and they've shown chaos in Iraq\nIran's European allies are attempting to create a financial lifeline that would provide relief from us sanctions\nAnd Saudi Arabia has been the lynchpin of America's Middle East strategy for close to a century\nBut that relationship has not been without cost Continetti note what would it cost via the alliance fractured the Saudis would be imperiled in Yemen potentially endangering the free flow of traffic and the Gulf of Aden Iranian victory would extend Shia crescent to the south\nAnd the company the one running through Iraq and Syria and Lebanon\nSo\nTrump said that Saudi Arabia with my two weeks without American Sport\n\nAnd it says it and and Continetti no to the middle east and live on our already filled with examples of state failure is America prepared to risk another study meltdown would deprive the United states of a counter terror ally it would royal energy markets and create pockets of instability and which do hottest an Iranian backed militias thrive\nAnd it would also make of that for Israel to show they said to forestall such a disaster the Saudis like others before the my turn to Russia or China for support\nThat then would accelerate the waning of American influence in the middle east and boost the very autocracies we condemn\n[noise] so\nYou have to weigh evidence and consider how you would punish them if it turns out they acted like Russia or China or North Korea or Syria or Iraq or Iran this is it's not as cut and dry\nThe new one but nuances debt so for a lot of people black or
