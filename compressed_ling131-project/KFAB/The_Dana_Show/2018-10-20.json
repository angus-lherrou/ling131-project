impeaching Trump and you remember when the 'cause even before he started his you know the Senate campaign he had said that he would vote to impeach Trump and then at the last debate he said he would impeach Trump\nSo after he said he would work with him well now he was trying to go for he he wouldn't answer the question actually right away listen to this because he was asked about this again listen\nYou've already said even though that's not done that you would vote to impeach and so according to the constitution that means that the president has committed the crime of trees in primary

pressed and kept moving ... kept pushing forward on it uh that's\nDana Bash so to her credit she was you know she caught him she was like well ... no he didn't actually heads of the questions even reminded him she goes congressman uh the question was about impeachment and you said in July the what is a member of the house right now though to impeach if you changed your\nMind and that's when he kept going on and then he because he talked about he talked about Russia he talked about everything but the actually answering the questions and then finally goes well but yeah it is to answer your question I Do think there's enough there for impeachment\nAnd in fact I Would vote on it what do you mean enough there so he would he is he's but he said he was\nNeutral on a vote to remove but he would vote to impeach\nWhat is that even mean cause he actually said that\nWell I don't even know if he's not going to be removed yeah that was the whole point\nUh you can't\nThere's hardly any of this works I'm Glad that that uh Dana Bash pin him down on us that was good uh because that he just was all over the place with his answers I mean he just he's not a good candidate he's just simply

much for joining us\nIt's great to be with you there thanks for having me\nIt give us some perspective on this because I you know I I find it hard to believe that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia would decide to because he had hurt feelings over something that\nA ... show that you wrote about in his columns that he would carry out an assassination in broad daylight ah where his people and his inner circle would be caught on closed circuit TV entering the consulate\nAnd uh just over over the college I mean there seems to be a lot more here I'm ... is is that an accurate way to kind of situation\nAlthough certainly a lot more there and it is is just baffling to me to see the gyrations that the left media the legacy media is doing in this story which is all of a sudden they've taken a guy\nWho you know under any other planets or would be surprised even at a resident visa ear and out of the Washington Post as line I think him and making them into a hero and ...\nHaven't really looked at his writings and we'll get to that in a second but far as the Saudis are concerned they're ... they're they're Middle East dictatorship and and yet the President Trump was left with the\nObama disaster that had been so one sided to the Iranians that he's trying to resurrect sort of the twentieth century\nModel of foreign policy which was a balance between Sunni and Shia so at the end of the day us are becoming unhinged about what happened to Mr ... is going to end up benefiting the Iranians the Qataris and the Turks now that doesn't mean that an ally has free will to assassinate a\nA columnist and activists are but we should not be\nA glossy glassy eyed on exactly what this guy was all about and what was the about well I'll remind you of three or four months ago the Saudis put into sort of a detention and the Ritz Carlton and all of the the royal family that was involved with the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo they took basically a trillion dollars that had been used globally for the last fifty years where the Saudis had been funding Muslim Brotherhood operations around the planet\nThe last six months they put a stop to that part of the leader of that was allowed in will lead\nWho owns a center at Georgetown has owned a uh a center at Harvard et cetera which has been radicalized and Muslims in the west or one of the close friends that will lead is ...\n... came to America a year ago there's no doubt that the princes folks want it to bring the show again for interrogation and another thing so odds are that went sour odds are like many other dictatorships on my only knows the Syrian one pretty well\nThey're pretty ruthless thugs and they may have just gone south but the bottom line is is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American very anti Israel\nThe Saudis shifted than the last six months decided to become more pro Israel isn't real reforms it's more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million was starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and they probably wanted to contain him\nWell that and the and that would make sense of the New York times had a pizza I just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership and the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post that it was conservatives that we're conducting a whisper campaign because I looked at the New York times piece and they said you know ... friends were even saying that\nWhenever they would talk with him he very much expressed Arab anti western sentiments and he was a very much into political Islam and he was very much more extreme than some of what was being promoted in the charm offensive\nBy the Saudi crown prince and you just touched on on doctors Yasser you just touched on\nA one of the other point I was going to ask you was whether or not that charm offensive\nAnd and all of this reform that we hear being discussed with the Saudi royal family and with Saudi leadership and policy if it was real reform or if it was more just sort of um a way to to survive politically and you answer that for me\nYeah I mean NBS is no more real reform or the ... is according to the Washington Post contrary to what the Washington Post said two months ago ... show he was writing about how the caliphate is real the Muslim Brotherhood should be a given time to evolve and the bottom line it's\nA majority of critic of approach to the ... if you will and that's not a liberal democracy and\nI have to tell you I did my pod cast a that'll air this weekend on the show gay\nA reform this is the name of it and I basically talk about how much this service and how much it breaks my heart\nThat they are lying I think a gentleman who yes we should speak out our allies should not be taking a abusing or violating human rights of people that are American residence or alone and I said what the Saudis should do if they really want the ... for what they did to this man\nReleased rape better we relieve release ... the attorney that has been in jail for defending raped but we we have called for the release of tons of prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia or secularists\nWho are Christians who are other minorities that have been abused and nobody cared until somebody who was in the inner circles of the Islamic lobby in Washington or got assassinated\nAnd now all of a sudden they care what the Yemeni who were being massacred by the Saudis now all of a sudden the elites in Washington care about the human rights abuses of the Saudis went for eight years we couldn't get Obama dimension once the name of a dissident in Saudi Arabia that we've been working to help\nSo this
