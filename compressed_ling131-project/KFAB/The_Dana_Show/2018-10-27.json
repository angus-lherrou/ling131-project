Danish show let's go to mark and Florida mark you're on the Danish she'll go ahead mark\nHey how you doing this afternoon there are several things that I'd like to talk about uh or at least of all I'm I'm very glad that they caused this person\nA and I believe it's the very beginning of the investigation I don't think it's over yet but my main comment is the rhetoric\nThat has been going on primarily from the left since they lost a into the trade but I've been in for the last thirty eight years one of the things that you do as you look for a root cause in failures and I truly believe that\nThere's been several contributory factors in terms of first of all Saudi ... expectation you had a whole segment a very large segment of the U.S population\nWas told by the media and Bob polls and everything that they've already said that Hillary Clinton was going to win Hillary Clinton was going to win and Hillary Clinton's going to win and all of a sudden guess what she\nDidn't win and the expectation from that that group they just couldn't take it some of those people I Believe and\nWe're taught to lose they never knew how to handle losing ... and because of that because they were so wrong they couldn't handle that it becomes exponentially when you go and look at the media the liberal media because they were wrong\nHow do they say face they're on television they're on radio they are broadcast the everyday yet they were wrong so where do they do they\nBash and they continuously bash if CNN was prohibited from speaking are saying the word Trump will one day put on their spring or on their sprayed it has nothing to talk about\nI think that pat last dog has taken place here it's been conditioning of the population and you keep hearing it keep hearing it where leaders political leaders will political leaders older when they go low we kick them Hillary you can't be civil war with them\nMe if I was in high school I take him out back when I was leaders are talking to their base to their group who lost you can't understand while they lost then fire which of course and I'm not going to do that it's the wrong thing to do you should never get into a fight because of politics you should argue those things out like you're supposed\nTo do so those are my comments where today and I think that the public\nNeeds to relax a little bit uh just like you can't fix stupid you can't change crazy\nAnd that's what we're gonna have to deal with\nAll right mark um gosh I I I I have so many places I Want to go with all of your comments in in all of\nThose who do you and he brought up Maxine you brought up Hillary and he and he brought up\nA gosh what was that was that holder or that you also brought up um that doesn't justify and that's not a rational you you can't don't bring up those points they will it's their phones\nTheir fault this guy was just reacting and and then say at the same time we all know he was wrong but there are instigating it no no we make fun of them for doing stuff like that that stuff when they made those comments that that should have been goal to everybody who disagreed with\nWhat we're doing\nLet's keep on doing what they're doing because this is how they react they don't want us to eat a meal and peace ring it get your cell phone start recording they want to kick us when they're do bring your cell phone start recording don't go sending packages to people that's not making fun of\nThat's [noise] that's violence with violence so\nYou know you're doing something right when somebody else resorts to this\n\nAnd right and wrong shouldn't be divided into liberal or progressive\nIt's wrong to call somebody and to call up and say that somebody should be harassed every time they go out and it's also wrong\nSome threatening packages it's just wrong it's just wrong that's all wrong don't tell me I got to stop doing what I got to do or don't tell anybody else they have to slow down they have to watch the words that come
