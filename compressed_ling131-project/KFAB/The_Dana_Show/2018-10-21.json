lynching because I don't think Democrats want to Lynch black people just like I don't think\nThat the Democrats who previously said Republicans wanna Lynch white people I don't think Republicans are white people I don't think Republicans won a landslide people I just think we could probably make a point with all engines\nAside from that everything that they're staying in it is literally things that I have conversations I have had an every woman I Know has had\nAll of my female friends particularly the moms are boys we have all had these conversations with each other all of the tap and\nWhen they say that you know a girl could uh you know why or and I shared with your story after story after story of this or where you have the presumption of guilt as opposed to innocence these are huge

a problem that the left has when they talk about skin color to like it's not\nWe all know that that's not it right the it's someone's character that makes them who they are has nothing to do with their skin color show I think you're right they diluted the really important message which actually there's a lot of important information and messaging in that\nCommercial I think that was important but when they talk about the white Dems lynching or white girl calling rape or whatever [noise] it loses it loses me you know what I mean that must have just lost on me completely and\nI was

I'm like oh\nYou're going to care about their husbands their sons their their reimpose the care about those pretty yeah I get that but then when you went right into that left the tactic of saying it say um you know what I mean that's what it it's a lefty tactic that turns people off and we saw it in twenty six and\n... and people need to realize that didn't work for them just as you said it did it work for Democrats in twenty sixteen so why would we use it ... why would anybody on the right use it\nYou know like you said it takes the focus of what really is the solid messaging other spot and just focuses on the frivolous empty left you tactic\nYeah that was that was in ...

F. A. B. on my heart radio\n[noise]\nAdvice\nOn Twitter intentional didn't lash on Facebook so the president has said that look this caravan of migrants that flooding through a bunch of different countries I guess preparing for some sort of stand off at the U.S border where people a plan to apply for asylum on the president said look\nIt tweeted and said we strongly and formed a president of Honduras and if that large carbon and people hadn't to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or a will be given to Honduras effective immediately\nWell now we hear that Mexico is moving to stop the migrant caravan and the outgoing Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto\nUm they have a new trade deal with the United states and so obviously I think he's looking to score some point then it looks like they're trying to do whatever they can to stop and joining us right now on this issue\nIs our good representative from the beautiful Republican Texas congressman Louie Gohmert who uh of course obviously has been watching that says that they're going to be coming up to the do all this southern Texas border congressmen good to have you as always\nAlways good to talk to your data you bet well it's been interesting as yet and thank God that Trump is the president literally thank you know I get tired of\nPeople calling us names haters and all these things because we want to do what will be best not only for America even if you don't care about the Seventy thousand\nAmericans that died from a drugs mostly from Mexico or if you cared about the Mexican people and the people in Central America you would say yeah\nLet's stop a secure the border\nLet's don't encourage these kind of caravans there been projections maybe one in four or more a girls that come up your right along the way there are people that\nDie every time that there is this big assault and I think our department of justice and are in jail or\nBe looking at whether or not there were any Americans that were helping plunging helping with finding on this assault on our sovereignty\nBut they were from Mexico is secure the border build a wall where we need it and so it cuts off that eighty billion project ... gone from the U.S in the Mexico drug cartels for drugs\nThey're projections that may be\nThat much or more was made off human trafficking insects trapped by the drug cartels but you've got those tens of billions or maybe hundreds of billions of dollars off\nThat's going to drug cartels and the corruption slow store crawl and Mexico becomes one of the doubt Gen economies in the world and brings El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras\nAlong with it but a Trump is taking a strong stance and I'm so grateful years\nIt despite what the haters the ... the ... after mainstream whatever one called media whatever they say it's still the most compassionate thing we can do is not continue to encourage what Obama did people get hurt doing that and killed\nYeah now that's that's for sure the uh one of the the the guy I guess who is one of the other or one of the organizers of this had been detained by Guatemalan police officers they said he wouldn't comply with Guatemalan immigration role so\nThey arrested him and deported him back to Honduras are we seeing more cooperation as a result of Trump's saying look will will will end a weren't will close the\nWill close the border are are are they now it seems like they're they've been incentivized to to maybe perhaps cooperate a little bit more\nWell yeah you're exactly right that is what's happening\nAnd they also know this is not that Obama this is a man that will do what he says and so uh they know we Syria say no serious when he says\nThe workout drank diluted and put tariffs on or where and when he says look we'll put the military on the border if necessary and I and I talked with the then candidate Donald Trump two years ago about this uh and and the fact that actually\nWoodrow Wilson one of my least favorite presidents he actually did one thing and right after\nSome punch over his day came across into the United states and killed a bunch of families are age that general Pershing down or they get they put military in this new thing go national\nGuard a and I\nAsked the the ... a political nonpartisan congressional Research Service for report on that and they said we can't say for sure but in essence a probably Seventy five thousand ... ...\nAs military National Guard were put on our border I could have been as many as a hundred and fifty thousand and then pushing led some actually\nInto Mexico chasing the bad guys but you know what when he put the military on the border nobody nobody Jamie and we did not want to come in and uh you\nKnow they this president knows that and he's willing to do what's necessary to not only protect America but it protects others who might be tempted to take a caravan and\nLose their lives are being raped or be subjected to sex trafficking human trafficking uh it's it's the best\nThing we can do for both sides of the border it really is and thank goodness Trump is going to do that\nYeah I definitely and I mean I wouldn't I think they're going to have the same problem even if they may get than they do end up making it all the way to Mexico because from what I understand Mexico told them well if you're I mean you can't just enter legally you can apply for asylum well then they're going to have the same problem that we would have\nAnd I would think that they would want that word before these people got their border\nWell and and actually\nMexico in the past ah with Obama a they would let people like that come through knowing that when they ... they say you jump through Mexico as long as you don't stop here so in other words they just wouldn't enforce Mexican law\nAnd okay you can pass through just you know make sure you go at it in the United states but they knew the law that if they come into the United states from Central America come through Mexico and then get into the United states\nYou don't they don't have and it's a legitimate asylum claim because your right hand and I\nCome to the states from Honduras or El Salvador or\nWild wild ... and say I need to claim asylum because our country", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "21"}
