which is the home of the air force academy and we had season tickets to the football games\nAnd when I saw all the kid that's in their service dress run to the end zone and do push-ups whenever the falcons would score a touchdown I knew that I wanted to do that I didn't know what it is but it just looked at like ... really cool and so that had been my lifelong dream is to go to the air force academy and\nThanks be to God it happened I almost didn't get in and actually got rejected and then a month later he got a call from the the ... the senator who got me my er my nomination and and said hey you still want to go to the air force academy and I fell on the ground and it was so excited that my my dream was coming through\nAnd\nI served a five years on active duty I wasn't a chaplain actually a lot of people ask me that I I served as an aircraft maintenance officer in a air mobility command which is all the big planes and cargo planes and the arrow medical evacuation and air air refueling those planes\nNow one of the things when we were going through all the candidates I'm a for the new speaker one of the things that stood out to me was that you have a a distinctly different style in preaching did you talk just a little bit about how you develop your your preaching style\nMy desire is to be conversational and I think it relates back to the question I'm Mark asked about the challenges that we as preachers face today there's a there's a book you probably know the title as as one without authority or I don't remember who wrote it but that's we we can't\nAs preachers or the gospel it doesn't work as well the lead with our authority and so how else can we lead to connect with people\nConnect them to Jesus and so that was part of it is just a desire to be conversational to the desire for me to be interested in what I'm saying and to become a a student of the Bible anew every time I go back to the text\nYeah this is a unique opportunity now that you're just starting out and people listening getting to know you a little bit more if there was one goal that you had in mind for what you hope God would do through your time here uh what would that be\nWhat drew me to this organization is\nThat the love of the last and to focus on outreach and that's what my goal\nRight now as I can imagine it is to help that effort to be a small part of that larger effort Lutheran our ministries is much bigger than just the Lutheran our we're reaching out all over the globe but if I can be a small\nPart of that to speak to people who are on the on the fringe of the Christian faith or outside of the skeptics and the half believers and uh\nIt's a lot of us to go to church every week and so to try to speak to wear those to come together where a someone who goes to church but it's not quite sure if they really believe all this and and then the some someone who's completely skeptical about at all how can we reached them\nAnd so what I Hope from from the listeners is that we'd be able to create something that they could share\nYou know you you send send this to the the pod cast linked\nTo your grandson to your granddaughter your niece or

I'm the owner of the ... computer company service centers in Lincoln Omaha and to tell you an eight six six for nine six eight seven seven to that's the number to join us on the program today and that's what Steve is done Steve welcome to the show how can I help you on computers is\nWell I got a problem overnight you know I got to do and stuff\nAnd a skirt up yesterday and it will light up and right now I'm an auto repair couldn't recur your\nPC okay [laughter]\nOkay so you were saying you said something earlier that when your computer if you were using it if you didn't use it for a long time it stopped working or what were you\nJust overnight before you\nAutomatically shut down or if\nIt was going into sleep mode probably wasn't it's not coming back on asleep mode\nCurrently okay is it a desktop her laptop laptop okay um\nSo basically what I told my customers especially then this is one of the things this is the pro tip it's going to be in the catalog or one of them um when you have a computer that is plugged into a sea power whether that's a laptop or a desktop\nYou don't want to have the uh the the sleep settings turned on for AC power\nSleep sleep settings were designed back in the nineties for computers to save energy when they're not in not being used so everybody in the office go to lunch all those see our T's all those TVs on your desk turn off when they turn off they said the company a lot of dollar wise energy [noise]\nAnd that's a good thing right so basically when when they turn off that saves a lot of power will now with ... D screens and\nYou know everything else they're not using hardly any power at all and you can set the screen to turn off still but you can also said that the computer to stay on all the time because the computer will turn off its own internal components when they're not needed like the hard drive or the DVD dry for example\nUm so basically if you go into your power management options now you can't do this right now because your computer obviously won't boot right now\nBut for everybody else listening you click on start in the lower left corner\nThen you click on that little settings gear and you click on system in the control panels\nUm and yeah we should cut a video for this and put it up on the do it yourself section because I mean it it's not complex it's actually really easy\nBut sometimes walking people throughout his real helpful you know I had a customer on the ... the other day and we went around and around in a circle because I we weren't on the shocked I kept telling her to click start in the lower left hand corner and she said it's not there and I'm like come on now and I'm just thinking she doesn't know what start menu is because it doesn't say start on it it's just a little Microsoft Logo\nTurns out her menu is vertically oriented on the right hand side of pre screens or her start menu was actually in the top right hand corner of the screen\nOkay sorry about that now we got connected on the shock desk and then ... you know okay that's what's going on so we got her fixed up but you click start clicked settings gear you click on a system and you click on power in sleep\nAnd then in there it on a laptop there'll be two sets of options one for battery power one for a sea power leave the battery power settings alone it's okay for it to sleep on battery power because it's going to save your battery life we want that\nBut on AC power we never want it to go to sleep as if you click on that dropped on you can scroll all the way down to where it says never click never and it won't go to sleep anymore\nI'm now in your particular case\nIf you click on advanced options um you're going to have a whole bunch of advanced things that you can do one of the than the first things that you want to try is using a system restore point to restore your computer back to a previous time\nI'm so click on system restore now this is not factory reset\nThis is not reset my PC those are very different things\nThis is system restore if you click on system restore or it will look for any system restore points on your computer and if it finds any that are viable it will try to restore your computer back to the point in time when that restore point was made\nIf the restore fails for some reason that usually means you have a bad piece of hardware somewhere a bad stick a memory a bad hard drives something along those lines inside the computer that's not working well\nOn the other hand\nA lot of times there's an option in there that says reset this PC and this is kind of like the last ...\nHail Mary default play when you click on reset this PC what it does is it saves all of your documents and says all of your files\nBut it it it reinstalled all of your windows operating systems you get a clean install a windows all your files are there but you lose all of your programs so for example if you have a Microsoft Word documents you will still have a Microsoft Word documents you just won't be able to open it because you don't have Microsoft Word until you re install word then you'll be able to open it\nUh no of course if you bring it into the service center there are some more advanced things that we can do when we remove the hard drive from the computer and performs a maintenance tasks on it to make sure it's healthy to make sure that the the you know the file system is not corrupted there you know we rent check this there's there's things that we can do partition recoveries\nAre there are things that we can do to try to fix that problem but if you're looking for an at home do your self option those are the first two things I Would try and if I was in your shoes at home right now\nOh have you ever tried All right thank you Steve I appreciate it and if you have\nTrouble please feel free to bring it into any of the service Centre stress to help you out a right now we have worked through the October Russian all three service centers and uh we have open bench spots in all three service centers right now so if you have one of those prepaid maintenance certificates\nNow is the time to bring it in if you
