and I think\nYou know statistically speaking to Noelle and her surprise arrival but also her\nI'm surprised diagnosis\nI think that when we received that diagnosis we all reacted in a very human way we\nWere scared because we didn't know what that meant we were\nSad because we\nGrieved this idea of the life that our child was going to have\nTheir were element I'm you know uncertainty and fear of what other people\nGoing to think and how does this and you know how this is going to impact our family long term I started thinking about the fact that you know Perry and I may never have an empty and that and that's a huge\nThing to deal with and to come to terms with and what I didn't realize and what I didn't think about was the huge blessing\nThat we were going to get through her that was one of the greatest lessons that I learned\nThrough this whole experience so far\nOf God Bless us with her was just that once we got to know her and once we recognize\nHow amazing her differences make her\nHow kind and how unconditionally loving and how\nAmazing she is like she has to work so much harder than everyone else to achieve the same task that we all achieved quite easily\nThere is so much rejoicing rejoicing over little\nTiny things that you would normally take for granted those are the things that I feel like God has taught us through the well and when I watch\nThe way that our children are older children are with\nAnd the patients and the acceptance that\nThey have learned and the ways that they have grown in their opinions of people were\nDifferent I just feel incredibly blind\nBeen incredible for me to realize and I think it's so good reflection on her simple condition [noise] we get very ...\nBut up in looking at the the dark clouds of uh\nThe potential of something that happened and so you can get very focused on the challenges of bringing up a a child who has downs syndrome and and and\nReally just get so wrapped up in that that that's all you're\nThinking about and what we we fail to see is that there can be more going on than needs are so you know some people might not see a\nHaving a child come into their home is a blessing [laughter] she was absolutely lesson for our home and continues to be today because you know she became the sunshine\nThat we all were able to revolve around and be blessed by and and this you know the little person who is just beaming love\nYou know she has her over to my younger brother or something like that but I more often than not it is just about\nI I Want to love you I I Want to be happy with you I Want to smile I I Want to make you happy and\nWe all are were there for her and you know to help her with the challenges and so we learn more compassion\nAnd care and all these things and and that's what God was giving us was this opportunity to love and to serve\nIn and we may not realize that at first but wow what a blessing we've been given and it was so thankful for it\nYeah and even the blessing now of being able to share our stories with other people and hope that we might\nSomehow encourage someone else who\nAt the beginning of their Jamie I'm you know just finding out that they have a diagnosis dancing or my child you know prenatal a year after they're born or someone that they know that\nYou're that that hopefully it will just help people to open\nTheir mind to\nRefrain thing think about things a little bit differently that this isn't a burden or a tragedy\nThat this is life it's a little bit different but it's a blessing number law and um you know especially with all\nThe talk lately about you know prenatal testing and eradicating down from Ron in certain countries in the world and of course that's not what they're doing their job killing all of the baby that have Down syndrome these whatever word ... which is just heartbreaking\nAnd so to have the opportunity to go out to be kept limits on the cat thing like Richard Pryor dom and sharing\nThat story which is really

I use the example of calibrating a touch screen for you\nUm so let's say if you've ever worked in a restaurant you have a touch screen point of sale system um they require calibration from time to time\nSo what you do is you run the calibration program and they put a little cross here on the screen and you touched across here and you touch the next cross here and the next one in the next one all four corners then you touch the middle and then basically the computer says okay we know where the four corners are we know where the middle is now we can map everything else on the screen\nAnd then all of this if you run the calibration program again it puts the same for cross hairs on the same five crosshairs on the screen doesn't all over again basically what you did is when you calibrated your screen color a screen calibration are are designed for people like my wife right now is working on the holiday special catalog\nUm she wants to colors that she has on her computer screen to match the colors that come out of the printer when it goes off to the printer because you don't want to print what you think is royal blue and haven't come up purple\nUm so you need to calibrate your screen to match whatever the printers color calibration is\nAnd so you'll have people then graphic design understand especially in photography understand you must have a screen they actually make calibration filters and go over your screen to ensure that what you see on the screen is what's going to come out of the printer when the prince of the picture\nSo what you did as you calibrated the screen so I think she made an adjustment to how the screen looks\nAnd then it said that as the default calibration now that's the new normal so you're you're ... you're spiders didn't move you moved what normal was if that makes sense yeah okay and so now normal is in the middle again and if you make more adjustments\nThat's changing normal when you come back again the spiders are all be back in the middle but the changes will still be applied\nOh I think maybe on that first tablet devices if I go into profile [noise] I can\n\nAssociated with this device that's called the profile [noise] and I like checking checking the setting for this device that can remove that is that the fault that it said the new normal\nAh yes the the ... whatever whatever it is that like I guess\nHere's the thing the the slider as your adjusting are not um setting aside as like you think of the mouse sensitivity slider you can slide it left or slide it right to make it more or less sensitive um you can change a resolution up or down on the slide or to make it had been larger or smaller on the screen\n'em but when you're adjusting the color calibration that color calibration adjustment changes what normal is so it ... a little bit\nYou know and that's how new normal\nFor example you can go back to it it's always or your left it was it fun [noise] I I just I just changed the normal so\nOkay that was my question\nI had no problems ... thanks a lot Dale I appreciate your call we also got you into drawing for the twenty five dollar shock innovations gift certificate eight six six for nine six eight seven seven to All right so\nUh we talked earlier about Microsoft halting the rollout or they are going to resume that once they figure out why the intel hard\nComputers with an intel chip set it in and tell solid said hardly ever deleting all the files doesn't make any sense but it's happening they're going to fix it they'll push it back out my guess is that they'll push it back out pretty quickly here\nI'm so in the meantime if you've install was shock you don't have to worry about that same upgrade did not allow your computer to install the update if it thought your files were going to disappear and did not allow it\nWhen Microsoft releases a new version we will be uploading that new versions so say people using safe upgrading the future we'll get that new installation rather than the old one\nBut if you want it installed we know what's causing the problems we can do it in the shot for ya just bringing in the shop\nAnd we'll take care of it so eight six six for nine six eight seven seven to the big hack\nHow China used a tiny chip tiny microchip to infiltrate U.S companies as we mentioned in the previous segment or did they attacked by Chinese spies reached almost thirty U.S companies including Amazon apple and compromised America's technology supply chain according to extensive interviews with government officials", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Compute This", "city": "Omaha", "day": "07"}
