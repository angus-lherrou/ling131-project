{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "Looking ahead to next week's program it's going to be an important day here for the Lutheran our because Dr Michael Ziegler is going to make his debut yeah the next Lutheran our speaker Tony what do you think about that\nI think that's great [laughter] um as as one who has filled in 'em over this past year when we have been in our vacancy speaker I'm thrilled to have him come here\nI Am also thrill because he brings to the table such a vibrant and unique way of proclaiming the gospel\nAnd um every time I hear him preach\nI learn something new from it I'm engaged by it and I know that our listeners will be as well so I Can't wait to have him here not only and you might not know this not only um does he preaching the Lutheran our but he's he's a member of our US ministries team\nAnd so he works with us in in the development of our programming and figuring out um the ministries that we're developing and he speaks into that that\nProcess as well so uh well he's a voice or on the radio he is also a valuable partner in our United States uh outreach of the gospel as a whole\nI think our listeners will discover that each speaker brings their own different style and to the program in the case of Dr Ziegler I think he's going to make use of the radio medium in a special way talking about that the editor of the mind and you know making use of his voice to bring the words alive to the listener\nYeah he has experience actually in um doing the gospel of mark from memory in connection with the gospel mark program at Concordia Seminary in St Louis\nIt's amazing to hear him recite scripture from memory and he just doesn't remember it but he embodies it ... and um he presented in a very engaging way\nI remember that when we were going through and and having people record sermons and you know things like that during the interim the first time that I heard him the first thing he did was he read the Bible passage\nAnd I was like wow if the sermon is as good as him reading the Bible passages who's going to be great but he has he has a talent for interpreting\nAnd he has a talent for conveying with his voice and I and I think you said the or the mind is a great way of doing that when you listen to him preaching close your eyes and you can visualize a what's going on in the message\nAnd just a heads up for our listeners I think this is going to be a case of active listening being called for on your part it's this is not going to be the sort of thing where you can have it just kind of\nGoing in the background I think Dr Siegler really captures and engages your imagination and requires you to follow along carefully 'cause he's going to take you on a journey with his sermons\nYour salvation free but listen a little work you know I'm no he's uh\nHe is engaging and to follow along with him and I was I was a similar professor for a number of years so I you know I think I've heard a lot of things\nBut the way that he presents the message I think okay I haven't thought about it like that before and my only problem is that while he's preaching I start thinking and I started going down these walking I Wonder what that's like and then I have to remind myself to keep listening because he's brought up these topics that are so engaging\nIn presenting them in ways I haven't heard before so um he's he's a gifted preacher but whereas we like to say he's also in many ways challenging\nAnd the fact that he's not going to say the same thing in the same way\nBut that he's presenting to you know in a fresh way and engaging way in a stimulating way\nTo learn how you can support the worldwide outreach a blue so we are in our ministries go to lose to run our dot org or call one eight five five John three sixteen that's one eight five five five six for six three one six\nOur email address is in ...

X. see and you can put like a space forward slash ass for silent\nOr capital s or fewer for quieter cue and for quiet network mode er and basically it'll install it quietly as if a network administrator was deploying it on thousands and thousands of computers because in essence that is what we're doing\nA adobe changed that flag however and so the guys over a truck interactive are working on getting that fixed up I'm so go ahead and quick update on that um that\nThat single pop up that comes up a and then finish when it's done and then that'll get you through that update and then the rest of Europe it's will go through successfully just a little footnote therefore secure update or\nEight six six for nine six eight seven seven to All right so let's jump into some of the stuff here or we talked about windows ten or we got the updates going there um the fake moon oh my gosh the fake news stories that are before go though is jumping to those calls ed welcome to the program how can I help you today on compute this\nWell a truck or my secure up they're gone wacko okay what's going on [noise]\nIt it's a good to update or do the flash player okay and when it gets all done get off the screen and at the\nInstalling a hat for the reader right and that and go on a for maybe five days and um get her to install on this thing oh\nGotcha well should only installed once when you do is to button clicks you have to you that's the patch I was just talking about um so when you click update it goes through and does the update and you have to click finished it to complete the update otherwise yeah native will keep launching it over and over and over until you actually get it done\nYeah I I it and stuff and I was in the store yesterday okay and\nThe same frame handmade voice as regular laptops we've removed half of the movie part well more than doubling the computers to be the result laptops and two windows in seconds or less response instantly to your command heads and survive drop stepping most laptops into the data recovery laugh\nStarting that only four Ninety nine dollars the laptops gives you speed reliability durability ... performance for the same price most people pay for cheap disposable laptop\nThe next time you're looking for a laptop checkout to solve the laptop that shock innovations dot com or visit any of our service centers simple solid fast technology\nIs why we do ...\n[noise] and now confused as pro tip number three hundred and Seventy three [noise]\nEveryone knows we're supposed to back up our computers and then check those backup periodically to make sure they're working [noise] why don't most people do it and lots of people have different ideas about what backing\nUp me a copy and filed a flash drive did they use in a fancy backup program and how do you know it's working anyway windows makes ... easy through free software that's already on your computer open your control panel a click updates and security\nLike a backup and choose from all the available options to get a regular revival checkup\nYou'll need something to back up to like a shot modular storage device or some other back hard drive\nBack up usually run once a week you can always change the frequency of the best part is that if you're ... you'll see a notification the lower right Puerto\nFire clock telling you something up backing up your important data has never been easier to take a moment to the back of your computer today misquoted ... by tracking invasion computer company\nThe computer equipment today and try to make sure it's probably recycled and put to good use right here in US this broken Roger you by truck innovations computer company [noise]\nFox News on that he had like a caravan of migrants from Central America are still trying to eventually enter the U.S\n... very very bad people in the caravan you have some very tough terminal elements within the care of it [noise] but I Will seal off the border before they come into this kind of bring out our military is not our reserves covering at our military\nPresident Trump at a rally in Nevada and south Georgia officer Antwon Tony died following a shootout with two suspects\nAre have been a big shock to the community and to the county police department\n[noise] chief of police butch airs police are searching for the gun then hurricane well on growing rapidly could hit Mexico by mid week this is Fox News\nNow the news radio eleven and Kay of ab whether watch [noise]\nA chilling story\nAlready beginning to pick up out of the south and those winds are going to increase as we head into the middle part of the day go up to thirty five miles per hour that is going to bring in some warmer air we shouldn't be near sixty by lunchtime Ohio around sixty eight degrees across the Omaha metro\nWhere the Omaha most accurate forecast I'm six news first alert meteorologist David killer a news radio eleven ten K. if maybe\n...

I'm the owner of the ... computer company\nAre with service centers in Lincoln Omaha ... where we fix computers we build websites are we recovered data from lost or damaged ... when I last heard guys if you lose your hard drive in order to recover a but if you still have it and it's broken you know we can recover the last data\nOr as long as that's lost in there somewhere um you know basically if it touches a computer we handle it over a truck a corporate services onsite will come up to your house to a it's a it's a good day over a truck innovations eight six six for nine six eight seven seven to All right so before we get to the Chinese moons story and Richard's call here\nUm\nThere's this non player character thing going around it's a mean going around on Twitter I'm I'm going to see if I can I'm gonna try to bring up a picture\nA PC mean I'm\nI'm gonna try to bring up a picture of it for um for people to see on\nA on Facebook here I'm Sorry oh here's a story\nWhat is it this this is the story from the New York times what is and PC the pro Trump Internet's favorite new insult\nOkay so basically end PC is an acronym it stands for non player character\nA non player character in the video game is a computer generated character in the game who has a very limited set of lines so imagine you're playing a game where you are the main character and you walk into the bar and the bartender has three pre programmed greetings like whether you have today or you know what are you a drink and\nGood day outside isn't it you know those three things and that's all the guy can say you could you could ask every question and you can say why is China trying to launch a fake moon and he'd be like what you're drinking you know he just doesn't he says the same thing he parrots back\nThe same thing whatever his programmers have told him to parrot back regardless of if it makes sense or not regardless of if it's true or not they just keep parroting the same thing back if you've ever watched cable news shows you get a quick lesson in in ... both sides do it\nIn if you say it often enough\nPeople will start to believe it and you hear these people doing this all the time well that's what an end PC a non player character and so this mean God created non player character and they have a generic little face logo that you can put on them so you get this guy and basically someone says you're a non player character in other words\nYou're just some mouthpiece spouting off whatever your your your political programmers have told you to say you can't sing for yourself um and ... you should you should basically not even be listened to\nWell of course people on the right grab this and started running with it for people on the left people on the left started complaining that this was dehumanizing and the reason they use that specific words ... humanizing was very specific um because Twitter has a policy against any dehumanizing\nOffenses and so basically if you tweet that somebody is an NBC you'll get banned from Twitter so if you want to see if you can get banned from Twitter grab one of these non player character means and re tweeted retweeted off your account and you'll have so many people it's\nCrowd basically everybody from one side of the political spectrum will come and label your account as offensive at once enough people do that the robo ban hits and then you get banned from Twitter\nSo it's it's pretty cool stuff so if you want to get yourself banned from Twitter maybe you want to open a Twitter account just to see if you can get banned on Twitter you know this would be the way to do it eight six six for nine six eight seven Seventy Richard thanks for hanging on the line how can I help you today on computers\n[noise] Ah yes I'm here with you OK well I'm the guy that goes to the library you remember me up I remember you oh\nThe one guy that goes to the library well [laughter]\nLonely there [laughter]\nAnyway uh I I waited for getting the all clear from you\nYou know the the bats Microsoft occurred and now all was well I agree with your stores now and finally the thing and they had a ... for me I brought in my PC for the eighty dollar upgrade your ... going to do in\nOkay look at it and friday and you go to Kyle yeah who's been a heaven\nSent guy every time for me was there he took it in and he personally the upgrade\nThey called me friday night said come get it okay so Saturday when the traffic isn't quite as crazy I drove up there [noise] unfortunately Kyle doesn't work\nThat day right Brian with their okay\nBrian and as always I was your lobby and make sure everything's okay and there were multiple\nProblems okay what were the problems with the king one is and this is what I call Brian I'm going to talk to you on the radio tomorrow okay the endpoint did not funk [noise] okay\nMy account is paid they verify that that they're at it it\nIt was there was no no protection at the both of their little indicators were on that it was non functioning\nOkay so ... let me stop you there for just a second um when you have a a laptop especially or any computer that's not connected to the Internet for a period of time for example if we shut it down on friday and\nYou came in Saturday morning it can take up to eight hours for all those great question marks to become green check marks again because the system has\nTo re synchronize with semantics servers when it's connected to the Internet\nUm well go ahead I Want to interrupt\nBut I've done in the same scenario mhm and I've never had an [noise]\nBut as a bill has it been at the same time when several million computers were doing an update that were requiring it to reconnect to the Internet\nSo that that that's we had a lot of I mean look at you\nKnow there's there's basically there's two sets of check marks in the end point the one if you're connected to the Internet the one at the very bottom that says connected semantic that one will turn green first if that one is green at the very bottom of the window then the other ones it's okay if they're great on the other thing you can do is if you want to try to to cause\nIt to synchronize more quickly you can click on checked for updates if it is successfully able to go on line check for updates and download updates\nThat's or even though it won't tell you that everything is validated that's a validation that you have a subscription that's about it and so when Brian checked in on line with our portal he just says yes you're there it probably also said in there that you were also off line", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Compute This", "city": "Omaha", "day": "21"}
