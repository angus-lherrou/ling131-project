{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "I also think that when it comes to fear that it is something that can set of hedge or a boundary so that we remain faithful to God and then there is I'm\nNot like a horrifying kind of fear but a a fear when we look at God in who he is honoring him and that's a kind\nOf fear too and I would say that's a that's a positive fear as well\nYeah uh actually the first use of the law would be an example of a healthy fear the fear of running afoul of the authorities that God has put in place\nThe curb that yeah restrained you from acting out on whatever sinful impulse you might have that might be against the law so in that case that would be a healthy a fear that\nIf you are correct so like the the the first use of the law um why do people obey the law in in that sense it's because they're fearful of the negative punishment [laughter] and so it's like oh well I'm not going to do this because I don't wanna go to jail so you're not really a doing things for\nA wonderful virtuous reasons but because you're fearful of the\nPenalty but at the same time it's not like the man's trying to keep you down you know I mean it's it's really about protecting you as well as a maintaining stable society so\nWhile there's fear involved the overall goal isn't simply tear the overall goal is to\nMaine taint peace and to keep us protected and to keep us healthy\nIn the sermon Dr Hoffman said that all fears are really mirrors of the one fear the fear of death would you agree with that\nI agree with that I might put it a little bit differently to me death is one kind of loss okay and at least for me personally I think that a lot of my fear is connected to loss a death being probably the largest one but\nYeah I I Would say that the death as a former loss and if you think about it that way that many of our\nFears are connected so uh we're fearful if we're gonna lose our job or if we're going to lose a relationship with someone that we love or if we lose someone in in death or if we're going to lose part of our identity you know or part of our freedom um all of\nThose I think go back to last for me\nAnd made it made it tells you a little too much about who I Am I'm but fear of loss of of of many kinds has has been something that that I've dealt with over my life it also I think it exposes the fact that\nMaybe we think that the things that we provide for ourselves are the only way that we make it through this world\nAnd if we if we lose those things we're not going to be able to go on\nSo I think it probably also says something about my understanding of my of my trust and and my relationship with God and those kinds of fear\nIt seems to me that fear it could also be a result of uncertainty not knowing where things are going to go and so you fear what could happen\nThat exactly yeah I'm I'm One of those people that I I I'd probably do myself\nA harm by thinking about all of the possible results of a situation you know so I can\nImagine like forty different horrible things that could happen you know I'm so uh I I tend to I tend to let my mind think through those things and sometimes I noticed that that will that will actually\nImpact me emotionally that I Will be fearful about a consequence that I have determined to simply be a possibility in my mind\nAnd trying to realize that there's there's plenty of real things to be fearful about instead of just being fearful about the thousand things that I make up\nIn his sermon Dr Hoffman says when fear is so thick you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light again no matter what may happen there is God in where God is no fear\nNow I couldn't agree with that more\nYou know as we're talking about this I only thought of the illustration as I was coming down here about the story of when I was a child\nBut thinking about that statement and also thinking about some forty six that he's using them is that a a a mighty fortress you know kind of thing I thought well I Know of course I didn't know this but uh in a way I was kind of building a fortress your own little ... with prayer\nBut that is true in the darkest times God is that defense he use that lights the cuts through that darkness we also know from scripture that a lot of times we don't necessarily see the light of God in less it's dark\nOr to put another way we see more clearly are more brightly or when it's dark\nSo it's interesting that when you talk about faith and you talk about people's relationship with God through Christ that if you asked them to tell you a story about it many times they are going to tell you a story about darkness\nA story about fear a time when God made a difference in their daily life so in many ways without these times of fear without this times of broken his without these times of darkness\nMaybe we wouldn't understand God's graciousness and provision as much as we do today\nTo learn how you can support

to do something like now okay maybe I'm spoiled okay I'm sure a lot of you have computers at home when you push the button something now it doesn't happen you know you have you have patients it's a virtue virtue of which I don't have a ton of so\nThere's there's patience is a virtue and then there's the patience of job I had a computer in the Lincoln servicemen and when we went to turn it on and and of course she wanted to show me the problem on the front desk right there was a line of people so we went to turn the computer on\nNo I'm not even exaggerating four and a half minutes later the thing was booted up and ready to be ready to be used\nA ... one point I restarted the darn thing 'cause I thought it locked up\nNo it was just that slow as you go see this is what I mean I mean you never used to be this slow\nAnd uh so we started looking into it and sure enough just like a lot of other computers out there all these patches that have come down to patch all these security
