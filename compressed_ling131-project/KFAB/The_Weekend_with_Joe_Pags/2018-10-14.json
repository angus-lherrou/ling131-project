{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "Is that if you have a hundred thousand you take out a hundred thousand I traditional put it into raw you owe tax as ordinary income taxes on that hundred thousand dollars but but what happens is most people not all the most people are very heavy on the traditional side not as much on the wrong side in converting\nIs a could be a very good idea so what happens if you have a hundred thousand thinking about a partial conversion\nSo you take ten thousand dollars I in all of a sudden now you're maybe going to oh let's say you're the state and federal law to thirty percent tax bracket you'll three thousand not thirty thousand like you would if it was a hundred thousand and you convert year after year after year also if you're thinking about converting maybe you wait\nUntil you go in and you are retired because then your income most likely would be lower and it's better to have income coming in taxable income if your income is lower so maybe you wait until you retire so what what we do is when people come on and we're going to really kind of look at your full financial pitcher\nAnd find out ... and I and I I've always said this and it is true\nIf I make you a dollar\nInvestment money you just earn a dollar not counting about taxes you earn a dollar if I save you a dollar in taxes it's just like making a dollar so if you can turn traditional to tax free\nThat in itself anyone who's paying taxes would love that but there is a tax burden on the conversion how do you go in and less than ... parcels or there's some other strategies to that we talk about so yeah we do a lot with Ross um IRAs and tax free Ross conversions\nAnd again that the like you said spreading it out over time that ... I mean you can convert a lot of money over time and and by the time you retire or even if you're in retirement five years later I mean that is that's there for that tax free money\nThat's a big deal and also remember this there's no required minimum distributions on or off okay so what happens is is that\nIf the if you're married the husband of take if he passes the wife does that take if they both passed the children do you have to take an R. M. D. but it's tax free in Second Life\nYou know what the traditional irate seven half you cannot add or put in on a new investment in traditional higher after Seventy half but as long as you have working income you can with the raw so Ross are you don't get the benefits up front\nBut you get it down the road and I'll tell you what many times especially if you're in the middle of higher tax bracket a rough makes a lot of sense\nHey you know we've got a question on the way here and uh I think we've got to go through this quick let's let's give it a little okay so here's the question I've been bombarded with ads featuring low cost rubble advisory platform that have a lot of online financial planning told one of these tools lack that an in person financial planner can provide how about a personality [laughter]\nYeah yeah there's a lot of information I'll robo um you basically computer um account generated show hype a platform yup\nAnd Tom buys the you know I'm I'm a human being this is my business I think I bring a lot of value to the relationship on investing but I Will say this it's certainly could be something to consider 'cause 'cause it it's good to have a lower cost than if you go to a financial advisor like myself there there's there's virtually no\nOr extremely low human interaction when it comes to robo advising now that platform\nHas only been around in this market it was not around to find\nOut what a great point what a great yeah\nSo we're talking about um a motion earlier in the show yeah and emotion right well what things are going great you know what ... everyone is good at what they do ... everybody's making money\nBut the most important thing is when the time comes that could falters we've not had a bear market a twenty percent decline\nIn over nine and a half years normally happens just over five years historically almost double the time periods so when that happens and and and and those robo advisers who's going to hold that clients hand who's going to call them and explaining was doing who's doing in in in and saying hey we need to rebuild not then\nBut beforehand so no doubt I have some bias there because that's the profession that I'm In ... we think we do a very very good job of talking with our clients\nThat I think has always done is kind of pick people's interest than let's uh let's open up the phone lines again listen folks to get us a call come on and sit down and talk about that plant talk about making things right\nIf you'd call during the show and our one of the next five callers we're going to offer a compliment

really said why and again I don't really care why ... why she is not an expert\nI talked about this well I've talked about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time\nAnd we set ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence on them\nAlyssa Milano is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense yet the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think\nThat she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers and general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like a like me\nTo buy you end up as far left wing garbage listen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't help their side they think she does but

of these current events websites there's Alyssa Milano and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe all isn't a lot I'll be cause filling the blunt\nJust doesn't happen

believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ...\nPeriod end of story and of course that's only period and the story of your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you all know that the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Robert are they telling the truth yes\nBut it's also a sin of omission or lie of omission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd than they are fantastic it's worth it's the best thing I don't get on my my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar [noise]\nA better thing to say it might be what he really

having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole for Black Friday just people no I was actually this was unfolding on me or love you are listening but I was telling them what was going on and and

is listening to the fact we get pumped a lot and you get so thank you for doing that and it was funny I started getting a call from the tax people up here in Los Angeles I don't know what I'm going to have you ever tried to verify me\nWell I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from Sarah ... dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said you have an iPhone let me face time you'll let's just settled this once in a row in as good as we got to figure that figure so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing [laughter] by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all these but I Try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you brush the bug you took my first time and very ... like what we heard such as you say that's her that's\nNot how you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sure I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski became a senator or as a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican argued support Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the reason she says you couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDid the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even\nWrite in campaign after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank workout after having served twenty two years in the U.S that he gave his daughter the job when he was elected governor up here right there on\nAnd I ran against him in defeated him for it that's how we got and that's how we said they didn't essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have these special interest from around the country right up funding you you know you should have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote against Kavanaugh because as you point out she said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about golf courses and whether either good matter yes I'm so no it\nDidn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles Alaskans are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested as you it outright set on friday the things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its grass having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you are you or your wife wasn't up in our circuit court of appeals at all ... opinion of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party ... and eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain has been writing my mother's name until you got on the ticket\nAnd then I voted for you show and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost everywhere we would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was so impressed because nobody else was talking about that they share um what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the night circuits had she had her her way and that's the nights circuits outta\nFrancisco right he talked about injustice\nAnd justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court sixteen million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far um the second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan\nVery liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power\nAnymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that uh that was that very very dangerous another thing is that\nTrump President Trump saw the light and is allowing Adam are only two decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has in terms of resources to help our country become more\nEnergy independent that inherent link between energy and security energy and prosperity staffed and our that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere\nThat Lisa would put that in jeopardy and Trump\nGave that to her he gave that to her to Alaskans but it was through her and for I mean that was a\nReal nice thank you Trump or ...\n... it just it just doesn't make any sense of Sarah Palin of course you know ... I'm a I got to jump on that we're relying on people in the middle East that don't necessarily like gosh\nWhy not going to and from what some of the ... hundred years where the oil there and then we're why wouldn't we go and get to become self reliant and turn this big it off to these bad guys and by the way we used to Murkowski voted no I Want everybody watching and listening especially those of you in Alaska she voted no on Capitol\nOfficially it's an it's a a a president vote because later she changed it for dangerous going back to his daughter's wedding so she said I'm just going to vote president disorder counterbalance what his vote would have been\nBut she on the record in the first round showed no\nLiterally am absolutely so that that's typical political ... that's a typical politician wanting to kind of play both sides if she truly had a problem with Kavanaugh being on the bench and she said he's not the right man for the bench then she her\nBoat then at the final vote what a reflected that instead of saying oh well I Do this because it's not really count anyway you know it's really believe something if you have that cup is pointing due north knowing what the right thing is to do then you fight for that but instead\nVery wishy washy and should learn you know ...\nGet hit on both sides ...\nIs there a building a former of our soldiers nominees for the Republican Party to vote was all over the governor's race native of Alaska in just a great person and I love the we're having this conversation are you going to take a wrong because your tweet might have been the best we are there were seen\nWhile media rights are fairly common and media right hitting a car is nice car is after all a very small objects on a very large planet in fact as far as scientists now it is only happen twice before once in Illinois during the Nineteen thirties and one's in St Louis\nAnd this week in Nineteen Ninety eight the U.S house of representatives votes to proceed towards impeaching president\nBill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice\nBy December Nineteen Ninety eight the Republican led house had gathered enough information from an investigation committee to vote in favor of impeachment which in turn sent the case to the Senate Bill Clinton was the first president to be impeached by the house of representatives since Andrew Johnson in Eighteen sixty eight Johnson was also acquitted\nThat's your look back at this week in history you know\nKnowing them pressed him like\nGo to know your girls down\n... on ... or\nEven I Would call them the wrong\nSide of this young talent and body to join with a hospital on line she'll listen every Friday night during the last\nThe other hand hey baby [noise] great\nTo have you as the weekend with Joe ... one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven\nZero eight zero truly great to have sort of on the program a an interesting story interesting backstory I I've been requesting that have run the program for a few years\nTo be honest with you and I think she's got some really good protection you know around her because I Want to be ever got her the word I had no clue she lives in my show every day and I guess they hit the right buttons that one day and getting that anonymous strange a message on Facebook\nEnded up getting the interviewing and hopefully we'll have run again and again and again um I Do hope she runs native Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski showed that she is not who she told Alaska she would be when she said she'd be a Republican there is no reason for any Republican\nOr anybody who's a conservative a traditional American values person to say no to Brett Kavanaugh uncorroborated allegations don't count\nI'm innocent until proven guilty due process do count\nAnd and hurt no vote was a ridiculous movies and I hope that people do ask are smart enough to get harassed out of there as soon as they can\nIt is one hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty will have energy secretary Rick Perry on the program which going all the energy sector what about this liquefied natural gas that we're sending over to the you know how does that help out and much much more we talk about that we've got um we we also have\nDug Adler he's a senior vice president Arabia Jean good associates why does the stock

for what I can catch it [noise] uh let's see that you got to\nTry to make those were you when you're asked me what I Want to talk about I mentioned that I read an article some time ago but I couldn't validate the article came from a change my question to\nIn this election how do we check invalidate it hurts involved counting of votes to make sure they can't corrupt the actual vote tallies critical areas of our country\nWell allegedly there are checks and balances in place but I don't trust it a lot of his electronic voting um I I think is is scary because you can hack these machines I don't know how to do it but\nWhat do you know these these guys out there do know how to do it if you're going to have to do our ... our government or hack into Facebook or acting to fill in the blank Yahoo um if you could do those things actually do a lecture machine\nI Would think would be very hard um so I don't know how we guarantee that I I got to tell you Doug I I've been voting for as long as I can remember and I can't tell you for sure that my vote counted every time I still go and I'll continue to go but we are leaving it to a very small number of people to validate something that that we all hope will vote that bill\nRight it's a great question I don't have a good answer\nYou know all of a sudden oh critic lectures and it's like\nOh why can't we have I just think that you're you might be referring to Minnesota where Al Franken wanted he shouldn't have but suddenly the votes that were somebody's car trunk it just doesn't make any sense and it is it's a scary proposition although our you bullied a little bit bother the election results or twenty six feet ... lectures about what that would have been the one\nBut I think they let their guard down a ... they let their\nGuard down because they thought Hillary Clinton was gonna would rather easily it sounds like our votes really do care but it's a great question I don't think there's any guarantee one hundred and five zero one

um but but I Know a little doesn't act\nOr fact [laughter] I I it's\nA I Know a little bit about history I pay attention I I Do a little dog and pony show every day I Would never ever have thought in my wildest dreams that the Democrats have been doing this\nFor Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago how they do the exact rising ... modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing on the ... of the Supreme Court so you're saying this is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens\nWhen you make a deal with the devil when when the left decided that the ends that they're ... getting power justifies the means this is what you end up doing your will destroy innocent man you will try and you'll use every dirty trick\nIn the book because as far as that can set it doesn't matter what I Do to another human being because I have to have the power\nAnd that was so important I I couldn't put it in my book you know why we fight happened off they came out but when the president stood up in the White House two days ago\nIn front of the world and pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did that justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounced him innocent that was a historic moment because justice\nWicket chambers within his says Seventy years ago so is justice Kevin ... a man who the Democrats

read the book so go and get that as well get the audio book as well so so let me ask you about this ... this whole idea from the left that\nThat you so well say actually I've talked to my my friend did go denounced as soon as about this as well he goes back even further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically was it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have a outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving you this justice Kavanaugh decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me\nBut is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and\nPull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House and a lot of people especially the press department said I I Am it's a strange one why\nBecause I refused I just refused flat out from day one\nTo talk to the the fake news I I ... I didn't care whether it was washed the post ... ... and it I said no why would I talk to people who wish to destroy this president I'm ready to talk on record or off wreck all the trouble is the majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh Harry\nThe majority of their status with a GOP Senate is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House they want the joke they want the approval of the New York times why they want the approval of CNN this is the problem\nAnd you know why that is so ridiculous number one they wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years and secondly who cares about CNN yeah you know I I Know this because of the White House book is you know how many people watch the most\nQuote unquote import show on CNN every night and this and ... have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it like he is the ... all the ... yes he is the king millions and millions and millions of us every show\nEver since ... the star of the Clinton used that work at night his show gets six hundred thousand view is\nAnd that somehow they're showing director Dr Gorka how how is it that people and you're right people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what interesting Cooper will say about them\nRight we have three hundred and twenty five million people in this country ...\nLess than half a percent what's what's on the ... if they were paying thanks to cut costs and we now that we now do they pay if they were paying the CNN to be broadcast in America's airports\nThat'd be three people including some who are watching this show is is what we have to break the GOP what the approval of these people but I Know what\nLast friday did you watch the press conference by the Republican Senate is\n... it really it was actually in power yeah\nThey were angry I have never seen them so angry at the Democrats that is costing behavior so you know what I think something's changed but everybody be deadly serious the midterms\nAre the most important election of our lives don't take it for ... go to vote pick your friends to vote if you like the last two years and you want six more we have to win the mid ...\nHe is Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies one last quick question I always appreciate the access and the friendship thank you and they'll show and I said oh well we're friends as well um will do when it comes to the left versus right politics I just saw an article by the hill\nThat says that millennials overwhelmingly are liberal leaning left they will vote left I also saw another recent polling I forget who the pollster was but it's a real one that says that suddenly the GOP as even things up for the race for the\nFor the house of representatives how do you balance that is zero fear in your mind as there is a little bit in mind that these young people will go and vote like drones for the left they don't know why they're doing it but they lean left\nUm and that will somehow counterbalance those of us who actually have studied these things that are more middle age or a little bit older that will go ... go to the polls to how how do you counter balance that you have a fear of what's going to happen in the house\nLook I I'm a happy warrior like Reagan I have an optimist I think we can we can we can take or we can keep the house keep the Senate the millennials are problem if you look at the victims of communism foundation they did a poll that said forty\nTwo percent of millennials want this to live in a social\nNot us or they may have the right one\nOr two is but but but you know there's two reasons ... number one ... a lot of ... he was just a vote that this is amazing God and you chew called Austin ... she goes by the name of flickers on ... ...

Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America to know and you might wonder what the heck is that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked about that we talked about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well a ... hour you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington\nDC for a few days here so you know taxes but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several\nPeople on your staff and I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on your your uh uh globetrotters now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa they be over in Europe to be over in Asia and they back home base it on your back over Indonesia where did you know that that was going to jail or this\nOr not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution rented that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight it would be an all those markets because it's you know we're\nNow selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries all five continent that's great and uh\nThere there's more to be done so I'm being there I I consider one of my job\nThe obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as a\nUh as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know as a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies\nAll of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIs the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining he's ... he's putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nYou use stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade them in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas no or you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously\nTalks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet for the cause of secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a a a role to play in that and and so absolutely there's\nA there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team I Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know\n... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine uh and and that's exactly\nWhat he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a young kid and came back in here or after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know the heads of blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a they know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese or they'll lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customer they don't want to screw with us that would lead them\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRight good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the guidance of a great job it now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage\nThat you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it as these things were outdated do you think about that North American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is when it was side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean\nCompletely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both\nVery different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president would say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U. S.\nM. C. A. United States to Mexico or Canada trade ... agreement makes total sense\nFor us to have done that we got a really not perfect listen uh you know I I I don't think I've ever negotiated deal while I was governor or otherwise that I Would call perfect but um this president understands how negotiate and negotiations are not\nUm [noise] without their challenges a button negotiations are generally uncomfortable you know comfortable for both sides but a President Trump he gets a man I'm so glad he's sitting at the table negotiating for us because America's went and uh I like when\nIt's all I Do too in the president's that will get tired of winning when I'm tired of it yet it is a former governor Rick Perry use the energy secretaries have United States of America you and I have known each other for more than a decade now if you can believe it and you've always told me that you believe wholeheartedly that we could export more oil than we import\nAnd people scoffed at that people left it but you also have said and I think we'll get there that we can be energy independent we're now exporting more than one importing you're not surprised by it um how did you make that happen how do we how do we as a country make that happen\nI Want to give credit to where it's really do and that is to the private sector innovators in technologies that are\n... you know George Mitchell is a great example of the man who is really the father of hydraulic fracturing you know a lot of people tell them it wouldn't work wouldn't work and he stayed with it stayed with it or when you couple that with directional drilling and I might add some of that technology of directional drilling that made it possible\nUh and as he is and that they came up at one of our a department of energy and national labs\nTo be able to allow the polycarbonate ... material to stay\nObviously a very safe it's not obvious\nIn fact we keep hearing about the breach is an open you're doing something about to protect yourself\n\nThe headline from NBC News so it could be fake news NBC News the same outlet that his pretending to president is holding Roberts Lee up on high while ignoring the fact that he talked a globally about Ulysses Grant beating ally but it it fits their narrative better to pretend like you said the part about lead\nSo NBC News fake news NBC says Facebook says hackers so personal info oh fourteen million people these supposed data including relationship status birth date hometown education and the Fifteen most recent churches\nFacebook said David Ingram wrote this\nFacebook said on friday that hackers were able to access to personal information of forty million people through security flaws of the company first disclosed last month and other data exposed and good information such as raising chickens and searches\nSo if you're not connected with me but you were able to hack into my account you know where I Am you know what I'm looking up\nIn other words I have no privacy of his website it all\nBack to the story Facebook sending a blog post that people would be able to check whether they were affected by the attack by visiting your Facebook help center on line the company also said that in the coming days it would send customized messages to users to explain\nWhat information might have had access to social networking company disclosed two weeks ago that the security flawed Facebook's view as\nFeature had allowed ... ended up potentially he joined potentially take over people's profiles Facebooking world's largest social media network of more than ... billion users has faced rising criticism that it's failed to protect people's privacy they disclose this year that versus the formation of up to eighty seven million people\nWas taken by the maker of a quiz up\nAnd then wrongly handed over to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica\nFacebook did not say who might have been behind the latest attack or certain groups of people were targeted but it said it was working with the forties including the FBI to investigate\nThinking about that you truly go to one of these Web sites and it's all Facebook is a freaking website\nSome do is made up a website and college in the hopes of finding hot chicks on campus though Facebook is what they started getting rid of ...

nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of pre existing conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care plan and keep your families who have their premiums reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer every new ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point

the lowest cost her mama care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year\nThey can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I didn't know where the premiums Lana complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guarantee remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if he can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you

I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... tank and he's ... he didn't work all the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational to think that politically people can make this happen\nA that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're\nKind of hurting yourself right if you're right ... thanks go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments of regimes that associates so as we watch this you know Obama when he was an officer and talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look I read I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst thing for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this do you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for his bridges\nYeah no I I think so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fats in the regulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive\nWe have an economy that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that\nIn consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet and in that regard I have to tell you this is really\nProfound to thanks [noise] first one is\nDebt service so that's just simply what comes in in income or into a household and then what goes out for ... like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting that you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better salesman they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash\n'em but you know what the media does the media has to find it\nLeave it bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's where the leading with it but when people generally watch or when you when you talk to your investors the people that that you work with or do they call you immediately say oh my God what do we do or or did they say well it's kinda crazy going to go out to eat now\nYeah so [laughter] you know what I mean nobody causes nobody calls me with their dinner plans [laughter] I'm gonna I'm gonna from now on but the British it call 'em\nSo I Do get some people are concerned of course in that apprehension that's obvious and makes sense logical also get folks on the other side that are looking to do some buying\nBut let me give you a little perspective so the market bottomed in March of oh nine so I was following the meltdown of oh eight and nine\nWe have had this ... this will be at the twenty third but we've had twenty three now\nCorrection sense over nine five percent or more and they average I sent us out the clients this morning just to give some perspective [noise] twenty three times since nine that what we're going through right now is happen average decline is nine point three percent\nWere down about six or seven now um but even today Joe I'm now seen on my screen as I'm watching\nA in real time we're starting to see some of the stocks the leaders ah which were technology these are the names we all know Amazon Microsoft Apple Facebook the companies\nUm we're down early today than down hard this month but now starting to sure I mean Facebook as an example and this is not a recommendation on Facebook but the shock was in August that over two hundred and ten dollars a share\nToday it's traded and the one fifty is now it was read earlier down on the day but now it's green\nMicrosoft same thing it was lower early today now that's turned up so it looks like we're starting to see a little bit of selective buying the average stock and this ... needle is moving but the average stock sense this sell off happened is down about Fifteen Percent\nWell pretty big correction yeah now here's the thing to you mentioned this it kind of in passing is too expensive is it over done the market is trading at about the price earnings ratio which that's just simply the price divided by earnings it's about sixteen probably right today's sixteen point to sixteen point three", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "14"}
