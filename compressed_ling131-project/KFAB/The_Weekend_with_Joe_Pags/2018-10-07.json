{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "See how it can compliment your Social Security I mean or or how your Social Security can\nComplement your four one K. and other out I think that that's a great way to look at Oregon yeah yeah and we and we we do a lot of we do a lot of financial planning when it comes around that area sure\nIt's a complicated process isn't it said I mean this is not that especially when it\nComes to the distribution part of of retirement you know you're you're getting there you really need help with understanding how that money is going to be youth\n[laughter] yeah it's um um you know there are a few people a ...\nA smaller percentage of the American public that this is their hobby they really enjoyed they're good at their big investigators\nHey that's wonderful mhm you should do it yourself 'cause remember Steve when you're working with a professional like myself there's gonna be something that you pay for that advice for their investment advice or yeah I mean I mean we get paid for a service whether it's a fee or a commission but there is some kind of cost and we want to make that worth your time\nTo go and hopefully with either\nThe possibility for better return of the possibility for less risk I mean we're trying to go in and match of what you want but you know what happens is is that you know one of the again I think this is a possible mistake but not Mac's thing out Iraq or not ... yeah or or your four one K. not matching those out so what's your four O. one K.\nIf you're under fifty the age of fifty you can put\nInto up to Eighteen thousand five hundred okay and then you can catch up up to six thousand once you're fifty and over so there's all that twenty four thousand and five hundred dollars that if you want to max out your four O. one K. or your ... be or for fifty seven ...\nIt may hurt a little bit right now\nCover and expenses but down the road so much more money to maybe pull it income from social I think that's one thing and then just Ross\nRoss IRAs and general most people here in Nebraska yeah unless you're professional okay a business owner but there are limits on on on what you know burning limit so in a rough IRA if you're single\nThe phase out starts at a hundred and twenty thousand at a hundred thirty five thousand you cannot it there's no benefit for the rough if you're married filing jointly hundred and eighty nine thousand is phase out in one Ninety nine after that then you can't do it so so if you're a higher income earner\nNo one's going to be pretty tough to go in and get the benefit of raw but for the majority of folks yes Ross contribution\nTax free after five years can really really makes it\nAbsolutely hey we've got a quick question how 'bout that okay good good great I'm sixty\nSeven years old now and want to delay filing and receiving my Social Security benefit until I'm Seventy my wife has also sixty seven and she is a non working spouse who was not qualified to receive Social Security benefit on her own earning\nAnd she has not filed to receive a spouse will benefit should she filed to receive her spouse will benefit now or can she wait til she's Seventy years old to get fifty percent of my benefit but it's like well yeah\nGet very good question yeah three key things here one is the wife the spouse the the wife does not have a benefit so so she doesn't have benefit her own show as a spouse would benefit but he has to file first okay he has to file first\nViolence a span is no longer available would help them back when there is no longer available restricted application is but what happens is\nThat where you're taking he wouldn't be taking from espouse benefit she doesn't have one so you know what\nWe get what we need to do is just kind of run a Social Security for we have an ... page report that show you how to maximize but I Would put in what happens if he goes in and he files right now\nOr whatever the goes in and files at sixty eight nine or even his latest Seventy find out what's going to be that the ... the the the potentially the biggest most maximizing Social Security benefit so hopefully they'll call and I can help them with our I that\nSounds great well why don't we open up the phone lines let anybody give us a call in and set up some time to come on and have a cup of coffee and that and talked about

C\n[noise] and\nThen there were nine I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News the Supreme Court has a full bench this week following the confirmation and swearing in of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nOn Wednesday the justices will consider another question that they've actually heard before and it's whether or not undocumented immigrants can be detained during deportation proceedings now that case involves an illegal immigrant where they prior criminal record\nBut who is no longer in custody or that should be very interesting and they now don't forget Monday Night at seven o'clock right here at the White House the president will have that swearing in ceremony for his newly minted justice Fox\nIs Kevin cork the Senate confirming Kavanaugh fifty to forty eight Republican Susan Collins on CBS the space of the nation cast a pivotal vote for Kavanaugh\nI think that this has been an awakening print this country I don't think ... had any idea how PR face that problem that sexual assault it's sexual harassment and yet we knew that Kavanaugh\nDenies all allegations of sexual misconduct some on the left already calling for his impeachment\nThere's only ever been one justice that's been engaged and I think talking about it at this point I'm isn't necessarily killing us in moving forward\nSenate Democrat Chris Coons on NBC's Meet the press secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying he a North Korean leader Kim Jong on made progress toward a deal for the north to give up nuclear weapons\n... speaking to reporters in Seoul President Trump tweeting he looks forward to seeing chairman Kim again in the near future a deadly tragedy in upstate New York authorities saying a crash involving a limo killed at least twenty people yesterday\nOfficials planning to hold a news conference in about an hour this is Fox News\n[noise]\nNow the news radio eleven okay a baby whether watch\nShowers and thunderstorms over spreading the area through that day some pockets of heavy rain will be possible rainfall amounts generally a round or less than an inch the showers keeping temperatures on the cool side high struggling to warm into the middle fifties this afternoon\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then to report that correctly\nThe second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was ... ... they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you're going to remember anything and then uh she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something\nHappened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it\nToo much Kavanaugh said no never did anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity\nIs Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party you went to ten of them and activity to she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for the another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the bunch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they rented anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today\nIs different or there are differences from the stories you originally told us her story is changed a bunch of times in history comes out especially somebody that makes he's got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible but that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lady that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because in the clubs all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent\nNothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a nutty from outer space story she's giving\nAnd of course the Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people in Canada who didn't come to ... offer of evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today\nHave these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls their dock sing people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots that are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us I mean listen mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh\nThey're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapists serial rapist your rapist on the court\nIt's it's a disgusting this way they are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to be in Saudi Arabia or something or China\nOh man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh again as I Do a show it's not happened yet but I assume but he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen between now admit it and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska\nWho is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nEdgy the reserves you gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now what what\nCome on man ... thoughts on this I I'm guaranteeing that you've never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee every

I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of the city I Will clear this room would be given interrupting than it would ... with proper protocol is but there were breaking it on purpose\nUs they really thought they were putting on the show which somehow women for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nYour back thank you very much for taking my call really you're at it uh\nI think the Democrats are definitely oh now they're [laughter] they're getting worse every month they are just getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down it's just it's very frustrating\nOr the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that pointing fingers at a man makes being healthy\nAnd you got to listen to both sides if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of class he's a very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut he he he's just a great guy and I just hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have due process in this country now and understand that that's what makes this country great everybody gets a fair trial\nWell they do understand that what it somebody on the left the energy Bill Clinton got way more due process that he was ever ... deserving of their um but he will he was on the right side if it's somebody in a what I mean the correct side for them\nObviously the less not the right side um but when it comes to somebody on the right of conservative Republicans are always guilty for themselves innocent and it just blew up but their faces this time it was interesting was Collins said yesterday\nThis isn't about you know I'm guilty beyond a reasonable doubt this is just the more likely than not and that still doesn't even happened is this is not more likely nobody but nobody says this happened except for the woman who said that it happened\nEverybody else she said was there not only said it didn't happen they completely refuted that they didn't they weren't leaving like I don't really remember no they they said he didn't happen so that's\nThat's a problem for the left they should have known this and now we're hearing that there might have been some tampering of the witness where we're her lawyers tried to get her best friend to change\nYour story I mean the whole thing is disgusting to be honest with you it's very disgusting it taking it by\nQuite I appreciate you open line now one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero ... dot com for Facebook Twitter Instagram and email a couple of new Instagram pictures from this past week yes one is in the gym get over it or the other one is\nI think we're just\nGetting ready for the show or something so again it's the red is just like a random

weekend with Joe ... we go back to the phone lines and say hello and welcome Jew or Christian you Carson City Nevada Christie what's going on\nOh lots of stuff going on [laughter] on TALK to me I just\nFind it very very hypocritical that here were interviewing this man to be a um fair and fair\nAnd honest person to decide that printed court cases where we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry when he was accused of these baseless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said victim survivor of a sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and ...\nAlso allegations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing to prove that was ... and if we let women like this come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying like decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate because women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that\nOr or many other things and the fact that we would\nWant this ... that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh who surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became a citizen and she is a hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country\nWe don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining this person for a job in a court where he's supposed\nTo be fair right and we get that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked unjustly\n... you couldn't be more correctly ... facing something one of the most dogs there are things I've ever seen it may be hard you know go and be fair and and liberal ended about this oh I'm Sorry to absorb that that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I Wonder do you remember the details of what happened\nTo you because this was lousy boar doesn't remember anything does that mean you just all the victims the survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered every book\nWhere she lost me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me agreement single parent household with that there were six cats when I was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't tell my mom right away\nBut I wouldn't leave her side for men right that when she first started to lift me was when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later when after she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure to say Hi\nTo someone that was in that room where I saw my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my home at gunpoint front of my family when I saw him in court I became physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us and I kinda find him\nBut I became physically ill and I have a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first mistake\nBut I can remember what I was wearing every single detail and both times every single detail there's nothing that isn't completely clear and cemented in my memory\nAnd I just I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and I honestly I hate data but I find are not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because I was in law enforcement and I know what the\nStandards are right my got on her is now she's\nIn ... but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with was before we let her what she says the word we're going to use as credible to everybody that we talked to\nWe're going to force them to all repeat credible 'cause then the the watching or listening public will will agree that she was credible but I I've I'm with you and I and I said there's really on\nMe I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible in fact that was the wrong usage of words and that's where I was I mean and I was attacked because I said but what so what I mean I saw what I saw heard what I heard\nAnd even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I I was away at how much I have personally been attacked\nBy either survivors ... victim\nBecause they allowed it to the point that likes me away as I had a guy friend that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve with your history Dr ... her I Would be doing a great disservice if I get\nI I ... we have to run great phone call I appreciate you taking the time we got somebody who really gets it\nWe come back we'll be Donald Trump junior here on the weekends

another six years so we need people in the house my father can't do it by himself\nHe needs like pet he needs guys like so many of your congressman that are up to help him get things done and to

um\nCatch up with Kellyanne Conway earlier this week\nAnd uh she of course is the counsel to president\n... the the president you know gives a ton of credit for his win in a twenty sixteen and we just got to talk about Kevin ... what was going on the economy as well the midterms coming up a ... to me it was inappropriate for a time and he joined Kelly and wants to be honest with you know we actually when I used to build for Glenn on a\nOn television and radio and the day I met Kellyanne Conway probably eleven or twelve years ago she was on TV show 'em back then so we've been friends for a long time a jelly and I appreciate ...\nI'm wonderful how are you today\nI'm doing great you you know I started out when I answered the phone I used to manage bizarro world and you actually very positively said you know really glass bowl right\nOut for me always as by Kavanaugh satellite fake\nAn honest wake up on the center I had in the mountain right I'm sure that great kind of a alive as president is doing a fantastic job and keeping us peaceful and prosperous ... you can you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think it's by the mainstream media refused to comment and they've never seen a positive data point that they had it ignored enough\nAnd I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy jealous God Forbid it ever\nIt was to go down but even if all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican Americans in Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans in women teenagers and veterans and and the growth rate is up but even today but it was very little coverage anywhere but there was an estimate of one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand\nSo the wages are up the job availability up people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits and that's what freedom looks like the deregulation agenda that the twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit courts and of course justice Gorsuch and and\nPerhaps soon followed by justice Kavanaugh\nIt's Kellyanne Conway a closer to the president are going to tell you you're in by the way she was also the woman that the\nPresident says really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when\nWe talk about ... they couldn't make any things that that they\nBrought him early on as you said they couldn't get him on the merits now let's go back and find out who he you know it might have started the auto was back when he was fourteen now the guys who abuse device allegedly somebody at a bar after you'd be forty ... ... was already I mean they really have nothing against the guy we have nowhere to stop\nThe guys who was Malone sitting behind him and you've got a\nFar left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out you\nKnow some of these witnesses I mean when you know not just for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with anybody were there\nAnd they're not they're also not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominee joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting judge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen\nCertainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this is this is about destroyed destroying a man's life because he he was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open in passing the terms of not three twenty twenty and America has had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford\nHas Dianne Feinstein a Democrat due to blame that she is now a household name recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelfth our hadn't told and\nBut for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's the Senate Judiciary committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens but if you're if you're a few of those\nRed state Democrats Joe pads you're really nervous today because you're caught between a ... on one hand you were Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism and toward destruction and resistance an obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as a symbol of your party\nAnd you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians\nAnd and and who's yours in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota now spread they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising can vending in voting for him\nIt's our tells rose would kill you in on wait till you do you think that there should be ethics committee investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her staff leak that out you said on this for two months she could have talked to tell them about a directly when they met probably\nYou could have brought it to the president's shoes you got the letter you're right she's not on a because you hope that they would be them down on the merits they couldn't the values supremely qualified to be in this job news are going to be an investigation should there be [noise]\nWell I saw some members say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week and say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the\nOf the letter and uh the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to Ford's lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to for that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nWell that ever happened to come to Washington either for lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and it's fair to tell us you know there are no cameras and clean lights in private testimony in California there's no Washington based\nObsessive media right to take to go and cover every jot until and the new client base for them afterward so that there are many things that could be investigated long after the vote for his confirmation happens\nIs the government is you're going to happen to your your bed as he's going to get confirmed Lindsey Graham says that he's not re nominated him yes they did see\nThat so leader McConnell said he's he's ... he's going to have a vote and this man will be voted on the one hand posing oppose him\nBut have the guts to say why don't pretend it's about X Y and Z you when you add already said you were going to pose any of Donald Trump's nominees from the beginning I wanted to mention is for all the talk about how energize\nThe liberals are and they're watching in suburban women I suburban women are smart enough to know that they are benefiting from an incredible economic boom market\nThat didn't happen by coincidence it happen through causation his name is Donald Trump even we haven't found one Democrat now who is trying to applaud the Trump ... his name is Brock Obama President Obama\nIs trying to take credit for it so he didn't get the talking points as Democrats but to say but the economy is not that great he's saying it's so great\nI'm taking credit for it but these suburban women also should look at this process and they should say I'm so much is going right but I also I also I'm so disgusted that people um hurt this woman used it as a woman for their own political grandstanding purposes and the case of a few of them\nUp and the Senate Judiciary committee to actually raise money for their twenty twenty elections they injected politics and what should be a decidedly non political\nProcess here and yes I think it will be investigated after the fact and and I think that people will be very upset about this for a long time to come to folks are watching and for all the talk about liberal excitement look at their ratings at the Fox news primetime lineup last Thursday after the testimony over five million per show that pizza that'd be\nThe um the daytime shows\nThe morning shows for the networks one too\nYou had asked every three hundred thousand lakes and they pay to the president's ... at that cannot just twenty four hours later [noise] that's a very high number of like for a presidential three so people are energized are watching not voted out there say\nWell I've got to tell you that eight out Debbie Stabenow is better than in the job for so long that it was when I was a TV news anchor there\nTwenty years ago twenty two years ago I was interviewing Debbie Stabenow she's been there forever and it is time for her to to go ahead and and uh and head for the hills I'd love to see a James when I taught and trying to get them on\nWe've got Fifteen or sixteen stations in Michigan on a on a Monday through friday show and I'd love to get them on I also I also watch duty to win the governor\nBut he's he's not looking very good right now we got to get him onto\nYeah I'm a you know the price of a vice governor he's a he's a socialist like I say he's a train wreck like a that a ... one from a queen\nWell they don't call it vice governor ... lieutenant governor don't they yeah lieutenant governor [laughter]\nThey get to socialize it we don't when we don't need and then what happens if something happened to her and it takes over\nNo I I hear you and I appreciate it thanks jury you know what's interesting is Michigan when red\nMichigan voted for Trump Michigan be smart be smart if you vote somebody like um like the left these I Want to give the name recognition\nOver I'm\nJohn James and over over bill shooting it doesn't make sense you're actually going to be voting for somebody who would go against the Tropicana me who would go against the good things that Trump has done for industry bringing jobs back we think about that if you really want that it would go backwards you'd be voting against\nWhat you voted for its when he's sixty there's no good reason why\nAnd by the way those have you voted for Trump to twenty sixteen she's done everything he promised he would do I can't imagine one good reason why you would make a vote on the state level or a local level that would go against that very it's very interesting to watch the process we got a line for its gotta be Bruce in North Carolina Hi Bruce\n[noise] what's your face in the fall and let's go do my brother what's happening yeah okay sure\nYeah hey I just want to say that uh I think what the Democrats are doing is is fantastic they should or could have doubled down and get more ridiculous than just fake everybody ... [noise]\nI agree with you I think that it's either going to make left to sit at home or some people who are moderately left might actually vote right because how dumb this whole thing was\nThat there's just craziness and they they need to just doubled down and do it again and and I and our next target and [noise] you know people\nBrother I Gotcha appreciated but what if what if\nVery odd vote situation but it was a I Know we put me on the speaker and walk away and when he got berries are louder you solved but Bruce I think it's a it's a point well taken as somebody who was a conservative in this country and I am I'm unabashedly conservative um I like to see when the left him floats and that's what they just did\nThose or just regular Americans who happen to be Democrats or or leave liberal\nAnd by the way I have no need for you I understand there's a different position different outlook I get it but as they watched Corey grow because Booker\nAnd and ah this\nRichard live lying about Vietnam Blumenthal and the way he for God's sakes they I Know and I've got friends who we left\nThere were embarrassed was embarrassed\nYou're going to vote for these people they just made a mockery of what it is you say you believe in let me say auto wrecking conduct you Rick what's going on\nHBO I can hear me yes come on your own meals go okay I got from the army man I Am\n\nDied there you go let me go to a live virus Blake in Texas I ...\nI got a question for you what kind of in a in a camp or whatever by about you know I haven't heard anything that ... thing but you know that might happen but\nOn the Internet she write him and the Trump rally in brothers of all the work for\nAn ...
