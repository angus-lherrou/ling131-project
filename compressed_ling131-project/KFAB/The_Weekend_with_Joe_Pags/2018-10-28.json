think one of the advantages of working with someone like you did with you know what Thirty years in the business you've seen ups and downs in the markets you've lived through them you help people whether those storms and and again that becomes to me really important to work with somebody that knows what to expect\nEven though I Know you can't predict it neither can I\nWhen I'm On a show like this I've got to be careful if I ever say the word guaranteed 'cause I got ya what actually is guaranteed but you know what I can guarantee that I can guarantee that in the future I don't know if it's six months one year two years five years ten years but there will be a big downturn him oh doc market yep\nHow does it get because everything\nEverything's circulates rotate so what happens is is that\nTrying to time of the market boy it's really almost a fool's game oh yeah stream Lee hard and you know\nI I I had a client of highly\nEducated he was up a plant manager here for a for for a big plant but what happened was\nI'm working with a a a good amount of money and and this was in the last election and he was a Trump supporter and he really thought Donald Trump would get in he thought the market would fall\nTremendously once he got in because of the certainty at all the problems there was in the election and so I said first of all I mean and I was wrong I I I I didn't think probably Trump would get and I thought the odds are against that in the second thing is\nIs I I I thought that the market probably would fall well he he took all of his money and put it into cash and what happens from gets in\nMarket goes down an overnight trading after hours trading about seven eight hundred points next day markets up two hundred and from there for the next week it went up up up and you know he did get back at a few days later but he's still missed out on four or five percent\nOff of a fairly large sum of money that invested it's it's a very very hard to go in and predict what in when the market would do and that's why and overall financial plan of having diversification asset allocation mean not all of your\nInvestments in stocks and bonds or in cash they could be an other kinds of investments to so having a diversity having a different allocation um maybe having something in guarantee\nYou that that's a pretty portfolio we look at different things we look at the good points the bad points and then put together a plan for you\nWell and again the part of that income plan to is is is putting some of your money in in that if the market does make that adjustment

strike out king [laughter] it's that too it was all Oregon and I tell you what happens is that might work in baseball but it normally doesn't work\nWithin investments in financial planning all or none attitude so we're a believer if you look at a um a roller coaster\nAnd you see the highs are very high and the lows are very low when we try to do if it was the Dave pamper rollercoaster\nWe the lows wouldn't we tried to have the lowest not be nearly as low and the most likely the highs wouldn't be nearly as high and maybe we can get a similar type of return\nBut not have those wild swings and I'll tell you what happens is wild swings when you retired and they don't have working income coming in it can be detrimental\nSo what we try to do is take get try not saying there's no guarantee that is what we try to go in and take some of those wild swings out as a portfolio ...\nWell again you have a lovely a peak there a lot of folks interest and it'd be a great opportunity to come on and sit

evening temperatures in the middle fifties by lunchtime topping out in the middle and upper sixties about sixty five sixty seven degrees across the Omaha\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's where we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made them do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced they were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual set into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this\nI guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump you have you were a make America great again hat you're a target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist than Islamic ... but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for ... that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example at the example of that but the media again playing the victim in fact Jim Acosta from CNN the other day tweeted out\nThis appointment or ... over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind this is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost and and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living and make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose your perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in at that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who've committed violence in there on the right same thing should apply\nBut this is elected reporting and there's the desired by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible or by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian is\nFamily or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or an American Indian the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic\nWho knows what he is when we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails and some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nWhatever the the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not drug or observe and then tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews I might take some false led called ... Charlie go\nI'm not going to do conspiracy theories today that that that's that stupid Charlie you can go ahead and hang up in Maryland I'm not a technical I'm All right\nOkay John Hi bushy use the guy from the um he's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan um Institute\nIn California great interview with him where we compare and contrast how Ronald Reagan on through his accomplishments treated was treated by the media and how he treated the media and it was a much better than what's going on with Trump\nAnd then how Trump does it very very different styles both of them had incredible accomplishments for the American people the media was not on either one of their sides how is it the that the media is Harold and Ronald Reagan\nAs a great president great leaders thirty

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border and deals with illegal immigration all the time or to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way\nAnd and what exactly it is that law enforcement is willing to or has to do as it gets here a share of our ... our you\nKnow great thank you for having me on\nIllicit always appreciate it really had a good time with your at the fair get together in Washington DC\nGot some great knowledge I have\nTo wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six want to do was standing next to you but ah it was a great time it really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw you out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to\nGo walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't steak I've seen some\nGo I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to two I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who\nGoes to church with me or my my kids go to school together but at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm going to see at the store these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what his what ... is gone on in their life to put him to this point so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect and we've tried to go in there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that humans can attract more flies and then you can then ...\nAnd in watching you interact in a good a sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like you know shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand but you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police we is there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those ...\nOr ... difficult to deal yeah and uh you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness power\nIf you walk up your calm and they can steal that they don't steal your wrapped up in ... it really helps that situation go a lot smoother even if you have to arrest it ended up going to last and food but there's some people that have just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and uh you can tell that immediately\nBut what I've learned from watching you would share of mark limping out County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like why PT and others um it is that when you walk up\nYou generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight that you know it's kinda it's\nI didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\n[laughter] just relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think if you just stay calm was work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to get back on a ton of charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nBut when I got pulled over and ... and you don't know what kind of cars have but when I get pulled over and it's often or I may have my hands are tending to I've got the inside light on a bit the window rolled down and I'm thinking ... who's the man or woman just walking up you know for the for the survey community sometimes that helps me sometimes it doesn't I have\nHad a ticket or two of my life but it also helps having the radio and TV show because I get to say hello to the officer on the air and that seems to get me somewhere too I'm sure mark lamb or should we talked about this in Washington how close to the border is pronounced county are you on the border\nNow we're not on the border we're about Seventy miles off the border and\nWe have an Indian reservation the town I'm Indian nation that's on the south into our county a very big Indian reservation that actually runs all the way to the border and across the board awhile part of the reservation in Mexico and\nSo it's a very unique situation that's one of the or their community as as a ... been opposed to a wall across their reservation\nWhich split them an honest look them apart yeah\nYeah and so and that's one of the big reasons it would split their reservation apart and so what happens is that there is only a three strand barbed wire fence across that area and that's one of the top spots where it's easiest are these people to come across it's about a six day hikes through the desert um\nUnless somebody a there's a coyote that transports him in and the ethical upright who so about five miles south of the I ... interstate\nIs where the reservation and and they have that five miles spot where they have to try to get across\nA lot of people don't realize on the other side on the reservation the feds would be responsible for charging training drug possession right now we have a they typically have a five hundred pound threshold of marijuana so you don't have more than five hundred pounds which any individual backpack or only probably as thirty to fifty pounds right\nAnd they know that and so they wait till\nThey'll sit right on the edge of the reservation and when they think it's a good time to make that last five mile push because if they get caught and put out county they're going to get charged with state charges and that's where the agenda\nSo to Omaha refinishing dot com don't replace refinish from Omaha refinish [noise]\nOoh [noise] Hi I'm ...

be\nI don't think that's asking much I really don't whether it be a school\nOr a movie theater or a church or synagogue or mosque or whatever it happens to be there should be a put a pretext a protective mechanism in place whether it's armed guards or bulletproof glass or you can't get in unless you're busting something has to happen\nBecause you can go down the list of all these places look at and we're talking about soft targets the movie theater where somebody can walk in the exit door or the movie theater that says you can't concealed carry here that's the future that's chosen or

Brady use the house ways and Means Committee chairman normal but what a what a ... first of all is a great guy so I could leave the house ways and Means Committee you use the committee that comes up with the\nThe the the way to do tax cuts\nThe way to deal with taxation\nKevin Brady worked very closely with President Trump to come up with a first tax cut plan which was passed by the house passed by the state of the president signed into law everybody who pays income tax got a tax break\n'em or carpenters got too much now shut up the corporations actually got an appropriate tax break it probably should have a Fifteen Percent not Twenty one um\nBecause they're the ones that employers they're the ones that have more money to pay cash bonuses or give us raises are more research and development of ... the ...\nThat's what we have\nUm we have corporations bring business back bringing manufacturing back and we're seeing an explosion in jobs in the GDP is looking great what Kevin Brady says he's working on the presence but losing alluding to this for the past week or so or they've been working on a another tax cut another tax cuts to point oh we're always going to happen\nImportant to me as a mother when you have someone who\nUm shelter for domestic violence or whatever that reason is who cares if somebody that's sneaking stuff their basic needs met we need to make room for than we serve a lot of meals and you know that I have made some really it's a lot more fun to peer potatoes and cook them answer them leaving to clean up\n[laughter] it's like at home

it's the weekend with Joe ... heavier I hooked up with the uh the chairman of the house ways and Means Committee the uh the the district that Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code word ... playing with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke and also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about Kevin I appreciate you how are you\nI'm good thanks yeah what what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get it to be a credible succession\nThe positivity that came out of at that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today a first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI says was this idiot but sent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you going yeah\nThat was my first time really a cop that that is good police law enforcement obviously it's kind of history of a problem and in in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this person that frankly hum and I don't know what how much would have been done you know can you imagine you know\nLike right now he picked or they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah I took a ... you know so much stopped talking about blaming politicians and let's do the investigative work out this is that's exactly\nWhat happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're going into the ... bomber they're calling for our good bomber ... new people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and\nAlmost killed these college they didn't call him a Sanders shooter or some yeah ... ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I will tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or apt I took some a swing city one takes some ground or as a second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shootings so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration\nIs all the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often hum are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton urged instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen\nI mean we we'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to blame the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is the the year where frankly president\nTrump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting\nWhat this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that thirty five forty years later the media looks back on a regular you know lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point but thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace\nPresident in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies tax cuts that are ... the economy for decades in the United prosperity\nAnd rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges from the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair\nOr it would be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I only have two minutes and you're like you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American to pay taxes got a break\nEvery American who pays taxes has a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are now manufacturing stuff here again or promising yes\nJust started doing it so the other side Devin seem all that success as\nWe've got we've got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas are manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas\nAnd and and and in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent um uh for the entire year here because of an more good news again this morning in the third quarter that three and a half percent growth beat\nPredictions inflation's down very strong consumer confidence and what that means\nIs America's growth will end up above ... percent this year just blowing path all the protections before our new tax code and tax cuts so the tax law this new tax law is working for millions of America\nIt really is a ... and also by the way getting rid of the individual mandate helped out a bit of an eighty percent you only talked about his eighty percent of those who are taxed\nBecause of the individual mandate we're we're in the middle class or lower middle class area they'll get a tax break when that went away is Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair of the president last week or a few days ago said I\nGot another big tax cut coming going to go to middle class families is going to be a big tax cut it's coming it's on the way you and I have talked about two point oh what does this look like and you can you let us in a little bit yeah so\nIt's really this one's a little ... to put in a two point oh it was really about you know tax forms about changing the trajectory of the economy\nAnd putting America back into the lead role that succeeded two point oh it was about changing the culture in Washington so that every year we make the tax code better more competitive so that means permanence for families and small businesses that that's fair\nThat their tax cuts are made permanent plus crates another million half new jobs\nThe second part of two when I was about to savings helping families say more in earlier for their life really important the third is about helping start a business as an innovation dropped back to America that's two point oh it's passed the house already and actually even picked up forty four democratic votes in the process\nBut this president wants to go beyond that like Ronald Reagan just as you enter as you said earlier\nWe have tried to every stage of life safer ... flashed the right seat that's safer ... the right seat a message from the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\nThe horses that have a story on MORNING news maybe not\nThat great values the weekend when Joe packs for stopping by [noise] what's\nGoing on lots to get to any is one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty one hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero many more um interviews to go to your phone calls as well we will have 'em\nAs we continue we're gonna have John Hi Beau shown he's gonna be the bottom of next hour he is the executive director of the the Reagan Institute out in California great conversation comparing the media and how he treated Reagan and how he acted back to them with how\nThe current president President Trump is acting toward the media also ... will be off the top of the hour\nYup the former communications director for president Donald Trump\nWhat the hell happened there even only on the job for a living days will have that for you to write none of the phone lines so let me say a little welcome to align one each Lisa in California I Lisa\nHi how are you living the dream which I Would have\nBeen calling um I actually ties into what the last caller was talking about\nUm went shooting how how would you get that churches typically forget I mean there are a whole nother story in movie theaters and other other churches typically\nHow would you get church hey action sort out the bad guys again and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy yeah and\nI certainly when I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility right not only protect myself but anybody that might that might come under attack against the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a churches\nBut that that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas do allow to in many places but at the same time they're also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to if you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that if you're not going to allow me to carry my going in\nAnd you should but if you're not going to allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun you want to to get a license for it you go on to the classes\nFor a and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area\nBecause they all allowed people to carry guns\nBut once we interviewed attack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their\nTwelve people died so I think that you have to work in conjunction with the synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing\nThey don't or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance an exit this way anybody getting an are getting out or anybody good a good mood to be an emergency I get on the other side to get out but everybody getting into that facility and they want to cause harm\nYou're gonna you're gonna identify them where we could pull the trigger one darn\nSure I mean I guess if they can do it they land they can certainly do it at a church\nWill be will be doing it move in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House social but people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives\nOr a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House you can't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play than like obviously the economic a full body scan for example or even a metal on you know those are the owner item then it's not just\nThat have an accent the people around them and in a church probably qualified people that are going to be there anyway that kind of\nThing but then there's training and then right no I just feel like they're\n... it like I said it's not just I don't agree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost and more I think that it's not a realistic I ...\nI I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you do a welcome to carry by guys like you and me congregation members that people know that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like but also you you just have a ... system where you have to be close to ... to ...

the blaze radio network a lot of you listening there and I appreciate you every single time\nIt is your boy Joe packs a note about ... before I go to John I Bush a couple of things are important number one when you go and do a radio show 'em you can't both be heard at the same time so when you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you got stopped for a second and then I'll let you continue but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would win if she kept talking unfortunately for you\nI have the microphone and I have control of of what's being heard at any given time now I have a decision to make either both of us speak at the same time and my listeners here either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking\nUm it's not going to be both ways though I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue but if you're gonna make allegation after an allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to ... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true\nIn fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's ... that's just not true um the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very fine people he didn't say that when he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides there are very find people on both sides\nThat if they were talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues of Confederate a war heroes of soldiers or leaders\nThat's what it was about cause they're tearing down people are tearing down monuments because they feel like they can\nAnd they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yeah\nAre they are good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people and I said absolutely so he's been he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and\nAnd the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on you actually believe that he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest\nThat he is and this whole thing about how we mocked a disabled reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms worry I guess he I don't know what the ... with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks as have stay like that that he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands in his in his forms as as most people do\nAnd the president went to I guess the guy wrote something bad or report or something bad about or negative about the president and he said do look at me better than any any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know spoken to in a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking him that way and be\nVery good of you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even consider running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo is he ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was he Claire boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do a report until two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not\nSometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he doesn't have that way and he speaks that way do look at me and double trouble um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're gonna do your own research and independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and we're not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker with the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide know squat and I'm angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact at the end of the day no more than I Do but you failed in any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level with anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll when the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces I gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what my politics work so bring it next time I get Angela but you better bring it better than that\nAll right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate sharia\nI'm just great when you\nHave really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll look wonderful but that thing behind you just got my attention or it appears to be a plane of some sort and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nWhile we're right here at the Reagan Library that are at fourteen Jen is one of the famous jets that\nLittle off the carrier or a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty\nDo remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan\nThat watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under control doesn't it\nYeah it sure did I mean but often came to the take home now are the retinas history Ronald Reagan was mostly festival presidents than us some\n... here and it's a great little listeners the run up to you know an academic cockpit it's a it's a great addition to the library\nWas ... if you can move to your left though actually move your right just for a second to actually see the plane I Want to show people that that in the oh that's beautiful looking at\n... nice All right I'm going to be the director and ask you to move back but that was it wasn't really excellent one of the people watching to see that's that's cool All right I Want to talk about that the Libyan crisis for a second the president then Ronald Reagan really I I was very engaged in politics that won't even though I was pretty young those Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old um but but you really grabbed her attention because\nOf the way that he dealt with crises um she might have dealt with crisis the same way that Donald Trump would but he would do in a very different way wouldn't it\nYeah you know I I've heard Trump often use the expression peace through strength you know that was Reagan's uh blind and uh I I find it fascinating to see a President Trump the day after day he seemed to take\nOne page after another from the Reagan play both but you're absolutely right the race in America than strong during the Reagan years just because of rape distance on\nHad written dramatically different styles that same same conservative philosophy\nIt's very interesting it's John Hi Beau she's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute a really appreciate the time it's interesting to watch because when President Reagan look there were people in the left who couldn't stand him either\nThe media went after him all the time but the way that he was very very different um back\nThen I remember the left in the right in this country all saying well oh hell yeah Gadhafi is a bad guy yeah we have to go and get the bad guy if Trump says somebody's a bad guy the left knee jerk reaction is that he's racist these ... in the blink is was it the way that Reagan dealt with with delivering the message is that why", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "city": "Omaha", "day": "28"}
