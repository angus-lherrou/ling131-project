{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "The first date when you can normally take it is that sixty to the last date that you want to take it by because if you don't then you just lose the benefit 'til you turn it on that is eight Seventy so there's an eight year\nTime segment and then there's a a benefit in the middle called full retirement age so if you're born between Nineteen uh uh forty three and Nineteen fifty for\nYour full retirement age is sixty six [noise] if you if you're born in fifty five like I was I'm sixty three I was born in fifty five mind sixty six years in two months and that goes\nWay up to two if you're born Nineteen sixty year later your full retirement age of sixty seven so basically everyone now has a full retirement age\nThat that's getting into retirement between sixty six sixty seven so going back to this question should I wait or not if you take earlier than full retirement age you get a reduction\nIn your Social Security benefit you get it earlier\nBut you get a reduction for life if you wait longer than full retirement age you get get it now but once you turn it on you'll have more for the rest of your life go look at what what's your health like you know kind of what the DNA within your family struggling or like I mean that people living in la long yeah yeah yes it is or you know what\nIf you turn it on because you really have to have the money now\nAnd that's your really your your your primary income stream or only interesting yeah there definitely turn on but most of the people I talk with they have some options something else that I think is important is is is the type of assets\nThat could be pulling it income from your retirement plans or ... or or savings or investments or the types of in other interests me do you have a pension\nYou know do you have some annuity income coming in you know is there is something that has a steady stream yeah you need to ask yourself and then basically I always say because it's true Social Security is usually the most flexible benefit or you can decide when to turn it on\nAnd and don't forget this is that there is that if you're married that survivor benefit ... if if if if you're the styles that has the higher earning say it's the man he has a higher earning benefit what happens is most men die before their wives die if you're in your\nLate fifties sixties yeah what happens is lots of times\nThe the the ... male is maybe two or three years older than the female and marriage well like my dad my dad died in eighty two I was Thirteen Years ago my mom's Ninety five and she's still living but she gets to jump to my dad's higher benefits so\nThat could play a part I like when people come in and say I did all the break even and and I have to live to eighty eighty years in three months\nTo make it worthwhile for me to to to hold off on a lame I benefit grow taking a later I say have you considered your your spouse if you die first and she jumps up to that Ira benefit\nNo no I didn't do that that's what the software does and we have software Lebanon page an analysis that does a great job of talking about when is your best time for you\nOn a year's financial circumstances to start taking the Social Security benefits one\nOf the things I find interesting is that there's there's nothing in it when it comes to to Social Security right I mean that you're just doing that to help folks put together a larger plan to to get to and through retirement right I mean there's there's nothing in it for you other than just helping folks out\nYeah that's a good point Steve and we don't charge anything if there's no cost there is no obligation but Social Security place it's a vital role and not not all advisors affect the majority advisors don't really understand all the ins and outs of Social Security claiming and we've got very good software\n[noise] we we we kind of rent that dearly to be able to help our clients but it really gives you some great color graphs that gives you an excel spreadsheet of when to take in and it had how the benefits come in especially if there's a married couple so\nWe're we're we're we know that it plays a key part within the income stream of all most of the ... the majority of Americans\nAbsolutely well Dave I'll tell you what I think a again piqued our interest in terms of getting in and let's let's

Trump on all things that you would imagine we talked about Eric I appreciate Joe are you a pact or you\nKnow I'm living the dream but it's it's going great today I'm ... and we've got a big debate when I was you know it's gonna be Ted Cruz speaking on a Robert ... going in so ... for some reason I'm not sure why but that's going to happen and said it's only ... tonight in that race is probably not as close as the media's pretending but we really can't take it for granted right\n[noise] let's see they gave her thing for granted people have to go out and they have to vote and the the amount you hear people say to me what my guy guys Trump is on the you know and he's on the ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nGo as a country we're winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is on fire it's four point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in the history of our nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years you know we have the\nLargest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing is coming back to our nation for one case or through the roof of small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes and they were\nA year ago which is just created start chip you know financial engine\nUm I mean we are doing so incredible that's before you start talking about you know president for and what you need to be done you opioid crisis taking on a Supreme Court justices and prescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs\nYou know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm you know no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now is you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right oh well America's strongest economy that's ever hatch who's winning this thing right and\nAnd that's what he promised the American people he was going to do he promised the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get get used to be used to the country and but people have to get out there they have to get out and vote\nIt's Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right but as I watch these races it's very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country you remove all the advertising you're saying oh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate friends\nThe top one percent of the vast majority of the tax cut everybody else got nothing that's alive that's not true everybody who pays taxes got tax cuts and corporations will employers got tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the large when you see them around but\nHonestly they're truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty of politics again this is this in a world where people were not we we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world these people were truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean\nYou look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or you know dozens and dozens of millions of small businesses right all across\nOur nation their get their pay Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he flashed regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... you have the lowest Hispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history\nThe lowest female unemployment in the history I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\nDo you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with with China where if you set a product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five to fifty percent and terrorists right where they can make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge 'em anything so I mean\nWho do you think's gonna win that battle I mean it is absolutely unbelievably well we we over tax companies we over regulated companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre are they the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it\nIt's going through the roof are they the\nStock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception or some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K.\nYou know where every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases\nBullied me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nThat it's Eric Trump the son of president Donald Trump also trumpeter national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people up those or give us raises millions more people go ... a small businesses are adding\nEmployees instead of flushing the with Obama you're alone they slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada's said no way we're going to do it then they made a deal Mexico said no way we're gonna do it than they made a deal do you use it in a way we're going to do with the maybe the deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the back and how we're doing well\nHow about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world you know those people to keep your doctor\nYou're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know flew through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um legislation that road has drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs you you you look at a right to try you look at so many of these different efforts and\nYou know that's right because you know the politicians had been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives and then they don't care about actually governing\nThey just want to keep themselves elected so their sales people that's who he is I mean he's he's the one guy who's probably ever come into government who had the worst of life you know then then\nBefore he ... and that's usually I I\nThink he needed this job ... had he had the greatest life in the world he can only mean he was paid me the American dream them you know maybe still isn't so many ways\nHe didn't need the headache he didn't need the aggravation but he would open up the papers every single day and you'd see\nAmerica give us a hundred and fifty billion dollars to Iran a country that absolutely hate our guts right you know instead of spending it on a you know our inner cities or educational systems or our military right that had fighter jets where they were going to museums to borrow parts because they didn't have enough parts for our our ... I mean it's\nCrazy this is this is yet we're giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to a country that would love to see is wiped off the face of the earth\nAnd that's shaking his head jail I see him shaking his head saying what are we doing as a nation are these people absolutely insane and they were and look how much he's accomplished in two years I mean look what he's accomplished a two year period of time it's unbelievable\nIt's a it's Eric Trump Trump International also the son of course with the president of a president Donald Trump or in watching the midterms approach\nIt didn't look great for Republicans in fact it looked like the house is going to be easy win for the so called blue wave and the Senate was was was right on the border now it looks like we'll probably gain three or four senators promoted people do and vote and the house was up for grabs again\nI think that's got to be with Kavanaugh effect you've got to be that we were re motivated re energized on the right in traditional American values people by watching the lengths to the left\nWould go to do you think that can last another two or three weeks or are we still okay there we\nHave to keep on energizing people\nWell and you always have to energize people and people have to realize how important their vote is you have to get out you know if you believe in ... you have to get out you have to though I mean it's just that simple even if he's not in the valley you have to get\nOut early use about him that wasn't a nerd it really ...\nOf course it is of course it is because he doesn't have sent if he doesn't have the house it makes a lot tougher to get you know various things through and you know\nThe cabinet and they look at it you know ... I mean whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty right at ... the Democrats we like it to me the exact opposite way only because it worked for them that specific day they want somebody be guilty until proven innocent I mean they tried to destroy somebody's family but it but aside from\nIn the u._k. where he would receive one dollar in a one percent royalty on all of his recording us jump ahead to Nineteen eighty where for the first time ever London's legendary happy road studios auctions off thousands of dollars a quip men including some used on Beatles recordings\nThis week in Nineteen eighty eight find Julie starts to run it number one on the U.S album chart their fourth release New Jersey the album pretty surprised billboard hot one hundred and ten single for the most top ten has to do hard rock album\nThis week\nIn Nineteen Ninety One red hot chili peppers kick off their blood sugar sex magic tour where they show in Madison, Wisconsin they're opening acts are smashing pumpkins and a new band called Pearl Jam and this week in twenty fourteen\nYou two front man ... said he was sorry after their latest album was automatically added to the library's them all I can users\nAround the world saying the move was a drop of megalomaniac and touch of generosity I can users complained that the eleventh songs that they added to their music library without permission and that it was not clear how to delete them it was a rare stumble for Apple and YouTube\nThere's you're back\nThey're both aerobic caught external prosper\nDisasters don't plan a hand but you can talk to your loved ones about making an emergency plan getting started today and ready dot Gov slash plan to you by the ... and the ad council fewer city or world\nYour voice the station you can trust ... days in a news radio Lebanon tin can they be shown shelling\nAnd body to join the hospital on line this Friday night lights on this lady on the\nValues that we do have\nFive zero one seven zero eight zero\nOne eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty Glenn ambulance to the right also J.

or but it also has to come down to these policies you know we had the catch and release policy and then we have the know charged up which you know I absolutely what we should be doing\nOr what Trump said earlier on the spot on every which way I can buy them one hundred percent but my question is\nWhy are these policies overriding laws we had this Chechen release policy for years and nine eleven that ate the Jewish or got are the Mexican border and they weren't stopped because of a policy that we have a place it started at Nineteen Ninety three\nOh we had the world Trade Center jak most a

forecast\nWhat was your knee jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty who's your who's your thought process what it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take this stuff\nAnd he actually that all of them down and said I Want to do this and then two days before the famous athlete or a day during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after\nAll of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise up\nBut but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew\nThat my father in law can do this job he's a businessman the is so smart when it comes to negotiating the one who's been able to do in in so many different respect what Tara with trade um he's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this from ... it's it's it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we can take a couple of planes going on here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because\nI really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest president the country's ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty sixteen or because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the electric come after you guys but not like this and I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they were trying to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but\nI had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty and forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper or on their television or radio show so he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday lean left\nBut I didn't know was going to be like this so what what was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and I ...\nIt became very frustrating for me to to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things and and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there\nFor for forever if you know he became president ... but um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn\nChild I mean it's the talk about it is a it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before the Trump became president that if he got in there there was no turning back and he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life is going to come to an end so\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that you do in a great jobs\nI Would agree with you you guys were you ever ... have any family you've ever seen in my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband and father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything most people don't vote\nIn Texas where I should you've got to cruise the incumbent who's doing an incredible job in working with your with your brother in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being challenged from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan we're ... been there for three decades\nAnd it's time for her to go now when you got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get that show that Israel's seat this really use gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the reruns and go vote for him is really what it is is it\nOh absolutely well as I speak to you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will\nBe onto your day ironically in Michigan um this is so so important we we know that the president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people in his own party sometimes money and get them to think about\nIt could happen if he had to coach the people behind him that voted along side\nPresident and and really pushing the younger forward we can do much more progress and the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social and them look like look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward\nReally very frightening socialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are and breaking people like that since shock everybody to agree that you know not only are going to get out and get in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go about\nIt it's very area and I know that it felt like a fight and twenty they seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly what the fight isn't over you you can't get back we can't relax we can't be complacent me to get out and got to vote and put people in Congress and we're going to vote with the president\nIf if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to them in their shoes are delicious loses wife who's from Venezuela who\nTells the stories of how disgusting it is there I mean there are people waiting in line for food and the government officials will show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in the country it is horrific and you really do have people in this country or cause you a court shows\n... you've got people who were actually saying this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go lower last question I really appreciate your time and by the way I'm Glad you're in Minnesota we go for great stations there we were very highly rated in Minneapolis the polling Katie okay they're hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts and take more of your money away at will drive jobs out of the country that's\nWhat they are running on and the fact is there almost fifty fifty right now in almost every poll you see what is it that we're doing wrong you and I ... I done junior the president the Fox news Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that is crazy to me\nWell I don't know that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the old weren't\nSure and a great point I\nDon't really think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid\nTo tell a pollster that call them or coaches them on the street\nThat they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood has done such a number on on people whenever they come out in support of the president or as a Republican I'm no I think it does make people a little hesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth\nWhenever no one else is looking when they think about the ... where we come in this country and almost elected in two years under President Donald Trump through and they think about their children in the future of the country I really think that they're going to vote Republican and um it's just a matter of getting people out and encouraging people to get out and vote\nFalling here knocked or make phone calls everybody you know to go vote\nYou know I'm On the road from now until November that\nI have a Thirteen month old son believe me I Would love home hanging out with him but because of him and because I Want the future to be the best they can be perhaps I'm Out here doing this and the most important thing I could be doing\nAnd that's when beautiful baby congratulations on his birthday recently the pictures of lived over on on Instagram are amazing things are much lower for taking the time was talk again very soon can we\nOh I Would love that data thank\nYou and it it is a really great to have the daughter in law of the president of the United states that's Lara Trump shoes ... wife and she's on the campaign stuff as well as everybody else do I mean they're they're out there trying to get it done\nThey're out there trying to get it done to get the message out there and I just saw a news story about the uh the number of people who've signed up to go to this rally in Houston on Monday\nAnd it's going to blow your mind when they tell you the number when we come back to your phone calls or give you a bit on that it's um eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero Joe ... dot coms there either\nFixing a roles

you think about it health care providers typically you don't think about us until you're scared and injured insect this for us kids it's not too early to continue to advance our mission which is about creating health in our community in different ways\nBut you know the other thing for us that was important as we\nThrough the process of deciding whether or not this was something we wanted to pursue\nWas that we were actually contributing to the city the money that we pay for this agreement not only allows the city to avoid having to packs a it's taxpayers or should there be shortfalls but also provides resources to the city to continue to upgrade and improve what I Believe is a\nRound tool not only of the of the city of Omaha but of the reason\nIt's unique there as far as I Know there's no other health system like ours that has this kind of relationship but I Believe that it's also great to the community it's by far on and say\nWhat are some of the things that maybe people wouldn't think that the HI health is involved in in the community stock probably are are most visible community benefit is that we provide\nCare to those are the most unfortunate in our community those that have the least resources those that don't have good insurance to cover all the costs them the care they need so that is the thing that's always top on our list that as part of our mission which is to serve everyone in the community with particular focus on those that\nAre most in need we have now over four thousand different individuals that have participated from I think a hundred and Seventy different organizations specifically around the topic of behavioral health and we do that 'cause it is so important in the community and it's part of our mission\nAnother CEO use you know thing for me you know more of a community and thank you were listening to this diehard Omaha radio station\n\nWhich is like the newsletter inside place I [noise]\nWhen when he was stations across the

about how hard it was to raise money for the movie plus of course we have to talk\nPocahontas we have to talk to midterms Michelle I appreciate you how are you\nGood how are you doing I'm doing great ... listen thanks for taking the time I Want to jump into the gods no movie a which sort of piqued my interest the other day that's why I reached out to you but I Can't not start with Elizabeth Warren it turns out is one one thousand twenty four\nNative American so I'm Out in the left media the show now says she's basically like a a Cherokee queen I mean that's right what am I missing here\nShe has been vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never\nFlabbergasted by lengths to which identity politics left will go to\nTry and unwind blatant advanced her career manufacturing a Native American ancestry and it is indeed found\nOver and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was\nIntense that by releasing their results showed that she\nPossibly had Native American ancestry six to ten generation back yeah\nThat that was based on a proxy Native American right and in other words the researcher South American genetic markers of estimation for whether or not she really at this\nAncestry come on\nSomeone who identified as a woman of color right in order to get I mean like\nIn a very real way Rachel Dole is all about as black is this woman is Native American and you're right that they're using like minor as tech they're hoping they're praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words she's wider than I'll ever be\nAnd in fact by statistics that were quoted and none other than New York\nTime it turns out that this one thousand one one one thousand twenty fourth fraction of a possible Native American bloodline makes makes her ... less\nThan it did it in other words than the average white American more Native American ancestry than she does\nA hundred percent but you're absolutely right about that in the Boston Globe tried to say that she was one thirty second at the at the most and one one thousand twenty four at the least they even had to update that four hours later to say okay maybe one sixty four at the most\nWhich was an I'm Italian I'm English I'm polish and Irish or you know these things and I'm I'm I'm actually you know about\nBirds Italian the snow falls into place I have no clue but one one thousand six before anything else and nobody can ever we I don't think you'd never really find that out but they have one tiny little marker on one time ... scale amazing Trump's you don't need a million dollars and apologized or help me understand\nYeah yeah you know the the rich irony in a serious point is that this week I'm a very important cases being litigated by legitimate Asian American students have um suit Harvard University which awarded\nElizabeth Warren this a position as a as a professor right because of her fake claim and those Asian American students have on earth do all sorts of admissions\nDocuments showing that they were discriminated because they were Asian American and there were too many of them in the university system and it just goes to show you that you know the the ... the Olympics of grievance and the Olympics of identity politics brings us exactly to the to this point in time and it and it's\nAnd it and I think so many people are sick and tired of it I mean for the twenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote of color\nAnd yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama I've had all of these\nWhite progressive left is shouting at me that I'm not really my ethnicity because of my beliefs\nAnd that to me really is is the real offense here of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color that they're not people of color while they're bracing phony like Rachel ... and Elizabeth Warren\nIn Peru shown getting in there as well eat so yes ... I'm ... read her blog on what you do you see every machine does you're going to reduce showing your TV was used at noon incredible investigative reporting um I wanted to tell you about this does know movie I didn't know what your attachment was doing turns out it was really hard to\nRaise money for this movie it's basically a movie about\nWhat it's actually called the trial of America's biggest serial killer I Believe this guy was America's biggest serial killer one show so much trouble to make obviously a very interesting um ... million born story\nWell ah the bottom line is that the a radical abortion is in the Democratic party and on the left\nI Do not want to acknowledge the horrors that are committed in the name of so called reproductive choice and my attachment to the movie into the story goes back to two thousand eleven when almost nobody else was paying attention to the story and I first blogged about the grand jury report\n'em in the indictments against Kermit gods now who murdered multiple born alive babies as well as being responsible for the death of a woman in in his clinic\nI'm back in ... eleven\nAh what was stunning about this grand jury report that was issued in you know Democrat liberal Philadelphia or was that they acknowledged that time and time and again government agencies as well as women's advocates looked the other way at the blatant\nCereal crimes that were going on I'm essentially out in the open and so when an ... and feel I'm ...\nI decided that they were going to first write an investigative book\nAbout uh the crimes and then turn them into a movie I volunteered to use my platform any way that I could to help them and initially they tried to crowdsource the movie on\nA Kickstarter and were kicked off by pro abortion sensors on that website they had to go to Andy go go and I donated personally three times to the movie and so did many thousands and thousands of other small donors rated to point three million dollars to get this movie made and it\nEnded up in the top ten of movies this weekend despite a campaign to to shut up any kind of publicity for the movie\nAnd again it's ... dot com boom she was ... trial of America's biggest serial killer was showing all said grumble raising money on Facebook and how about advertising on on the NPR I mean there was a ... everywhere\nEverywhere that's right Facebook up a block them from putting promoted ads on an NPR refused to to run an ad that told the truth about\nHouse now there's always a speech in contrast this day's news radio eleven ten K.

don't think you'll hear me where you are a thing that I went to I wanted\nTo hear your debit yet they be good but they they run the show a little bit delayed which is fine uh there is no doubt in my mind that that we can't know whether these people are healthy or not we can't know if they're bringing diseases we can't that's why we have the legal process by which people can come here\nBut I think that she hung up I just I just don't aren't going to not just tell her that she can't hear it because they run it in an hour a bind\nHave told me that I I tried to stay stable and either way a Victorian it's a good question and we don't know and certainly it is a health issue for our country and for people and when you bring that up you would think that the you know be\nTolerant loving caring sympathetic left would say oh that's right we should look out for our children we have to understand it's not really about anybody here it's about people who are coming here\nBecause the left

... disease a Republican former congressman break state of Florida running for governor of Florida Rick Scott is running for Senate he was the governor is the governor now\nAnd the ... the Democrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist a run I appreciate you how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing I'm living the dream and really glad to have your own it would be a it would be bad of me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to the people fill my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really why I mean we Todd I'm born and raised in Florida and we've seen a lot of storms all the young one and\nTwo homes better Ninety to buy into the worst damage I've seen in terms of Panama Sandy and in terms of Mexico beach in some of the area and so I'm a I'm a self servants rising was turn away out um they're starting to get power back a\n\nLot of structural damage because you had basically about category I\nHad um I talked to some of the sheriff's they're um they're actually progressing had a scheduling which is good I thank God\nYou know one of the threat neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the end but today it's supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's just certain amount of damage that we're going to have a you know at that\nAge secondary obviously we are talking to run to see it as former congressman he's a Republican running for governor of Florida gives leader Gillum um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that voting might be an issue it might\nBe not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast I'm going to be out ... getting to handle is that getting taking care of who's working on that\nIt is said there's a the governor's working on that come in the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations for the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people are still in the county hot but I think you're looking at an additional polling location and then I think there's going to be a some consideration for if you are displaced or you can\nVote and other counties and your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that\nAnd by saying that that's something that's doable and\nI think that they well look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very Senate minded so I think a lot of them\nAre even though they got a lot of there's got to deal with I didn't know what I really appreciate Ivan Watson Cheney to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican run to see it as running for governor the great state of Florida run you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm good I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years and I love your id go back all the time my mom was there my sisters are there and I suddenly understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there's there was a sea change that happened\nSince I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern bureau Florida that it's very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center right or center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans um other Hispanics like Venezuelans\nAnd the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism they don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country uh we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country that had been in Congress\nThe elements hostile to Israel I mean the uh\nIs endorsed by a group that dream defenders\nWhich is prominent in the ... movement against Israel they say Israel genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great that is you don't want to pose it Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's\nA tunnel indivisible capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause a Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't this time they nominated Andrew\nGillum there's really align with the radical left a which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and it'd be government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants\nMedicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic or I've never met\nA Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that they that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic\nVoters not monolithic I mean in Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics\nIn South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California um and then of course in central Florida you know we've had a burgeoning population of people who are Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually endorsed by the sitting congresswoman from Puerto Rico\nOr who's a Republican and a friend of mine and so I think\nThe reason why Florida we're doing good because we're producing economic opportunity\nAs Republicans I mean we have the low is as follows the unemployment and the history\nOf our country it's hot and I think we can do even better in Florida you're not going to do\nThat though if you do what Gillum wants to do which is raise taxes forty percent a single payer health care you know on and on and does that would really be the end\nOf Florida's economic momentum so I think a lot of these folks really across the border looking at it and say you know I Want to be able to have a good job I'm going to be able if I work hard to be able to get ahead well clearly if that's what you're looking to do and I'm your guy because I'm going to build apartments success Florida has has had economically I Am not going to tear down\nWith can Fisk tore tax policy\nIt's a run run as soon as he used a Republican running for governor the great state of Florida former congressman from down there but let me talk specifically about school school safety you know that I'm a good friend of a republic well of course tragically lost his daughter meadow in Parkland, Florida and I missed the high school in February fourteenth that area of the state was put on the international map\nAs ground zero of gun control versus you know armed guards at the schools um you've got people on school boards like this guy Runcie who is a promise program Obama guy who will ignore the the violent criminal history of students just said that they don't have a a record when they get out of school for some reason\nOr what can you do should you become the governor I Hope you will become a governor think you're gonna but what can you do from that offers from a position\nTo stop allowing sheriff's like Israel to turn a blind eye to a bad guy who could walk on campus and kill a bunch of people to get people off school boards like ... who is going to ignore criminal records of people like this Eighteen Nineteen fifty three fifty eight I don't see his name I see his his", "show_name":
