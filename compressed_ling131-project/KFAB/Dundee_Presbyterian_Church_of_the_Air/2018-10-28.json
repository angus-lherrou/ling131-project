you every Sunday by the members of the church and are generous listeners speaker for church of the air today as Mr Keith [noise]\nDirector of children and family ministry on your announcer is our kind of\nA\nOh\n\nScripture reading this morning by a member of the congregation\nThe Old Testament reading for this morning is jokes thirty eight one through seven\nListen for the word of God\nThen the lord answered job out of the whirlwind who is this dark and counsel by words without knowledge good your lawyer is like a man I Will question you and you shall declare to me\nWhere were you when I laid the foundation of the ear tell me if you have understanding who determine its measurements surely you know or\nWho stretch the line upon it on what worries basis son or her latest cornerstone when the morning star staying together and all the heavenly being shouted for joy\nThe New Testament reading for this morning as founding mark ten versus thirty five to forty five let's sit in front of word of God James and John\nThe sons that that many came forward to him and said to him teacher we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you and he said to them what is that you want me to do for you\nAnd they said to him [noise] granted us dissent one at your right hand and wanted she left in your glory but Jesus said to them you do not know what you were asking\nYou able to drink a cup that I drink or be baptized with the bad to them that I Am baptized where they replied we're able\nThan Jesus said to them the cops that I drink you will during and with the bad kids them with which I Am baptized you will be baptized but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mind to grant but it is for those who made it has been prepared\nWhen the ten heard this they began to be angry with James and John\nSo Jesus called them and said to them you know that among the gentile those whom they recognize their rulers lord it over them and they're great ones are tyrants over them\nBut it is not so among you and whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you must be flame of all but the Senate man came not to be served but to search and to give his life a ransom for many\nThis is the word of God for the people of God thanks be to God\nAnd now Mr Holmes message for today\nToday we are going to cover as the name of the message those who do we think we are and it really it struck me this week 'cause I was studying this and and it came back to me a horrible horrible memory that I have\nI was a senior in college and I'd gotten a lead role in a play I have a theater or speech communication degree and I was big in the theater department as a matter of fact I went to a very small\nSmall small\nLiberal arts college but there I was in our theater department in a play and I was a senior so since pretty much my sophomore year I'd been getting lead roles and I'd been getting bigger\nAnd bigger and bigger and puffy here and puffy here in my head was getting bigger and bigger and\nBigger until I started what is called backstage\nDirecting\nWhere are you as an actor backstage to the other actors start telling them what you think they should do\nNo matter what the directors telling them to do and I was probably on stage directing I Would stop and say to the director will wait what if you had them do this\nAnd and these things and so finally one day the director called me into his office and and sat me down and now I got to admit\nI thought oh this is going to be a nice special one on one time where we'll get a chance to share as equals some of the things I'd been thinking about and helping him he would tell me how great it was to have me as part of his cat\nWell imagine then my surprise when he began to land base to me\nAnd tell me that he had the phone number of two people in his address book that he could simply call that day and offer the park to\nThat very day he said it kinda depends on how this conversation is going to go because I'm ready to call them right now I Am so sick of you\nDoing what you're doing\nWell needless to say that was very humbling\nWell humiliating and very eye opening for me I had become so big in my own head that I thought I\nWas more important than the director of the show\nThe one who created this one that was creating division for the one who put things in place\nAnd had a vision for what the show was going to be like here I was in stealing in in putting my vision on top of that\nWell I left that office very humbled\nAnd from then on behave myself very well\nAnd so we see a little bit about that\nHow that's going to look like today\nJesus talks to the brothers in when God talks\nJoe I always hear my director\nIn my head when these words come out from that day so we're going to start with job and then move on to those sons of thunder James and John and job thirty one\nThe three friends of job had been telling him all about his sin and the previous chapters we know that Joe was sitting on a mound of ashes open sores and he was not doing well\nAnd his friends had all been telling him it was obviously some on confess send that he had that had caused God's treat him this way\nAnd so then in thirty one he reacts to that saying then let God tell me himself\nIf I have not been thinking of others if I Am not taking care of the poor if I have not been using my wealth and the things that he's given me for this let him come down and in thirty one thirty five he goes as far as to say that I had one day here me\nHere is my signature meaning that he had listed out the indictment and he signed it saying if this is it eyesight it now\nTell me what the almighty answer me\nHe was at a breaking point he wanted answers not from his friends now from his wife who told him ... Scott and die\nNot from any one bus from God himself he demanded it\nSo then by the time we get the chapter thirty eight\nWe've had a lot of speculating by job's friend this is those chapters of where ... who started being all puffed up and saying listen to me the voice that God has chosen to say to you and still ... who got it wrong\nSo then when we get to a chapter thirty eight there's another storm\nThe first or and we see in job is the one that took the lives of his children\nAnd now God comes to them again in the storm and speaks out of that storm and tells him\nSome awful awful\nTruth God responds to a job\nWith the questions of his own and these questions point out\nThat God is in control\nNow before we get to them I wanted also go back and talk real briefly about its in thirty eight to when he says gird your ... like a man\nThis this passage a lot of commentators that I've read this week have said this is an amazing passage because once I'm bound to happen is a slam basically got his slamming man job in particular\nBut it's at this moment we see something very important God says gr your ... like a man and I will ask you questions\nGod\nIs meeting God is taking the meeting\nHe's not saying shut up and do what I tell you a job\nAnd not answering the questions\nHe's not an theory oh God that wouldn't have answered because he wasn't real he wasn't a made up God of those local religions but God even though Joe had no right had no reason\nDemanded and God still answered him God answers when we cry out", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dundee Presbyterian Church of the Air", "city": "Omaha", "day": "28"}
