Jonah says\nTo us about God about gods about God's Grace if you'll recall God called Jonah to preach grace\nTo preach law to preach particularly for the ... for ... for a sin to the people in the middle of a they hated\nEnemies of the people and God the people who knew or were horrible rebellious people against God's ways\nThey care nothing for God at all and yet God wanted to send Jonah to speak to them about ... years and Paul them to Rip Patton so that they may be prepared\nTo receive the kingdom of God and be in a relationship with God and Jonah did not want to go because Jonah didn't want them here and decided that they were\nAll people\nHe decided that they will was so he went in exactly the opposite direction that's where the fish part comes in [noise]\n... came along and said Jonah on the right way and he indeed finally grudgingly obeyed God and preach the kingdom and preached rip it to the people of none of us and to his surprise he repented better than\nAnyone Jonah became the most successful profit of all time\nWhen people listen to what he had to save a repented\nAnd in God relented relented\nIn his plan to destroy the city of none of us got acted in mercy and in gray\nAnd Jonah reacted with anger Jonah pouch [laughter]\nI can just see him sitting there pouting away he got angry\nNot ... not at the people not of a city that he had decided was not worthy of the love of God he got mad at God he got mad at God because God he's gracious he said that himself by mad at\nYou God because I knew I knew it would be merciful I knew you'd be\nGracious\nHe was mad and God for loving the very people the very group of people that will join us hated most I'm angry at you God because you have a ... D with grace that's the message\nThat the other side we saying amazing grace how sweet the sound and we are right to do so and then the book of Jonah reminds us that in addition to being amazing\nGod's Grace is also very\nOffensive and then we go to church and then we worship God and then\nWe make our offerings to God God's Grace is amazing it's amazing when God's\nGrace forgives me God's Grace is amazing when he gives me new life when it renews me when it reconciled me to God God's Grace is offensive when it does the same thing with an individual or with a group of people\nThat I don't think deserve it and then we worship and we go to church\nAnd then we make our offerings and all that the way that we ... we\nPray the way that we give the way that we relate to others fear any in the world will tell the tale of how we really feel\n\nAbout the grace of God he's an amazing ... is the worst rejoicing in is it worth giving thanks to God for ... or is it a sense of and doesn't deserve nothing but a out from us\nWe see all\nOf that happening in Lucas chapter seven that had to read for us today it's a fantastic story\nWe're told that this man named Simon he's a fair the he has invited Jesus to come to dinner at his house we have no idea [noise]\nWe have no idea why Simon extended that invitation but we can gather that he's\nNot even half convinced of who this Jesus Says he's not tremendously impressive he wants to have 'em over to his house perhaps the grew him with questions or to track him and to reveal what a fool he is certainly other affairs sees\nCertainly other friends of his have tried to do that they gather around\nThe table and Jesus is there and then this woman comes uninvited she craft shows the party she decides that she has gotten more important things to do\nShe is heard the message of amazing grace in her ... amazing indeed for she is a center\nAnd she knows that but somewhere along the line she has gained in her knowledge of who Jesus Christ is she has heard the message of of the gospel of Jesus Christ she has heard at the message of repentance and the grace and she has been changed and nothing will stop her", "show_name": "Dundee Presbyterian Church of the Air", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "21"}
