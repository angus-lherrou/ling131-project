joined a gym called well and thank you so much for being with us today\nYou know we have a sense of talent show today here Jim and let's get back into it about you know we've been getting great news about the economy and yet the market didn't react so positively and use the word haywire maybe potentially and you know a lot of money I mean we're talking trillions of dollars can be lost and just a matter of days\nSo you're probably left one or it's a weekend or what should I Do you know ... position and protect your investments so coming up in the segment we're going to keep talking about sound in practical strategies\nYeah ... I Would say that it gets out and practical strategies on how to position\nAnd protect position to protect your investments in a turbulent stock market so let's just get right into a gym I've been enjoying sharing this with you and your insight here on the program here today um I Know you're an advisor across the network\nUm I'm a certified financial planner and as we talk about these things let's talk about ways to protect yourself and especially\nThose of you nearing or in retirement if we do have a downturn what should you do and here's some things so number one just spend a little more conservatively\nHate to say it but you know what I mean we don't need to go out to eat tonight or maybe um we don't need to do whatever it is too I Love\nAn income by matter I just think for a lot of people those are helpful you take away some of the risk of rising interest rates um and what you do there also figure out a way gym um to have a rising what\nWe call a glide path and equity so if if you don't have a lot in there or you're thinking about adding more there's a technique a lot of people use maybe you want to talk about what a DCA is er dollar cost averaging\nSure so great way to\nTo put money into a market if if especially when you have volatility dollar cost averaging as just a systematic investment plan so let's just say somewhat has a hundred thousand dollars and it's sitting at a checking account doing nothing\nThe ability to transfer on a regular basis X amount of dollars into one two three or four different strategies so you're going to buy when the market's down you might buy when it's up you might buy it between but you're going to average is\nOut of the end of the at the end of the time period great way to get into the markets\nYeah I mean I look at I mean I've used it in five twenty nine plans for my kids all these things I put a little bit in each month and now so let's imagine a you just got your third quarter bonus from your job\nAnd you're like oh my gosh what am I going to do with this money so I put in the market ooh this is mark it was scary this week I don't know what to do well maybe you take a little bit and say hey\nLet's put a little in this month low next month and set up apparently that way\nYou're taken emotion out of this decision you made just a good financial game plan decision on what to do\nHere is not a thing make sure you have a cash reserve or what we often just called your emergency fund\nThere so we have an ... or no way do you have enough in it that you pull some out of it to go into the market people do gym and we've seen in the air on the show and it certainly across our network all the time\nIf you did let this week be a warning sign to you you better maybe shifted back out of there and to make sure you got enough and ... there's nothing they could scares me more Jim and people who [noise]\nPaul from their safety net trying to stretch\nFor that extra income and what happens boom they don't make it\nA you know I like also use a golf analogy here is like knowing you've got a um a golf hole that your odds of making it are one out of ten or one out of twenty long power for yeah whatever they are and\nYou like to go for it because it's fun but what happens nine out of ten times disaster disaster don't let that happen\nTo you with not having enough and your emergency fund and the way you approach it\nSo now let's talk about okay how with this volatility back Jim ... be efficient with taxes guess guess what no one likes to pay taxes we all know that but if you're over the age of fifty five you're going to have more control over how much you pay in taxes\nThan any any other time in your life so I mean imagine is now and we have a downturn in the market and I just turned Seventy and I'm gonna have to take a required minimum distribution and that's going to come out of my account is now down ten percent or twenty percent\nDo I like that no no why\nWell it's the wrong time it's timing timing is everything yeah and and I think going back to that when you look at how we do things here you always have a little bit of money in cash in those type of accounts so that so that if you have to pull that are empty you could do it without upsetting the apple cart\nYeah and um there's so many things that you could miss here I mean I'm\nMe don't you don't want to pull it because you're worried that the stocks than you don't do it\nAnd you make a mistake I guess what fifty percent five zero percent penalty if you don't do this correctly um and I mean if the stock you life was that whatever fifty in because the down markets down to forty\nYou got us out if you don't have that cash available now your double ... now you got to sell it but guess what you're going to pay taxes are going to pay ordinary income if you're calling us money out of your area or four one K.\nThat's a problem so how do you combat that\nAgain if you are over fifty five you want to look at how do you have what we call tax diversification not even fifty five everybody really is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Wealth From Wisdom with Ron Carson", "city": "Omaha", "day": "13"}
