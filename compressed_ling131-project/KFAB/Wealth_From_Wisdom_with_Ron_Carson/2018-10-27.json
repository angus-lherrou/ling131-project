show and somebody who isn't that next generation of money and figuring out is they don't want any gotcha is when they grow up and they don't understand how all these things work and I think about when I first got in the workforce you know I had a lot of got just\nWow taxes and Social Security I thought it was making ... thousand dollars a year or the reality is you're not at all some other gotcha heck I remember when you first high ... you're not on the parents payroll anymore and you're done with high school and college and you go get\nAt first house you know like holy cow I Can't believe how much insurance costs holy cow I Can't believe I'm not going to pay electric and gas\nAnd all these things and they add up like crazy and you what you think is easy isn't easy with related the

all the upkeep and you have to stored in the winter if you're at a a climate changes so yeah you have to plan ahead for those things\nWhile they're fun I mean they're fun to own and so you have to balance are you okay is that is the piece in enjoyment and pleasure you get from all of those things are great\nAnd you know I think would be remiss if we didn't talk about this week I'm you know certainly these lotteries that have been going on and you know what should people do with their money or not\nAnd I won't forget I was down at the Nebraska game last weekend and someone was like well Paul what's your financial planning recommendation should I buy a mega millions ticket or Powerball tickets and\n... you know my answer back to them was absolutely and they're like really and they said is the worst financial decision I can make that's wherever else was telling me and I said I don't disagree from a financial perspective\nBut I completely disagree buying a lottery ticket brings people enjoyment it brings them hope\nIt brings them fun conversation so here's my example if you're going to go out you're going to meet someone for happy hour and you buy a beer or glass of wine or a soda or whatever it is\nWhat do you do when you're going there to have conversation sure right you're going to go and enjoy it but do you get your money back\nAfter you consume that glass of wine or those nachos or whatever you got it you're happy are no but you went and had fun I think about so many people I saw last week's has her again we're talking about the Powerball and how mega millions\nAnd I said look how much time we just spent twenty minutes about how much fun\nThings we had to talk about we know we're probably never ever going to win the likelihood is so small but there is a fun factor I call it a return on psyche something that you're able to enjoy so\nI don't I don't think you should go spend hundreds of dollars on a lottery ticket by any means but if you get pleasure out of it like the same way you do from drink a glass of wine or going out to dinner or your your latte\nThen be smart about it and enjoy it in a way that's helpful for you because you know

All right thank you have a lot of how you make that now there are so\nToday we're talking about retirement tax traps that could cost thousands of dollars for also learning\nInsight from every generation of investor and people what they learn about money and and their wealth and come out in the segment we're going to talk about a technique I'm really how do you convert to Iraq now that could really save you a lot of money in your in your retirement\nBut also there's so many other ways just to make quick ... quick tax avoidance techniques that are out there and like I said we've got cc she's a sophomore at home mum area and we're so glad to have er I mean and see some of the things that\nYou haven't probably learned yet about life and money um we'll talk about like how do parents or how to grandparents help pay for your education how do they help pay for your high school how do they help pay for your college\nThere's things that are out there called you know U. T. M. A. accounts and covered elves and five twenty nine plans and we can spend a lot of time on the show but I was just curious you know like\nYou know as you're sitting there you know you learn obviously from your parents from your siblings your your friends about money but did you get to spend any time in high school to high school teach you anything about money well\nNot yet has and that at my school they offered me a class that personal science class and they also offer a business in personal La Crosse that teaches\nYou about money oh that's a great idea I Love to hear that because I think I think it's important to earlier people start the better um and I think it's good so I Hope you take that class 'cause it sounds like a good one\nThe thing is it's not required that they're not as many people take it then they shed\nYeah actually may wish talk because I think it should be required for a lot of people I mean we've talked about this across the country\nIs the sooner people learn because people tend to be what we what we call Jim ... is people's tend to stay away from it and we don't want 'em to because it's money is the one of the most important topics we have we talked about relationships that people get married\nWhat often breaks up marriages or problems is money\nBecause people don't look and don't have some similar type of all I meant by the way we've been talking about taxes on today's show I think one of the biggest mistakes we see people may is they want to pay for their kids or their grandkids college\nAnd so what are they do they just give them money um it was just nice finally don't I'm not in ... and it's not a nice gesture\nFor why aren't they using vehicles like five twenty nine savings plans I mean you've seen this for people and it's a surprise they don't take advantage of this\nThere's there there are excellent I mean they have they have multiple tax advantages you feel good about yourself put the money in there you can take it out tax free it can be used for an assortment of expenses it's just the right way to go\nYeah well I guess people options I think number one is\nIt it it helps avoid taxes so if you're doing a lot of money it can actually help avoid gift tax is um if you're doing a little bit you actually get state tax breaks now depends on what state you're in so I'm not going to give any tax advice here on the show\nI can tell you in the state of Nebraska there is a benefit for us so I mean it's something I take advantage of with my children as I make contributions into their five twenty nine plans and\nI think one of the best things I can say is the earlier you start the better so if you have a brand new grandbaby brand new kid putting in a hundred dollars a month or two hundred dollars or whatever you're most comfortable with\nCan lead to a significant dollar amount time by the time they're Eighteen and Nineteen years old and you'd be amazed what can be in there and I can help cover one or two years now I Can't tell you how much college is going to cost Eighteen years from now I Know if you go to\nUm the University of Nebraska Lincoln or Creighton or another place it's not going to be an in significant sum of money in wall we're all wishful grandparents and parents that are kids are going to get scholarships everywhere the reality is that doesn't always happen\nAnd we have to figure out ways so if I can help get money and my three children's five twenty nine plan and get a tax break that sounds like a double win for me rather than double pain that go Jim\n... the other area that we are going to lead into it here soon it would be your Ross conversions a topic that we've talked about before on on shows and I'm going to tell you right now a great story we had a people commit actually listen to the radio show they wanted a second opinion\nAnd we went through a few things ask a few questions last week and they said well we want to do a Ross conversion and they were under the impression that they had until April of twenty Nineteen to do that\nNo they only had until December thirty first of this tax year so\nSafe from there I mean just by them coming in and chatting with us we're able to help them out\nThere yeah I'm going to go back to see see here for a moment I mean so I Love to hear that\nYour school is offering a personal finance class 'cause I think it's important but there's only so much you can teach people in one class and so\nYou know me pretty well cc and you know that I got the certified financial planner designation over this last year and you saw how much time I spent studying for this right yeah yeah it was too much probably but it was enough and I did take\nSix classes plus by the way I have Twenty years of experience and I don't do everything and I certainly don't a test and knowing everything you don't have to keep shaking your head like you know I thank you for that I'm Glad this isn't on TV uh but", "show_name": "Wealth From Wisdom with Ron
