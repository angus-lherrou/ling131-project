to share with a group of people but he would agree with us if you wait too long to put together strategy you're really making a mistake\nTalking about less than number two taking your required minimum distribution at the wrong time\nIt was like calling the wrong place you're not going to call a Hail Mary play when you got third and a half a yard we just need to have yard for first down so let's talk about this one of the most important things to know is your age Seventy and a half and if you fail to take this distribution we're talking a fifty percent penalty that's five zero\nNot fifty cent five zero fifty percent penalty that could happen so if your birthday is between January in June\nYou're going to turn to Seventy and a half in the same year so you've got to take the distribution correct yep but if you're a birthday is July through December you actually can wait till the next year to ... take the distribution because of the Seventy and a half wrong but but the problem\nThere is if you wait till the following year then you're gonna have to take to distributions that year which could push you into another tax bracket which could affect your Social Security or Medicare and all those things so here again Paul back to having a strategy proper tax planning as you move closer to those years\nYeah no I mean and by the way the gym I Know we just had our Medicare of at the other day that\nYou think about this not only did two are MDs grading impact\nBut also in now can put you in the next category in the next amount that charges you monthly for your Medicare premiums and I mean that's just like compounding upon compound in upon compound in for people so you you that's why you have to start planning ahead of time\nYou may say to yourself Paul I don't want to pay taxes the government until the absolute positively last possible moment\nBut if you look at it and you actually pay them less by taking your distribution that first year you may be making the best decision to ultimately pay the least amount of taxes than almost sounds a little bit counter to do I wait a minute you want me to pay right away versus waiting\nWell yeah if it's going to save you thousands of thousand dollars and we're going to go through the show today in gym and share some real life stories with real numbers on how that actually happened\nFor many of our listeners\nMaybe you think about it I mean I I'm ... their look in their jobs right they know everybody's going to keep harassing in life and at age Seventy and a half they're going to get their money they're going to begin to get it and most people don't plant\nSo what happens they just wandering endlessly and you know I got to do it so I'm going to pay it and they don't think about on a planet\nSo if you have an

I\nAsked them why did you log in and they said number one reason as to check my balance or say what are you checking for are you checking it for growth\nThey said no I said okay well I'm I'm I'm intrigued why are you log in they said were logging in to make sure everything looks normal\n[laughter] made off or okay yeah no I mean really I think you're right Jim I think it's people are logging

Jim Caldwell and so they were dealing five common mistakes that people needlessly make that shouldn't cost him a fortune taxes but they do because they don't pay attention and just\nIrritates me started was because there but it was just like it just\nIs one of those things like if you look at your to list or was that phrase oh you're a honey do list or whatever else those things are write it down and get it done you're going to feel this sense of financial independence you're going to feel empowered on your life\nAnd I mean I think back like we all have those projects on our plate that we don't like to do and we write them down and what happens they push one day and the next day in the next day and eventually they fall off our list or we just never do 'em\nBut those ones and sometimes you know I I coach people on this is move that task you don't want to do up to the top of your list and get it done first though we are not dreading it all day or thinking about it or keep kicking the can down the road\nAnd we see this with armed de so let's talk about a way that actually people are kicking down the road and they shouldn't be because right now in twenty eight team there is a good opportunity for you for next advice piece here is is take advantage of Iraq conversion\nSo this may not be appropriate for everyone but you need your in individual numbers looked at\nThe ... really is part of the Trump tax plan here is you can actually move a portion some or all to her off to help save your money and by the way\n... well it doesn't allow tax free contributions it does allow you to pay zero\nZero zero zero zero acts when you withdraw money retirement and you don't have to deal with our MDs so if you need ten thousand one year but twenty five thousand two years later that's fine you don't have to keep taking out like a shirt earlier that twenty three thousand four hundred and thirty seven dollars\nPer year essentially if you're sending two years old six hundred thousand so\nKey number here the number five ... five gyms the number five here is you must have the money\nThe in the raw for five years before you take out so I don't think like hey I can go convert at right now twenty Eighteen and get the tax free benefit to go along with it you do need to wait those five years so that's why now getting started now\nWhat was the advice and gave everyone gym in the last segment about when you start actual your tax planning Seventy five yeah fifty five plus here so again if you're a viewer Ross you need to five years you better start now if you're waiting 'til age sixty eight sixty nine\nYou might be too late to take advantage of this really cool technique and what's important though is is understanding how to really\nPut all of this together for yourself well and also\nBy converting to a Roth you have an opportunity to transfer of wealth to other generations tax free that's a big thing with higher net worth people also that they say well I'll probably never going to need this money to live on her spend on but to be able to transfer down to kids grandchildren and other generations\nYeah my wife you want a Roth review just give us a call eight eight eight for one nine eighty five Thirteen it's so personal gym I mean we're not going to be labor at this point so much on the radio here today but I just remind her last minute conversion doesn't save you from taking an RMC it's a huge mistake that we see so many people make\nA so I Know we don't spend a ton of time talking about the market but I Do want to talk about this for a moment Jim so something big happened did a lot of people didn't even realize that are paying attention and really what happened is\nThere is a big change in the ass and the five hundred related to how all the different sectors so you think about there's the financial sector there's the technology sector there's the you know communication factor in on September twenty first so just very recently a change when in a place moving some key\nCompanies from one sector to the other so if you had these in your portfolio while you didn't have any tax adjustments in your portfolio you did have potentially some changes to what you held so for example\nMany of you own alphabet or Google whatever [laughter] call it or you're on Facebook well this is actually moved there was a new sector created is called the communications sector so the is actually moved from the technology sector into the new communications sector\nBig big deal so if you said ON Technology and I own alphabet and Facebook guess what\nYou know ... you know you don't even know it and now he's still some younger not in there so of course Microsoft than their apples in their um you know been out there a bigger bigger percentage\nOf that specific sector so at one of the reasons why they did this is just this time of all the lapses the market changes I mean I ... I'm a I'm curious to ask you how many people ask you how the Dow thirty are doing\nZero zero zero okay so that's not greater than one that's zero zero\nYeah people don't asset anymore why the top thirty companies and the Dow is and how people look at their baseline so it's probably the most common benchmark you see people use\nIt doesn't pay five hundred probably the most or the Dow Jones yeah I Would say Dow Jones ranks first has to be five hundred and go second\nI'm going to disagree with you I think if the U.S in the hands down because that's my personal belief in New York with different people than I Do um so but I mean I think people see that in", "show_name": "Wealth From Wisdom with Ron Carson", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "06"}
