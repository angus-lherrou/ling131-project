prepare a stream of income but have you evaluated it versus everything the answer was of course no I said well has the broker not the advisors but has the broker talk to you about this what are the annual cost of the annuity\nHow much sales commission are they getting paid for doing this and then what are the underlying investment management fees for all of their products inside of that and ...\nAnd you know what the answer was across the other phone I have no idea I don't know and huh what do you mean by that because people are confused so you have to remember if you're doing and duty

seven specific challenges you're going to face in retirement and really how you can protect yourself\nIn a segment where to keep talking about those and one of them is not planning for really the skyrocketing costs of health care and long term care because to the gym called well and Jim I mean there's one thing for sure\nHealthcare is going to continue to go up and at some point every family tends to run into a health issue with you your spouse a parent a child and well we have to make sure this doesn't turn into a financial catastrophe so let me give you real numbers here\nSo for the average sixty five year olds if you're listening right now you're below sixty five think about when you are if you are you're going to hit this on knows and if you're above it\nThink about how much money if you actually spent on health care and they now say the latest estimates are the average sixty five year old couple retiring today\nIs going to spend more than four hundred thousand dollars between health care premiums um Medicare all of these things supplemental insurance deductibles co pays\nHave you put away for a hundred thousand for retirement blisters if you have a are you going to earmark it and what does that look like and yeah and most people think Medicare\nWill help cover the majority of your cost but actually voyage his practice and they share the bail Medicare only covers actually about sixty percent of all retirement health costs sixty\nPercent and that's why you got to make sure you have the right plan in place in one of those is with long term care so I mean if you're in the fifties if you haven't talked to someone about long term care and by someone who's a fiduciary that can help you out and not try to sell you something case you don't need it\nYou better talks on again if you're in fifty to sixty such a prime time to be talking about that with an advisor joined or help or somebody's propose it to you and you just want to compliment your second opinion you can always email us that info at Carson wealth dot com or happy to help provide you a second opinion to make sure\nYour people are doing what's right for you and what they're recommending a gym I mean I'm sure you address this all the time people approaching this long term care decision and what's right or wrong for them because the average cost I mean it's staggering\nYeah I uh what we see is people are in denial it's like not that we're going to happen to me I mean I'm not going to end up in a home or the wife says I'll take care of my husband husband says we'll take care of the wife\nAnd and I've seen that in real life that doesn't work either okay so I'll give you a feel good story so good to house or the working with for ten years husband and wife they have plenty of cash flow plenty a retirement everything's looking really pretty\nHusband doesn't ever wanna retires in his seventies still work and just because he loves to work but he always had this one insurance policy that\nWe couldn't really figure out what to move the money out of there for okay and when we talk about insurance or long term care you could just see he just wasn't interested in hearing that and then all of a sudden we presented that wealth plan to him and he saw how all the dots connected\nAnd he brought it up he says I think it's time to do something with this chunk of money what do you suggest we were able to on a tax advantage basis ball move that money out of there and to a combination hybrid long term care insurance contract and kind of feel in some sand and that sand box for him\nSo wait a minute so someone had a preconceived notion then absolutely not absolutely not absolutely not\nRight he didn't see him self ever needing that type of help in his latter years\nYeah and so what what was it that changed ... I'm fascinated by this because\nI think a lot of us you know I'm like a better analogies here digger heels and and you know just say hey we're not budging because we've got this I call it does block bias in our brain that ... I'm not going to do that now you know bringing out that's that's immovable I call\nWall part of it was when his wife raptor hands rather slowed to get his that was and I was telling moment okay and she's a tough woman but I think it was the fact that he did look at all the assets he did review the wealth plan that we put together for him and he saw things that he never saw before because he never had a plan\nAnd now he saw the potential problems could be and she recognized that and help with that decision process\nYeah and I would say Jim people when they see the real number so like again I tell her own you know on the show I mean this could be sixty thousand dollars a year it could be a hundred thousand plus if you want a private room and the nicest facility and like oh great Paul that's the number that's not going to impact me\nBut if you haven't been to a facility\nIn a while you should because there's a big difference and by the way you know bless all the hearts and soles of our health care\nProviders because what they do is so important um I don't do it I just I I just thank them so much for everything they do and what they need to get paid I mean it's not easy and I think we've all seen I Know you're going through with your family Jim I have with mine is when you're taking care of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Wealth From Wisdom with Ron Carson", "city": "Omaha", "day": "20"}
