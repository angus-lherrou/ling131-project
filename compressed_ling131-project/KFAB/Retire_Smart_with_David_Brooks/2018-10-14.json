along\nProtection acts reduction planning financial and income\nEverybody welcome in on consumer advocates states at all and this is retirement boss radio where you take\nCharge of your money and with me of course that they never stays a financial advisor for helping other socio so Dave how are you a nice to see you didn't get Steve are you do it yeah I've never better this is going to be an interesting segment I think in that the average American can expect to live into their eighties today on your own money five percent of sixty five year olds go past the age of Ninety yeah we've got to do some planning\nI'm sixty three my father passed away Thirteen Years ago but my mother Ninety five yeah we're big or the brass bands and we set up a tailgate on our for every home game and we had a surprise birthday party for my mother she was Ninety five years old\nAnd I mean incredible I mean she had it so when they replaced but last year she had other total new replacement this year I mean that wouldn't have happened twenty thirty forty years old course not you know when when when Social Security started in Nineteen thirty five Social Security started paying out at the age of sixty five not early not later it was\nTo go he's fine with it [laughter] okay they asked me right\nAnd that was in the night that was in Nineteen thirty five\nNineteen thirty five yeah the actual first payment came in Nineteen forty one but it started in Nineteen thirty five and of course they had to fund it before they started paying it but the interesting thing is the Nineteen thirty five the average American live to the age of sixty three\n[laughter] and you couldn't collect until sixty four hundred and fifty five that math were pretty darn good job than I Do now let me get started early uh sixty two ... with which uh forty percent of the people start as early as a kid a fifty two\nVery few people only three percent Steve wait until the age of Seventy so what happens is is that people are just living so much longer Social Security is this is such a great benefit\nFor folks today but back in in in Nineteen thirty five or Nineteen forty you know what you were lucky to live long enough just to get the benefits\nRight and that's certainly obviously not the case of it because we are talking to people who get you know a hundred hundred fifty two hundred thousand dollars just in Social Security over the time\nOh or or much more than that really more than that too yeah\nOh yeah I tell you what it is I just didn't want for a husband and wife and I was thinking the hope that it would live to the age of eighty five and a wife to the age or Ninety even though they still have parents living and there are and they're just like fifty eight fifty nine years of age and it was a million dollar Social Security benefits\nWow what a lot of amazing how cool is that that you get to do that for folks [noise]\nYeah yeah it's really great you know to try to maximize that give you know what you want you don't want to know you don't want to claim your Social Security here something three years down the road and say gosh if I were the only thing that I Would have done something different learn beforehand we have a socialist\nCarrie analysis it's if it's an eleven page color graphs and there's ... they'll spreadsheets all of the uh money's outcomes and it certainly could benefit them in the long haul\nYeah absolutely so one of the keys I think is is a diversification right when it comes to ... you know just taking care of our our assets are portfolios right\nYeah that's right now just having diversification but having the proper asset allocation of that is let's say that you have X Y Z stock mutual fund okay and then you've got\nA B C Stock mutual fund you got hail him into the stock mutual fund yeah you don't want your diversified amongst fund families but they all kind of have\nThat same investment type so if the if that stock market goes down ... most likely all of those will go down together asset allocation is when you have a either not\nCorrelation or or kind of a negative correlation so if you have a stock and you have a bond portfolio bonds\nUm don't have a real high correlation to stocks or there's other non correlated types of investment so when I look at the core\nA investments that are available of core their stocks\nThere's barns there's cash or cash equivalent really anything outside of that and we do our fair share of complementary investment business with those non correlated types and that's I think that that effort allocation is it is is very important and lastly on this subject\nYou know when you look at risk the type of risk that you want to take\nMany people when you look when actually dissect their portfolio and their four O. one K. or their IRA or their investment plan\nThere many times taking more risk\nThan they thought I we we just had a lady that came from the radio show a call in and we had an appointment and actually it was the third appointment that we had\nAnd I was proposing but the point before I went through in twenty right at twenty percent effort portfolio was in a single bio pharmacy stock and get a lot of this right now is trading for a hundred and fifty dollars a share a hundred and Seventy one was the high for the fifty to a guy\nForty to fifty two week low that means that there is a Seventy percent\nChange in value from high to low well when you're in you're when you're in your late fifties early sixties can you afford to take that kind of risk most people can't really didn't understand the type of risk she's taking so then you start looking at\nWhat has lesser risk or maybe even a much more capital of um preservation so that's what we try to do is to really care to dissect that rest and and let the person know\nHere's what could happen if they think oh my gosh that seems like a lot of ... lost it happened well then what happens is you start toning down that type of risk for that potential client\nMhm wow yeah and and again that that makes sense um what about managing the the accounts I mean we sort of touching on that a little bit but where does that how does that fit into all of that\n[noise] you know what you're talking about managing four O. one K. accounts okay\nYeah so let's say this let's\nI'm going to give an example 'cause it's the perfect thing I talked to another client and then and and again it was from the radio show came on and he's an engineer but what happens is he's got a\nCouple of a guy called dormant ... or ... yeah I mean he worked for other companies and they just left him there and he's being fairly aggressive which he is the media's mindset is fairly aggressive but what happens is is that\nI Want to know who's who's kind of watching\nThose four O. one K. investments I mean I mean are are you making rebalance things and are you making a judgment calls on the investments or you're pretty much just letting it right\nWell I mean when I leave the company the company no longer really cares about your four one K. right off\nThe company does it but but the custodian the mutual fund you normally go to the custodian of that you can certainly call and make rebalance things but you know what Steve\nBy far the majority that people don't know of course they just they just let it ride in probably one of the worst things you do is is taken emotional stance on it that means when the market is really really are going down and\nAll of a sudden it gets lower lower lower you raise the flag and say I can't take any more there's there's a a fair amount of folks that just emotionally get a test of how much their money at least they take everything out and they leave it out so when the market rebounds\nThey never participate in that rebound the all or none mentality kind of timing very tough or this is an old old saying I saw in the end of the wall Street Journal I read this morning or yesterday today but it said what's important if it's it's time in the market not timing the market\nOh All right so let's talk taxes for a moment if we can get a little bit of time in in the um so that tax strategy that is something that you guys do so well", "show_name": "Retire Smart with David Brooks", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "14"}
