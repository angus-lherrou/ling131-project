Warren Buffett one of the the\nRichest people in the world from Omaha Nebraska of course you know what happens is is that is that he has a tremendous amount of cash on hand what Berkshire Hathaway sure if you take a look at some of the of the big time companies Microsoft oracle um they all have a lot of cash apple a lot of cash on hand why\nBecause there's bargains out there if they want to buy companies also\nIt gives them a hedge against a a failing market or real downturn in the economy so I think it's no different you have to have some discipline\nBut it whether it's a fifty bucks a hundred dollars a couple of hours but until you're up to that three months six months of um emergency fund you shouldn't be putting that they're ... and you're just hedging yourself in case of the unexpected bad time\nOf course one of the other ways that we can sort of the uh get through that is to take a look flood insurance we have and make sure that we have the proper insurance in the proper categories\n[noise] yeah you know what happens is is that why do people buy insurance well first of all which is really interesting it's one of the few things that you buy any hope you never use it right [laughter]\nI buy life insurance but gosh I don't want to die that collected I by car insurance I ... I don't I don't want to get an a wreck to collect no of course then yeah you know you you buy insurance to basically offset the costly unexpected of that\nThat's why you buy insurance sure so what happens is is that it takes you know it's it's it's very inexpensive\nOr to cover the cost of something by insurance than it would be to go in and to pay for just like with car insurance I played it you know I think I'm paying I don't know it's probably a hundred and fifty dollars a month or two vehicles and\nWhat happens is we have the same day both those vehicles are where our fault and and and they both were totaled well it'd be tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars that have a pocket but now with insurance you're offsetting the risk so that's one thing I think also when you're talking specifically about life insurance\nIf you you know if you\nHave young folks that are still at home and I remember my expertise ... around kind of the free retired retired so most of my people that kids are just getting out of the out of the home of the kind of getting on their own in in in paying for their own expenses\nAre getting out of college but what happens is do you still have debt if you still have debt left then I think life insurance plays a big factor\nIf you don't have any debt you know you're getting towards their retirement or retirement you know how important is to have that that insurance will it isn't life insurance isn't as important than and the last thing I think you know\n... from from a life insurance standpoint um I see probably is almost as many people at this stage again that's over insured than under insured so so you want to buy what you really need you want to buy a ... the protection of what you need not what you needed at the age of thirty five or forty but\nAt the age of sixty sixty ... years of age right\nOkay well good I mean you know that whole thing that whole I'm sure we can have a whole show about insurance and was what it is one of ... yeah I'm not but again this one to me is that was one of the most important and that is\nTo make sure you take the emotion out of it I mean when you're dealing with whether it's an illness or whether it's a hurricane or or whatever it might be we are emotionally invested in can sometimes not make the best decisions\nYeah you don't want to make big decisions um after a you know after a big emotional I'm kind of a misshapen big emotional event has happened and the reason for that is is is there was a left brain has the right brain the left brain is the more\nI'm I'm kind of calculating\nA mathematical the right brain as more of the emotional part of the brain and what happens is is that your decisions should be made from a factual standpoint\nAnd many times when when tough tough things have happened\nUm whether it be a death in the in the family say a spouse or a child or there's been um um um you know you're retiring or got me just got fired those are called now now if you're retiring and you thought about longtime no you you pretty much kind of went in and\nAnd I understand what's happening but if something happens all the sudden\nThen you probably don't want to make big decisions right after that if you can so so taking a motion you know in in in the stock market itself and I already said that in in today's show but you know you can go back to economics one on one you make money", "show_name": "Retire Smart with David Brooks", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "07"}
