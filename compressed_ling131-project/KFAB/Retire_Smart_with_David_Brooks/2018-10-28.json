leaving um south Georgia we're now have to pay a bill\n... and so what should we know about this race right now we're Stacey Abrams who's just sort of broken onto the scene in a big way\nWell it's fascinating to me as a Georgia I mean I'm born and raised in the state and so I watched it change over the years that you and so many other political observers have and it's just fascinating to me because this is a bare knuckle tight tight race and not just a race between a Democrat and Republican but a rift between\n... a very conservative Republican any progressive Democrats and it is so tight that nobody can actually predict where this is going a black woman for granted against you know that the the classic southern\nWhite man and I think so many eyes across the country are on this race because it is such an interesting maybe they'll whether about what's happening in this country\nWe I was going to say that that does not sound like a classic toss up for for Georgia right that does not sound like a classic bare knuckle brawl that sounds like something that your classic Republican would win ... y you Stacey Abrams making inroads\nWell that's the thing that we're so interested in talking with her about the last time a Democrat\nWon a double the governor's race here in Georgia was sixteen years ago this state is very conservative I changed a lot since I was here\nThe folks that I'm Talking to you and I've got a long time political for here who say it's been a demographic shift here that I'm like so many other states culturally millennials she actually has not only a great energized black\nA base of support but she's still a lot of young white men and women who are also on her progressive trained so it's they're all very interesting to see that this date seems to be shipped in ... but how much I think of course made one election happened\nYeah it was going to say that we've seen Democrats in Georgia get close but not always get that cigar so um let me ask you though about whether it's gender or race I mean you've got people that do seem fired up about ... voter suppression right now about who gets to vote can you just kind of walk us through what happened in Georgia that's making that such a big issue\nWell that is such a huge issue in that we talk to 'em or a grape civil rights advocate\nIn his ... who has been sort of fighting a fight about voter access for many many years and this is a\nBig big issue here about voter suppression of people who are claiming their actions lawsuits that are being filed here in the states saying that the secretary of state\nBrian Kemp who's also who said he's fifty eight a opponent who's running for governor [noise] that people are saying that his campaign has basically suited um heating up voter suppression tactic\nThere is a there are a lot of things at play here in Georgia voter ID laws which a lot of people of course associate with discouraging voters were going to the polls um he's got a ... their applications to vote that are being held right\nNow because as opposed to letting irregularities their polling places that have been closed down and you know over a period of time people who've been purged from the rolls the voting rolls after not having voted for a few years many\n... and Brian and Brian Kemp it as a secretary of state and Brian ... the actual guided overseas voting right that's why that's why his name was attached to this\nExactly and he's not the only one I mean in other states this has happened to where you know a secretary of state has run for office that they're actually in charge overseeing the boats but that is a big part of a big point intention and Stacey Abrams is and Jesse that\nHe should step down to he shouldn't be secretary of state while he's running for governor so there are a lot of eyes on this race because there are so many factors here\nPeople will point to at least five different types of factors that people say might actually suppress the vote or discouraged that vote here\nFascinating race not one you will see effect Capitol Hill but certainly like ... percent this sort of bellwether perhaps for the mood of the country is

about a specific word volatility it's still hanging around so we can talk about that a little bit but a man I got to tell you just a ... and ... of great economic news right locally in national and so I think that's where we should start is just talking about a lot of a lot of great news\nOutlets pat ourselves on the back saying that the state of Nebraska you are fiscally stable and that and that says a lot and that was done by study by George Mason\nThe market just center which is basically the business school operations at George Mason university my older brother is in alum there that's where he actually did undergrad he's an attorney today a but basically they did a fiscal studying the fiscal ranking of all fifty states and basically this ranking\nIs ah looking at what's that basically what's the soundness of their financial or wherewithal right the balance sheet do they have enough so they they rank you based on financial solvency so they looked at cash solvency in other words\nDo you have is a state enough cash on hand\nYou know basically to pay your short term bills budget solvency in other words can a state oh cover it's complete spending for the year with the revenues it's going to have\nOr is it working off of the budget shortfall we know many governments are operating on on a deficit spending right on and on the long term solvency in other words what is the ability for the state to meet its long term commitments\nLike a you know pensions et cetera things of that nature will there be enough money really to do that even if we were to have\nA fiscal correction a stock market correction in economic recession can you still pay your bills and then a surface level solvency in other words can\nThe the state operate based on its revenue sources from income taxes and then property taxes et cetera uh to provide the services not you know like fire police\nOr assisted living facilities that that the health care all the things the services the state is responsible by even if there's a a fiscal calamity and Nebraska ranked extremely high in every one of these in the overall rank yes I'm happy to tell you in Nebraska ranked number one\nThat's fantastic news here on many fronts because it also our current governor governor records who is in the middle of a reelection campaign or if I were him I'd be chatting this news from the the rooftops uh\nBut but there are some there are when you look into the study of all the fifty states there are some unique\nA points for instance the top five states number one Nebraska number two or ...\nWe're here to the north South Dakota number three was Tennessee number for my previous home Florida ... and number five Oklahoma now what you all five of those states have in common\nAnd they're all it takes [laughter] yes they are all run by Republican leadership and hadn't been for consistently for some period of time\nAnd that is a help them if you look at the bottom five states [laughter] they're all run by the opposing party right and I again not to get into politics here but actually the bottom nine are all ... been run by Democrats for a long period of time and again listen I'm not trying to tell people how to think politically but I'm telling you\nThis stuff matters if you think you're going to depend on the state to provide you services from everything local to the state level from\nHealth care initiative schools\nFire and safety all these things matter and you want your state to be fiscally sound so this is just I mean we had a pat ourselves on the back as you said this is fan\nTen news so a really really cool to see this study come out this week and uh I was actually surprised that no it was coming out and happened to catch it when Israelis 'cause my brother is a part of the newsletter system at George Mason for his right to me so really good information\nSo David what else is in the news I see where Warren Buffett the oracle of Omaha recently sold his house in California\nThe man made a pretty good profit just under I think five thousand percent if you calculate on percentage is\nThis is the house he bought [laughter] you know several decades back in Laguna Beach ... ah and just didn't really wasn't using it and so so that this was not a big deal as far as ... concerned but\nBut I it was noted here in the world Harold this past week an article talking about how he made forty nine hundred percent on that house now\nThe funny thing is if he decides if that was listed as a a rental property and I don't know I have not I don't know exactly I Know it was once a vacation home but if it was a rental and he decides to take the proceeds from that and reinvest it\nInto another rental property he would have to pay zero taxes on that ... basically taken advantage virus code\nOr ten thirty one and of course people complain and Warren Buffett it's been a vocal advocate I should pay more taxes well I'm I'll be curious to see if he does and you know because [laughter] you know ... if I was advising him I Would have been reinvest that capital into another piece of real estate and not pay a penny and tax is which is his constitutional right and so\nYou know we'll talk more about this later but that's you know one of my favorite topics\nIs taxation and the misinformation people have\nAre in fact we we just had a tax workshop last night David that I was uh giving and the question on real estate actually came up and we were discussing how you could sell real estate assets that are basically passive investment properties\nAnd not pay any tax and maybe even not paying the tax on the income why you own that investment\nAnd had somebody there who was a pretty I Would say pretty savvy real estate investor owns a a big swath of properties and we taught him a couple of things which he was very grateful for\nAh but that's just it is you folks will even we're talking about real estate in this particular moment but when it comes to everything that affects your finances and your retirement specifically\nYou don't know what you don't know and that is why we have created what we believed to be the best holistic look at people's retirement called a smart\nPlan it looks at everything from the income sources you're going to be receiving whether it's Social Security pension railroad income passive income from you know investments like real estate\nTo the taxes are going to pay income to the riskier shaking I mean it covers everything and so what I Want to focus on is basically if you have an investment and you're not sure\nYou know hey if I sold this right if I saw this investment how does that affect me tax wise\nThen you should be one of the people that wants to get a report card done we call it the smart retirement report card we've created this very easy to understand\nQuick overview of your current financial situation and we're going to grade you just like when you're in school you're going to get a grade and of course in in school the smart kids were always on the dean's list straight A's or got honor roll typically A's and B's\nWe don't see that very often when we give you a grade ahead reality is most people don't get score that high but the reality is David you could with a few adjustments to a plan and so if you would like to get a complementary retire smart smart retirement report card hits a tongue twister today [laughter]\nThen exactly just give us a call or text the word smart to four o two three six nine seven seven seven seven against for oh two three six nine seven seven seven\nSeven so look at it again at the the volatility of the market uh it's kind of going up and it came to it settled down a little bit ah somewhat you know corrected itself if you will but now it's kind of getting more\nUh thanks to a President Trump's tweets sometimes it just kind of throws a market a a myth and even though he's kind of upset with the the feds\nOr for saying that you know that's his biggest threat is the Federal Reserve because they're moving the interest rates too high and his his his in at least in his eyes\nBut then you have like Netflix that's really doing really well with their recent
