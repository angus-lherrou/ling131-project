P. S. pension plan is got a monster shortfall we'll talk that so man ... and and the even the healthcare we've got to new information on the health plans available here for Nebraska for next year so man we got lots of coverage\nSo with the market volatility let's start with that I mean I Know that you had predicted that there was going to be some sort of sign in the market volatility that would say you know this could be the end of the bull market maybe not we don't know but for investors who are thinking hey what should we do uh what do you tell them\nIf you have the properly designed plan that we think is the way to do it right have a a a true long-term perspective and have a plan design where the risk of your portfolio matches your desires not what someone tells you ... uh the you're going to be fine and whether it through this our clients are fine however there are\nA had a conversation yesterday with someone who's not yet a client but we're in in conversation right on on that topic and engaging um and this person a basically called me because they lost about Seventy grand and one day you're recently um and it was a shock to them and that's you know I just like look this is what I told you want to show you the way you have your portfolio\nAnd it why we would change some things um and so anyway that person's back on the schedule and coming back in but listen if you have a properly designed plan\nThe day to day noise can go away you shouldn't have to function by looking everyday where's the market what is the six o'clock news going to tell me right that is no way to live in retirement as we talk many many times someone who was in a just\nYesterday where we were doing the review and you know ask every one of you when you come in for your view hey how many perfect days you think you had last year right and that's what we're shooting for that is access right we want you to enjoy yourself and so if you're staring at the screen\nProbably not doing you're probably not having the retirement you envision right so uh what are the key metrics though why is the volatility here so let's talk about what I talked about for the last three or four months I've mentioned it sporadically is rising rates but not only rising rates you have to pay attention\nAt the different rates in other words the different maturity rate so short term rates versus mid term rates versus long term rates right so in in historically speaking David we have what's called the yield curve right and ... just means typically\nShort term interest rates are lower than a longer term so the longer you go the more the rate rises and if you plot that out on a graph it would be like an up sloping curve right so that's called the yield curve well\nFor quite some time now he's basically had a flat\nYield curve and we've almost had it in fact in Vert and that's one of the things we always talk about what I mean invert short term rates are actually higher than rates that are longer and maturity and as we speak now\nThe ten years we told you has harmed along it's up there hovering between three and three and a three point three percent so it's a averaging about three and a quarter that's moved quite a bit but right behind it is the two year a very short term rate is well over three percent now that sitting around like three point one so so the spreads\nAre narrowing and if they actually invert that is a one hundred percent predict or\nAt least in the last four decades of coming\nRecession that would be something we'd want to pay attention to right mhm so so again what does all this meanwhile means if you've got the right guy or gal helping you through this you're not going to worry about the white noise because you've got a good long term plan and the assets that you choose to have\nRisk which should not be all of your assets but the assets that you do have at risk should have an active lead designed plan on what they're going to do when things go\nA differently than as expected again it's all about designing the right plan so that when you're in retirement you can enjoy your retirement and not pay attention to the white noise so meant a lot of volatility a so again look\nIf you want to figure out where you are than than what we do is we've crafted a simple review that is a complimentary it's called the smart retirement report card where we can just basically grade\nWhere you are on all these different areas that are going to affect your retirement is five meters we're going to great for you or we won't be able to go into detail and all those today of course but we will do this for you complimentary if you'd like to be one of those folks that gets a compliment any smart report card\nI have limited time in the schedule so we're only gonna allow the first seven folks that volunteer this week Ford that step up and want to get this done seven folks do is call\nOr even tax just the word smart\nTo our office at four O. two three six nine seven seven seven seven again for oh two\nThree six nine seven seven seven seven and get the smart retirement report card so you can find out where you great out say the smart kids made on our own school right that's where you want your retirement let's find out where you stand David for oh two three six nine seven seven seven seven\nAnd so some other people who want to know where they stand or people who are affected by the school board and what's going on with the pension problems\nSo unfortunately I'm this is the second oldest teacher pension in the United states our pension here locally from Omaha public schools was founded in I Believe in Nineteen oh six right been around a while and unfortunately we had some really bad mismanagement of the assets within the planned themselves\nAnd then we also had mismanagement on the part of\nThe school board itself in directing how much money they should have been putting into the plan so they've been kicking the can\nDown the proverbial curb for quite some time within underfunded pension now I can get into the constitutionality that I don't believe it should be as it is but here's the reality the plan as it sits with the amount of retirees they have and future retirees they they need actually they should be looking at about two point wanted to point two billion dollars\nIn the fun and we only have one point two billion that's a problem right now big big problem and then they're under funding it by the tune of about twenty five to twenty eight million dollars each year under funding the pension that just compounds the problem going further on top of that I did a review actually here because I was asked to\nA on a local talk radio stations asked me to do this review live on air and we did recently ah basically\nThey're they're not fun to get enough\nThey have an unrealistic investment a return profile and they're paying too much in the so they're just getting ... everywhere so they're paying too much for the investment management\nThey're expecting unrealistic returns a for instance last year the markets were phenomenal right we had a Nineteen plus percent up time on the S P five hundred and yet this pension made nine and a half percent", "show_name": "Retire Smart with David Brooks", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "21"}
