NAFTA is apparently a thing of the past now after twenty four years we have a newly forged agreement now agreed to apparently in principle between Canada\nMexico in the United states the president calls at the U.S MCA the United states Mexico Canada agreement you know that the White House this morning officially and is now taking questions from the media will get right back into this the question has just come down from a one of the reporters assembled there at the White House\nOn how the tension between President Trump and Kennedy ... prime minister Justin Trudeau affected disagreement\nI don't think he did he's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions that it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or\nAnd now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal to brand new deal not NAFTA re done it's a brand new deal I just spoke with him we have a great relationship but we're going to work as a partner\nDon't forget the rest of the world is looking to take advantage of us and has a region you might say and we're going to work very closely together with Canada and Mexico\nBecause we'll be able to compete with anybody we have we have things that nobody else as we have energy that nobody else has we have Kimber that nobody else has we have things that\nNo other part of the world has to the extent that we have so we're going to do very well together I think we have there was a lot of tension I Will say between\nHe and I I think more specifically and it it's all worked out\nYou know what it ended about twelve o'clock last night and you mentioned the but he's a good man he's done a good job and he he loves that people have Canada\nOreo skip ahead just a few moments in his news conference get a better audio feed the president now addressing a China countries\nFall but a little bit our country school and then\nIn the Nineteen thirties they said we better start charging some terrorists we need money to come into our country again\nSo I'm not advocating terrace I Will tell you this are steel industry Wilbur stronger than it's been and twenty five years just taking six months because I charge for the dumpsters they would dumping steel and dumping aluminum into our country I charge twenty five percent that's a lot\nBut that's a lot\nIf you look at US Steel new car new court just announced a billion dollar plant brand new already started construction us deals building eight or nine plants they're expanding plans\nI don't think there's any industry like what's happened is still in the last nine months ten months since I really started doing what I'm doing that's been really pretty amazing\nAluminum also so and we need we need still for defense\nWhat are we going to do go and say well we'll get our steal from like another country can't do that [noise] excuse me we can't do that\nSo we need steel\nBadly for defense so I'm very proud of what's happened with the steel industry okay question yeah go ahead sure\nShocked that I picked her in the state of shock [laughter] I'm not\nThinking of that type of area I Know you're not thinking you never do I'm Sorry\nAhead go ahead\nAnd actually this weekend Mr President you said that is incorrect to say you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation\nWhat does that have to do is read I don't mind answering the question but you know what I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the news which is the cow but I Know ... how about talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody average Radiohead or Tracey ... hats or Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't\nWe have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair which is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it or industrial opposite our country loves it or if it's fair\nIt will pass I think it'll pass easily really easily 'cause it's a great deal I mean NAFTA past is one of the worst deals I've ever seen inconceivable that it was made fair question\nAnd the other question sank right I'll get back to you and the other ... I'd like to go forward in my cabinet question let's do that later and we'll call you a second time go ahead please\nThank you very much thank him sip it then you have described India right now I ... to basically\nAll India charges this tremendous tariffs when we send a\nHarley Davidson motorcycles other things to India they charge very very high tariffs and I've spoken to prime minister Modi and he's going to reduce them very substantially\nNobody ever spoke to these people\nHe said nobody ever spoke to me in other words we've had leaders you I'm not you know trying to be overly dramatic we've had\nPresidents of the United states and trade representatives that uh they never spoke to India Brazil's another one that's the beauty they charge us whatever they want [noise]\nSo if you ask some of the companies they say Brazil is among the toughest in the well maybe the toughest in the what we don't call them and say hey you're treating our companies unfairly you're treating our country unfairly\nSo India is a very very high ... they really charge tremendously high tariffs on motorcycles who was a hundred percent so you send a motorcycle into India there's a one hundred percent tariff now that is so high that it's like a barrier another word to it's going to buy it\nCosts you so much now they've already reduced that substantially but it's still too high a\nMy relationship with the\nIndia is great with prime minister Modi is great and they're going to start doing a lot they've already they've called us to make a deal we didn't even call them they called us to make a deal which is like shocking to papal yes there go ahead [noise]\nWell I don't there we go um I Do have a second question on the cabinet thing if when you get back to it if you take that you'll take that now no okay well the question I have to address\nOn trade the question I have on trade does this mean the end of tariffs if you could spell that out\nNo Canada no you can ask no no I'm\nJust still is staying where it is I don't know minimum\nBut it means we probably for the most part will be having to use tariffs unless we're unable to make a deal with the country for instance if we can make a deal with the European Union we will respectfully put tariffs on the cars the United states will take in\nBillions and billions of dollars into its coffers isn't that nice 'cause you don't hear that\nBecause I Want to send Carl Sagan okay yes sake but it'll taking billions and billions of dollars\nBut really what's gonna happen is they'll make the cars in the United states this way they don't have to pay the twenty five or twenty percent tax and could you spell I don't think you're going to have to use the terrorists too often but there will be cases where you have countries that are just\nAbsolutely not willing to do what's fair and reciprocal and in that case they'll pay tariffs and you know what the United States will do very well either way we do very well\nSo do you think it'll pass in Canada Mexico and more importantly I don't know if you're in the eye\nAnd tell you at all I Know as we made a deal [noise] the highly respected presidents and then the case of Canada the prime minister or\nAre satisfied with the deal is good for Canada good from Mexico it's good for all three this is a deal I'm not touted this is good for all three that's good and just that fact makes a good for us but this is good for all three\nBut there's a much different deal the NAFTA and this is much more of a reciprocal deal for the United states which is really good yeah go ahead Peter [noise]\nListening to the president live from the White House this morning it's eleven o'clock news radio eleven ten K. F. A. B. Omaha\nYou talk about being treated partially a will do that in a couple of let's finish up\nTrying to do with Brett Kavanaugh the wall Street Journal and started writing go ahead please\nI'm Mexican journalist sure ah it's so you're going to keep the ... steel another medium to Mexico and Canada until\nSuch time as we\nCan do something that would be a different like quotas perhaps so that our industry is protected we are not going to allow or steel industry\nTo disappear it was almost gone I'll tell you what if our country kept going the way it was going within two years you wouldn't have had a steel industry we have to have a steel industry we have to have it aluminum you know there are certain industries important so\nUh we are working on that now that wasn't part of this but we will do something and in fact Bob if you want you may want to say a couple of words about that because we're literally talking about that one hour ago\nIt was great thank you Mr President and I guess I Would say first of all they're two separate things as far as we're concerned we know that there are great interest to both countries we are engaged you can talk now with an effort to try to preserve the effect of our program and still take care of their needs and and the hopefully we'll be able to work that out but we are in communication with the ...\nReally take care of the needs of our steel companies I don't want plants lousy they're hiring thousands of workers all over the country I'm not giving that up\nBut but you get as soon as as president elect look for someone that's going to ... we have a we have a very good understanding\nA really good\nUh yes go ahead please\nI Am Mr President just hoping you can just reiterate on the terrorists what specifically what it takes for Canada or Mexico to be exempt from these tariffs and secondly did you consider dairy the deal breaker yeah she came to that area was a deal breaker\nAnd now for our farmers it's as you know substantially opened up much more and I know they can't open completely that farmers also you know they can't be overrun and I fully on and I tell them that I say look I understand you have limits but they could do much better and we've opened it up to our farmers so the\nRight [noise]\nAll right let's come on [noise] incorrect to say\nThat your limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into judge Kavanaugh but your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nWhen I didn't hear anything for what I said is let the Senate decide whatever they want to do is okay with me and also the FBI I think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time just so we all understand\nThis is our seventh\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma for a man that never had any\nAccusation any he's been out of bed statement about a misled I mean I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in this law school at Yale and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks is incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting a I Want them to do a very comprehensive a\nInvestigation whatever\nThat means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nI Want it to be comprehensive I actually think it's a good thing for judge Kevin ... I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly and the reason I'd like to go quickly very simple it's so simple because it's unfair to him at this point\nWhat his wife is going through\nWhat his beautiful children are going through is not describe ...\nIt's not describe ... it's not fair I think it's fair to do it to me because you know I've been gone from day one I'd been or from long before I got the office you've been doing it it's almost became ... I I think for me it's like a part of my job description to handle this\nBut as far as as far as ... this is a man that this is not from his world and you know what if they're not going to ...\nYou know things like this however what ever the senators want is okay with me they're going to be making a decision what ever they want is okay with me go ahead and that's not fair to do was\nWhat is the mail I I think the press is treated me unbelievably unfairly back when I Want I said the good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse and worse now than\nTheir logo but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico so [noise] no no please shut down thinking though has ever going to act out I got to be next you know I thought your ... go ahead\nI have two questions about judge Kavanaugh first there are now concerns that he may have lighter myth characterized his drinking while testifying if they find that he did do you think that bars him from being your Supreme\nCourt nominee while I watch I watch them I was surprised at how a vocally was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this is not a man that said that alcohol was apps that he was perfect with respect to alcohol or do I thought he was actually going back so many years I thought he was a\nExcellent the interesting thing is though nobody asked them about what's happened in the last twenty five thirty years during his professional career because I there were no bad reports\nYou you've had one yes yes ma'am [noise]\nPlease please please sit down\nAnd minutes Mr President and a final trade question a steel and aluminum tariffs won't be coming down from Canada and Mexico can you talk about whether there was discussion of ending those retaliatory tariffs against us well they're not retaliatory\nThey're really I'm trying to get some really bad things from happening there were dumping in our country\nIt was China and various others would dumping massive amounts of dead steel it's called ... there's also imperfect steel\nInside that ... was a lot of bad things that make for a week or steel so when we're building bridges and you have much steel or you have other\nQuantities of other material in that steel that's a very bad thing it's very unsafe so it's not just economic his you know we have the miners have been very thankful for what you saw that the other night in West Virginia and we have a metal allergic\nCoal and other materials we have minds that are opening up now to get that incredible stuff this is used not for heating and cooling this is yours and electric this is used to make steel\nAnd those mines are now opening up and we're making steel and the prices are going to end up being less because we don't have the shipping problems when you ship it from places so far away you'll see we'll have hundreds of new plants opened up in our country and there'll be competing against each other\nAnd outsiders won't be able to can be just so you understand what was going to happen they were going to knock out every steel plant we had\nAnd then they were going to double or triple the price and we couldn't have done anything about it it's a very dangerous thing and we've employed a lot of people and billions of dollars is now flowing into our treasury okay uh yeah in the back bliss blitz\nI'm staying here on on trade the stock market has like the announcement today when we walked in here the Dallas up two hundred and fifty points are so\nThere are some who are worried that because of the threat of future terrorists it could potentially stifle an economy that as hot\nA stock market that hot but yet today you have once again that as it relates to China more terrorists could be coming down the line are you worried that potentially you are somewhat suppressing economy running further\nNow I'm using them to negotiate and hopefully we can make a great deal with China a fair deal and a reciprocal deal but a great deal\nAnd a fair to we have a lot of catching up to do with China you know when they drain us for five hundred billion dollars a year which is probably the real number and that's not including the theft of intellectual property and other things and a lot of people say taught to value but a lot of people say that could be three hundred billion dollars a year\nThat's a tremendous amount you can't let you just can't let that happen [noise]\nNo uh we're using terms very successfully to negotiate and if we're unable to make a fair deal then we'll use errors but Mexico and if you look at Mexico and Canada they're way beyond that we have a deal that really works and the nice part about the deal we make with them\nIs not a specific product it's a product all across the line whether it's dairy or ... you know just a lot of a lot of ... you see the list of products are many many products and they're all imploded so it's across the board\nMr President ... with China one more of it I'm a\nOn Mr President and if the FBI does find something and Brett Kavanaugh foods is there a plan B\nI don't want to talk about plan because I think I Hope that he gets approved I Hope that the report comes out like a ... like I really think it should I think it will I Hope\nI Hope but look I'm waiting just like you certainly if they find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I have a very open mind\nThe person that takes that position is going to be there for a long time\nI have a very open mind I just think is an outstanding person I think he has been treated horribly even if you're going to bring up some of the subjects that were brought up they didn't have to treat him so viciously and so violently as they've treated him\nNot just oh okay All right thank you all very much like

ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend and Paul reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear

I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nWhat I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow look you you can't blame David Brody for being fifty percent informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the drive\nBy media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican doom\nThey can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh's those Republicans guaranteed and lose house of capital not confirmed that production was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold I retracted that predicts you didn't set it could end up being the opposite here\nBut of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more\nA bite on this this uh CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard and Andrew Edgar\nAbout me there's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get Kavanaugh confirmed for the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not Kavanaugh got through I think the whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi TV was on the BBC it was on Russian television I think even a North Korea is\nThe little pot belly dictator mentioned it in his Saturday Night and message to the people it was everywhere\nWith Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to take it into shorts everybody in the media covers it\n[noise] and I again I made that production at a at a time where it looked like they were getting ready to bail\nOn the entire nomination\nAnd when that didn't happen when the Democrats won a couple of steps too far and caused the Republicans do engage them in this than I revise the production\nSo I'm gonna take a brief time out here uh [noise] I've

business channel not not the Fox news channel although I'm sure it'll show up at some point and the kind of run graphic says this source to Fox colon Kavanaugh FBI probe could be wrapped up by Tuesday that\nTomorrow so\nFox News is saying that the capital FBI probably wrapped up by them if it is\n[noise] you can expect that Democrats to go\nStick they're expecting at least ... that's what ... was a short\nI don't know how it is Fox is running it as a source they've got [noise]\nThere's nothing to find the FBI has looked at Kavanaugh this'll be the seventh time folks Christine moving forward does not have any evidence for them to track down she can't even tell them where no walk she can't tell them when they look\nUnless she starts suddenly remembering it now and I guess they would say that that's credible the trauma has awakened repressed memories I put nothing pass them\nBut she can't remember when not even a year she's not even sure of the house in wherever it is and by the way how are you able to draw floor pan for plan of a house and not know where it was\nShe can't tell anybody how she got home she can't tell anybody once he told anybody after the supposedly horrible event happened to her\nWhat ever else she she is not\nCredible the FBI has looked into this guy this is the seventh time if he were a binge drinker as an adult and beating people up and sending them in jail\nThat would have been found long before now so remember none of this is about what it's about this is about the way they'll lay delay delay that's all the Democrats want here\nSo whenever the FBI produces a result and whatever the results are the Democrats have an answer for it\nIf they exonerate cabin on the investigation was not thorough the Trump told the FBI to overlook it much they can they can accuse\nTrump us\nKevin ... of anything and be confident the media will carry the water that allegation\n\nIf the FBI find corroborating evidence was that people are going to have to ask well how come you missed it six previous times over who knows how many years you've been looking into this guy how can you find any evidence which she didn't tell you where to go look\nAll well and and did you talk to Michael ... the FBI\nDidn't talk to his client and it didn't smart to ... I'm telling you no matter how this if the FBI exonerate Kevin all whenever they do it do you really think the Democrats because okay fine but we we we we got what we wanted number prepared to go about do you think that's gonna be the result it will not but [noise]\nNow folks [laughter] one of the thing here [noise]\nWe just had a caller who said that we don't want to become them but it's time to start playing this game the\nWay they do\nI made the point you don't have to become them to beat them at this game we didn't have to become Hitler to win World War two we didn't have to become the Japanese emperor when World War two and the\nPacific theater\nThat's always been a bogus we cannot go after these people want to risk ... coming who they are with Pam what a crock that's nothing more than some limitation that's in other denial of people who are already\nFound to be of a\nScience character you you can you can you can enter into tough battles without losing your morality and your morals character and so forth\nBut as an example of how we own most do it now and then but then we pulled back I call your attention last week the window Lindsey Graham on loaded on the Democrats\nThe on loaded on him and he was a thousand percent right in every allegation he made a couple of other Republicans echoed gram but with no passion and with no energy they just echoed ... grams said\nIntellectually now\nAccording to our caller that should have been the starting point people should have been picked up on grams opener and run with it and it shouldn't be calm\nThe daily identifier of the Republican Party they should have been throwing back firing back right at the Democrats in their faces every hour of every day exactly what Graham did make that the ongoing about put them on the defensive make the media repeat these charges the Graham laid out\nBut instead it was a standalone Graham said it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican\nAnd salt grams impassioned allegation of the Democrats was followed by agreement with Jeff flakes\nTo me that the FBI being allowed to do one more quick but it has to get their fight and all of fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell\nPeople who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're gonna have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated a we shared it with the way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was\n\nGraham didn't have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the way did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of meeting got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care and the only thing got a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys and we know they said they didn't Lincoln Mr German we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they didn't oh what about an investigation huh well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to invest in some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nThere needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired of because all they are for the way\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and his denial\n\nHow why if that's so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility an attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\n\nNow want to go back to my production [noise]\nRate on testing and mitigation concrete leveling repairing replacement one website Scott's rash or deal dot com fourth rash or\nIs your financial plan out of tune listen to news radio eleven ...

be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites\nThese are from the oval office was during a\nAn announcement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminates ... getting rid of it brand new trade deal the drive vice were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA\nStarted entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four\nOf them here and here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin on things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls polls are aren't very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to where I Know it's going to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that ended up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Cuban a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what I'd change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any\nAccusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class and yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ...\nThis whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake demand a week\nFor his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote when before a vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI skull because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump or his I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank you Mr suffered needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a setup and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC's why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI has finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on\nIt will just tell ya if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged and they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels I went to the response as well they found nothing you know a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um\n[noise] audio soundbite number thirty reporter about judge Kavanaugh there are concerns\nMight have lied or mischaracterized as drinking while he was testifying if they find that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking or if he lied about other things do you think that that bars him from being your nominee to the Supreme Court\nSurprised at how vocally was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about\nThings that happened when he drank because this is not a man that said that alcohol was ... that he was perfect with respect to alcohol look at some of these people asking the questions okay look at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no for Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero he fought and died in ...\nProvince we call them ... Richard downing that's his ... he never went to Vietnam take a look at Cory Booker he ran Newark New Jersey into the ground\nHe was a horrible in there and he made statements that when he was in high

the only the headline on the drudgery of all let me read it to your White House expands FBI probably what the hell is that so I clicked on the like here's what it is [noise]\nRight here my formerly Nick at the same fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview anyone necessary for Kevin inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys that that this that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations ... not that fake news so then they've got a record Trump not limiting investigate which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells FBI interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule\nCNN reports that the Democrats have submitted a list of twenty four people they want the FBI to talk to this after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this\nIs is delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nAs somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when whatever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything on like Bob Mueller they stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this somebody on the Senate\nJudiciary Committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing\nFor the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow or letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and or incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute\nWith no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible cabinet was not\n\nSomebody look we had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack them in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus now they're making things up the Trump is going to limit it to eat at no such thing\nBut he sure felt for the bait I Am not limiting and the thing I it's totally FBI to take us wherever it\nTakes them properly Democrats\nWhile here Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI say look there's there's some people in my town here really really screwing approach and I need to get
