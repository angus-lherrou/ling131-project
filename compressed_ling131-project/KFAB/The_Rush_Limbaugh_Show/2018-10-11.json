Mohammed bin some modest the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king solved ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the song or the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused because\nThe world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed does Oman has been doing has been traveling the world and making\nFriends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know each wind and dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys but a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garbage he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky but he represents if\nBeing truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving\nWell to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them open up being able to drive a go places on their own without mail at company but\nThis made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last night it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over the Ritz Carlton\nHotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding\nA certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it\nDo to corruption and connections and storms he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin so I'm On\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it\nThis reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees for example\nJamal ... wanted to get married\nHe had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the hidden supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family\nBecause of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nNow who do you think this guy's going to vote for guys obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and find that this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements that will happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi\nRight here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well\nI'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters democratic voters want revenge not a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... eight Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise] I don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if that's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to do but they just keep doing the same market and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done just stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing and you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's\nThat's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when there are those the right one were silent and they it for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away at\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work again and the only way it works is that we don't show up\nThat's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does it they can discourage ... us enough and they could not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWent every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up to convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in

Donald Trump said Thursday he will weed out individuals in side\nHis administration who he does not like echoing remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it [noise]\n[noise] during a live phone interview Thursday morning with facts and friends are president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington he just trusted members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people he doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... that this is not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get\nTo it I don't want to jump ahead let's go to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams\nSorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump\nCalling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do she said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some\nWe had thousands of people lined up by the time either make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and you know that area obviously has not affected by it we had it under the great control I don't think really\nThe grocery hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up they've expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney general said they go low we kick them and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics to be\nCareful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're going to discuss things safe and for him to make your is a very dangerous day for older was held in contempt by Congress\nOlder when after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled\nThe IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to being talked to like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge or are they would say\nWe strongest term oh we'd denounce rhetoric co authored by a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much oh totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely unilaterally condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I can you better be careful what he's wishing for\nNow the stock market's been kinda see song it's been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced would willingly take a bit of a financial hit\nTo their wealth and businesses primarily their businesses not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there are enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it flies in the face of the Democrats in the media\nTried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave a noble even look at our polling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump has pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's all [laughter] when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression [laughter] it was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money was it was very easy [noise]\nI'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's going along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy is a great performing and growing economies so frightening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates in what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump ... no he may appoint the Federal
