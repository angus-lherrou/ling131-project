trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens why we still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout\nDemocratic victory depends on turnout among millennials one on a farm millennials voted in the last midterm\nWe also got to make sure that we get a paint way before we can get a blue taught we need these women to when they're racist I'm confident but not over confident you asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats are we talking Latino I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so what what she'd do differently she's staying here the Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that well because she has the freedom to say it she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it\nTurns out the Latino are far more supportive of Trump at Republicans than anybody new according to recent\nPolling data that Democrats are done at the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason they're stunned just because they believe that all Latino is should despise anybody who is anti\nIllegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennial thing I think what that's about as voter turnout and she mentions it here everybody talks about the millennials and young people and young people that\nIt just it never ceases to be the case that election day they don't show up they don't show\nUp in the numbers everybody thinks they're going to show up in\nAn every cycle this plays out every cycle we're told the youth vote is fired up this time Mr Limbaugh the youth vote their energetic they're energized they are motivated this is a new day they can't wait and then same old thing happens they don't show up in the numbers that everybody expects them to\nShe's suggesting that that may be the case here the Democrats failed to light a fire\nOn to the Latino thing bother to look at what the Latino think what that actually stands for is immigration\nShe is I I'm I guarantee you like many other Democrats are stunned that immigration remains such a big positive winning issue\nFor Trump and the Republicans and it is it is the issue every Republican running for office eater incumbents or running for the first time needs to be focusing on this issue there is no way it can hurt them\nLet's visit I'm Dave ...\nThe craft a business plan is right for you your business and your family call

say you're wrong I mean I just uh I don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the flight the Democrats' chances and you know the Republicans' chances in the mid term [noise] well uh\nI that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worth\nThere is in in the in the\nQuote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered

like he was doing the exact opposite\nForget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is this it may even be a written the regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentleman lay procedure that the the O.

Jake Tapper any of these others\nDemanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we know it shouldn't affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not well let's play the game let's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's gotta be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on Mahler to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the garden yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to get one T a blue wave\nIf mother doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThey're linking ... or has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think\nThe report says every member they have two years no more than that in a two and a half years of any reporting that Trump and Russia colluded so\nIn their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump Russia collusion happens\nSo Mueller's report is ready to be released soon create the impression that it's only a matter of time now before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nVoting in turn out prior to the mid term Scott I'm just going to tell ya if this report doesn't advance this narrative that Trump cheated and stole the election they're not going to want this up before the midterms you man gyms I'll let\nDown that would be you don't know you don't know how many\nOf your base\nCommon ordinary everyday democratic voters literally believe that Trump won this election by cheating with Russia you'd be done at the number of your fellow Democrats citizens in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco\nIn Chicago who believe it like gospel\nDespite all realm of commonsense\nDespite every\nBit of knowledge we have that there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe ball the Ford\nTheir politics requires that they believe it\nIt's mandates they believe that if they are told before them in terms that the smaller report doesn't have this evidence and will not lead President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\nFace when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in\nThe truth about her allegations I just I just find that to just a little bit hollow as though take your pick ticket they take your pick any left wing or on media\nGriping about Trump's using the word Horst base and ask yourself if that media reporter\nNever talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the ... the presidency\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try\nAll day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters that some of his voters that showed that in fact that there's so much good going on here focusing and don't don't need to distract and everybody with that stuff\nBut he did\nThey're also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh of the journalists in the Saudi conflict is found\nA dramatic a shaggy they're still working on that but\nI think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works and now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to print it yep just cleared the transom here\nUh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better at much higher than anybody on the left and the media wants to add Mitt\nWill continue only V. miss work\nIf you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can consider cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone\nAnd it fits in your pocket you can take an EKG anytime anywhere to order ... cardio dot com K.

tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's\nMore Trump's low numbers are almost entirely\nBecause Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing and that was after\nThe failed pork you was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand gets approval from only\nFive percent of
