Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion\nAnd it's growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just thick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them an entry or to separate the children from the adults\nSo that's a drive by media can then kicked into high gear with stories that are already written that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan already in the can

before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and that it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and decency so we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if Mueller's ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite uh let me find the Pacific refined

being referred to as a lovable little teddy bear\nType guy in the New York times\nThere is now I Know I went through this the other day but I Am continuing to see this is what makes me suspicious of this story folks you know I read my tech blog news I read everything there are still people attempting\nVia they're reporting to suggest that there was a recording\nOf the murder of ... from his apple watch\nMy friends this\nIs item number one but a rousing as my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this inserting on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any\nRelation any any complicity in this story so\nWhoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by the show these apple watch and are now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... and ... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name has been misappropriated and has been falsely accused of reporting this\nIn order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly and here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is el he or cellular signals two years ago when apple and well actually fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they\nActivated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operate it would still get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a ... but he didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch failed to do is just ceased to be a slave to the phone the other two ways or blow to and ...\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch and data can leave a watch you take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate there is only one way that watch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to his wheat by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against\nOther nations being able to monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protection is that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's ... that couldn't happen so he only had a way it would be why\nThat one only work if the wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\nAnd the wife I connection on one\nJust because the phone connects the wife ... when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fi network because the phone it's parents who uses it\nThen like if you're at home you're ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside\nTo walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that he was probably know to do it um\nI don't know that they would give them the password how what do you get the password of the Saudi Saudi consummate wife signed up the idea that that watch was recording whatever happened to the show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud\nIs just so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this they're still\nPushing that that recording existed it somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish officials\nAre doing everything they can to listen to it and make decisions and the sharing of the United states\nThere is a recording of this I'm not denying that ...\nCouldn't easily been a recording that the that the Saudis made themselves but not from to showcase watch that just it I don't see how in the world given the technological limitations\nThat could be but they continue to push that\nNow the balance of this story is being used to tarnish\nPresident Trump but I'll tell you how successful it is I'll tell you ... I got an email today\nFirst thing this morning from a good\nFriend of mine whose name you wouldn't know but I Can't tell you is he wants anonymity and privacy you would know who this person is a famous world known athlete\n[noise]\nAnd he is constantly emailing people proof of various acts committed by the left that he thinks people should know but he's one of us [noise]\nHe said Russia I don't feel good about this I think Trump's on the verge of blowing this whole ... thing if he doesn't come down on the right side of this it could mean everything\nAnd you know was evidence was Thomas Friedman column in the New York times said rush I Know that you wouldn't Friedman have uh have have relationship but this guy knows more than anybody else about the middle east and this is not good for Trump\nThey've got to do something about the ... say well this is how the ... this is how seductive this stuff could be this guy that I'm Talking about is as knowledgeable as anybody else on who the left is and how they operate and here he was sucked in by a Friedman column today\nAnd there was one element of the fried Friedman column that I think got him and then this treatment by the way has a point in this but it's not ...\nIt's it's\nThere's another thing you hear about the Saudi reformers [noise] they are joining us in opposition to Iran and they also Mohammed bin Salman started the war in Yemen has not been popular\n[noise] um and that all of this is happening in Turkey where Recep hey yeah oh no one is also Muslim Brotherhood and all solved and the turkey has a NATO ally but this guy or to want is not\nOne of our big buds he is is a militant Islamic once the caliphate wants wants at all and that\n... himself is Muslim Brotherhood and\nHe's probably more of a jihad us than he is a journalist\nA lot of this box that is just not readily apparent on the surface\nBut it's trying to be simplified vibe a drive by media to make it look like\nA\nThe Trump administration's somehow is complicit it missed because they will not joining the rest of the world and condemning Saudi Arabia for this here's an here's my mom pomp pay out this morning outside the White House soundbite number one\nHe was speaking to reporters about the meeting that they'd had a with Trump to brief him\nI've told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do have a complete understanding of the facts surrounding that which one we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to the surrounding Mr joking\nWhen I ... and met with President here to want to talk to me about the incident he told me that they were conducting their own investigation so we do believe that between these two Africans a complete picture will emerge for what actually transpired here\nYeah so well everybody else has drawn the conclusion everybody else the Saudis dismembered him fifty and hit men showed up they cut him apart while he was alive and they got some mercy and get him some drugs to knock him out there to put on the head ... listen to music while they finish the job [noise]\nUh and that that's what supposedly has happened to our side yet will not fall in line with that version of the story and that's the rub or the media's concern why\nWon't come to some of these so called the dollars that the Saudis no reason that\nIt's just more of the same just gotta wait Rush Limbaugh lay out fascinating ... that we're\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well may take cigars for example the details are what matter same goes for simply saint palm security\nTheir attention to detail and craftsmanship makes simply say system truly different from everything else out there it's easy to set up and it's easy to use and it works in the power outages are downed wires because there aren't any of those and there are no contracts get ten percent are simply say usa dot com that's\nSimply safe usa dot com\nHi I'm ... owner of blind stirred dot com you know I made my life's mission to convince everyday people that measuring it installing custom lines is one of the easiest do it yourself projects there is check out our new no tools sailor shades the first and only shades installed without any screws or tools you heard me right customs shades\nButter in stone without any tools I guarantee your body will fit around remake the free of charge you only pay shipping save up to fifty percent off any order just under the code Russia checkout lines to dot com that's blinds T.
