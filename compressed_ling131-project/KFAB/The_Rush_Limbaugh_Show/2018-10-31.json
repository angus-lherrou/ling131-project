that report it\n[noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\n\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you got the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in the story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea\nI don't care what Paul you look at I don't care what professional here talk to I don't care what grade really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can break either way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day though the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that hard to trust nobody knows a lot of blood\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good world do you know why I think it was was it two thousand fourteen\nTwo thousand twelve was one of those two elections were Nate Silver luck into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat won the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he is intolerable\nSince that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver distaste than when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat canal say packet us in the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll only does this analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poll either the polling company he's never run a campaign and condos flight was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nTo guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be true and so it becomes a group and the media continues to cite this was like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blonde vi\nAnd become flat line\nAnd it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd in some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump ... and the er the birthright citizenship\nToday the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's totally constitution no it isn't and he got Republican leaders that we don't

of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon lemon lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN\nAnd its noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another hate filled criminal just last week in Kentucky and other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon what is your reaction to this I mean the folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holes but the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned as white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perversion view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from\nThe traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence to the primary example are exhibit of their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the\nSteps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan immigration policy you name it [noise]\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what a great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be right medic continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they are all\nWays the result of environmental things and so I went to the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day\nIf you're gonna if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who isn't that isn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite and since these\nPeople are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group look in the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people

has a habit and that is is assuming\nAnd then operating on the assumption that whenever they fake and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks or everybody cares about well I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf the momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline that wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Fort Myers\nYeah Ford myself ounces of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies plan between now and election day you've got all the way up\nTo the night before the election and he's pumping a series of themes

confidence consumer confidence in the economy [noise]\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his

doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his\nAttitude\nOr anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this I\nYou hear that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis is ... you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on election day and I don't believe anybody else does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe in the ... not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close to me that we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nIt's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul Ryan why\nIsn't why isn't it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great piece today\n[noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations\nWe had balls the foreign with her allegations whatever cabin on there that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any\nBut the media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named the Supreme Court he is the passes it gets ... got the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rates serial rapists where is all it just it's going on is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political stunt\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed and the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there's a big campaign going Kevin all of us have been rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about capital of a stir it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy make laying eyes to terrify do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents\nThey still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week if not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot to wait to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all of okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost in their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost and their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the Kavanaugh confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused

writing my class was of course because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph what most people don't understand is one needs and millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way if Democrats want it now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nEspecially looking at their eyes they take a device him like open up the upper eyelids and if you had a disease called ... coal mine\nYou will automatically let go\nThey made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that now wants to ship doctor perform his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing that trick coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you are set back the ship had to\nPay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any one that caught not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you realize\nThat what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God American was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets\nThen I heard the streets with tape with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page in the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people we want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it or we will have a lot of that is not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shut it to think about kind of history he's going to be learning it so I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books\nOh wow very was hurt\nI think that where's he going to get it going to learn it from his own history buffs all revised they get even a paragraph too late\nBenjamin Franklin home I'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver at\nBoston University at Boston University way back in the nineties\nDid a survey and the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in an American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard's in as a textbook writer as a as a as a as quite as I socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so\nOver Thirty years in one white thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice Alice I not only by the way we are they checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nAnd we were much newer and younger country then and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly\nThe immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game standing ovation and I said to myself well it's all over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any call aspect to movies gives most of the fact that there was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that

propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes now let's

what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted

two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen and if you remember the bottom fell out we didn't just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court the Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was Don ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here a piece\nFrom a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their poll analysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day\n\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out to four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final\nStretch and I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\n\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting to a certain degree\nOkay so here he says and the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups\nCould be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states in the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words and on this trend days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of\nUndecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr\nPrint day here is we don't know he's given his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... ... you can think of where it might not turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval it is also\nUnclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative quality of penny as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests but what about the nineteenth\nRepresentative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot\nSo Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here leads to reexamine things [noise]\nAnd then the next burger how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been the massive influx of money and to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenging Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable aren't the ... thing and then the next ...\nAre we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people have voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so what's going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story what else is working out very well that's\nProbably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh them we don't however no\nHow big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of surprises regardless of whether that happens\nWe are well set up for such an eventual out on the bottom line I happen to live is the idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing
