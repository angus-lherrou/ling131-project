the Democratic party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActing on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous as they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton according to draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some aimed coming out the proper up by the elbows but\nSeriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy envy\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed it upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made a speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it\nJoe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons the daily wire has the story Washington Power couple\nBill and Hillary Clinton announced

ready for this political race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either family or leaning in the Democratic column\nNine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control\nThis is what you were just telling me right and you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe is okay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling David [noise] two hundred eight team is the number of seats you need for the majority\nIn the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTo resign seats firmly are leading Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor just the ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans and I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington to live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their weight and if there is no blue wave\nI don't think there's gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo Hungary nine feet firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this got with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election night through thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right\nWell as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started Lee says he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that it's getting\nHarder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching you know you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and\nAnd uh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know no no officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two sides that are\nAm having them\nAnd the cops we bought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the civil that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for it the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching a stupid show and I see a guy who any under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a ways I hero because he is rounding up kids that Trump separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancelled law and order and you're SUV get rid of that had been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo you really\nYou think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House seats coming up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating family [noise] [noise]\nWell [noise] uh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night services it's a lot of Republican retirements what yeah committee chairman are retiring cause their term limited\nForty three members are retiring some of them are committee chairmen and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got attention of TV Time\nYou know you matter but when you turn a limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and you're part of your time

come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was a nominated a guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and order brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me\nAnd basically I tried to assault me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adams senator stop and I was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and\nThe cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun\nBut I went in the house at night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn or assaulted by John Tower um\nBut but you know she
