all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every now they're saying\nThat what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no no it was not abused that doesn't qualify me too because she was an adult\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer of herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's under cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be barking on what\nA stadium chore or yes bill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if Trump can do what they can do it if Trump can do and anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the ... factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly

know what does\nIt like this is like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart man's\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave her radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show or who had never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was on ... and inaugurated as the Democrat that was going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it\nNever has happened every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up to get the kind of\nCrowds and the one that you may think rush them enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't drop ... campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones where we're big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the

I'm confident not overconfident if you asked me today what would I Do differently in terms of Democrats would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so why would she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why she's saying that well because she has the freedom to say that she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it\nTurns out Latinos are far more supportive of Trump at Republicans than anybody know according to recent polling\nData that Democrats are done\nAt the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason they're stunned just because they believe that all Latino is\nShould despise anybody who is\nAnti illegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennial thing I think what that's about as voter turnout and she mentions of here everybody talks about the millennials and young people and young people that\nIt just it never ceases to be the case that
