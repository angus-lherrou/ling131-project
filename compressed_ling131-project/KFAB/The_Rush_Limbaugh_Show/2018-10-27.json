Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military now and they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated

may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes to point\nOut what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this and wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and four of you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nAre being driven stole my by a motion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\n\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing in\nThe next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't tell me to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months\nThey go all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls that the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing Trump of the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousand fixing the germs the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue wave was going to happen\nAnd we have that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through September of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look maybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it ever been CNN zone poet forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth\nI e election day people have to start reeling in these mad and kept for addictions projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business is they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all that's the case who hire them\n\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways the Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house\nForeign ways they could lose the house with a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold outs now all of a sudden\nYou ... your your ... he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he can't this is an ... what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside after seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms I joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood Russian I Hope you and your family's all good and I said this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because they\nI don't care if you're a militarized just the border they if they bomb rushed the border like it down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back in the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or to wipe pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military dollar they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is about the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can't try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but on the line get them on a bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a

I don't find myself losing sleep over it\n[noise] the difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nWhether they love are merely tolerating comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer\nFactory hand the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife leftist intellectuals I Know say they dislike such people in so far as they tend to be conservative Republicans\nThat's true and that's a large group of people to hate that's a larger group of people to dislike but by the way\nThe Senate ... this candidate running for the Senate and Arizona against Martha Sally Sally she is running or we dredged up sound of her back some years ago claiming that housewives or just leeches\n... women who are housewives and stay home and a racist lynching off their husbands this is the kind of thing go Lerner is talking about here that the left resent Americans who find a way to be happy in life even if it violates\nThe left thinks people should be doing Hillary Clinton\nMorocco bombing no they're real sense they know how appalling such people are what they're stupid guns and their loads of some churches they have no money or permanent grievances to make them interesting and no Twitter followers to speak up they skipped Davos every year they watch Fox News or Fox News not\nEven the very best of these people has the dazzling\nBrilliance of a Chuck Schumer not to mention of a shuttle Bob in truth nice people that support Trump or don't dumb as sheep\nMr Trump\nReminds us through the average American really is not the average of male American the average white American we know for sure that come twenty twenty intellectuals would be dumbfounded at the number of women and blacks who will vote for Trump\nHe might be real lining the political map plane average Americans of every type versus fancy ones\nIt goes on with more description to detail that average people\nAre exactly the problem you Jim Jim Acosta nailed it\nI hate seeing these people cheer I hate it\nJeff Flake the problem with Trump is that people don't follow it and the people who believe that that would be you this is what it really boils down to Fox the never Trump or is the latest in Washington they're real problem is you know and they're real problem is elections that you'll get to participate in that's the big threat\nAs far as they're concerned do not doubt me on\nMaybe they don't know the friendly to the military you hire military members in fact you run it in a word we yeah we we have a significant\nCommitment to the military and recently we're very proud we won the freedom award which is the single biggest awards in a civilian employer can went from\nThe department of defense for support of military men and women specifically I'm In the guard and reserve and their spouses so every year there's you know a few thousand companies nominated for this more than they only a hundred and Fifteen and it's a lifetime achievement award so we can't win that again but we're excited to have it in our lobby right now displayed we've got a fleet of trucks\nThat support various causes that we find near and dear to my heart and so we have the freedom fleet that is representative of the United states military and there's about ten freedom trucks out there on any given day fully wrapped I'm supporting our men and women and and the armed forces [noise]\nUm we have a first responder trucks\nAre so it's colder here operation hero truck or ... that is honoring those in the new firefighters pleased at cetera for the work they do and then recently we've actually ruled out to a Susan G combing trucks that are full wrapped\nRepresentations of those that are battling cancer and kind of a race for your\nMom and they travel the country and do you know speaking events and supportive and some go to different races to be displayed it's just kind of a you know we're fortunate with a three and a half a million miles traveled daily [noise] we've got these rolling billboard that we can kind of message on matters of important since we want to use them all\nAnother CEO use you know thing for me you know more of al ... and thank you were listening to this hard Omaha radio station\n[noise] and your smart speaker for him about his newsletter and traffic may serve clean and safe place K. F. A. me fine I highway yeah\n[noise] you're\nListening to Russia's weekend review okay time not against the foreigners at once again I sincerely appreciate everybody holding on we're going to start in a violent Ohio David Europe first that I hire\nIraq's thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening\nTo NPR and Steve I ate a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order Johnson the stench of snow bad it's making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use one at whatever it is to them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster that there's you know thousands of the other line went on they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh\nYour conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\nAfford it got bad we've got a a a a bad connection here\nAbout the only time I've interested in NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said\nOh for the audience and and that happens like at the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA lot of course NPR's not tend to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar torn\nPoverty and the violence in what I mean\nAnd I just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day assigning believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human being I guess it does have a decent life you know in in in in ... and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an insult base screw with Trump Trump's Hitler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to\nFlood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened that we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge ...\nRamos or whatever is it what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it your ... right\nHe's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking\nI don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you want to run in to\n[noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for him he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want\nLife and that we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all have\nThese various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how would the world can this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him that these are\n... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people and to tell his audience who they all are and why we owe them and why we need to open our borders to that\n\nWas just silly and it just illustrated the political nature of this and the objective and the objective is to do great damage to the United states the objective here is harm to\nThe United states and our people that's exactly what this caravans purpose\nIs this\nIs an invasion isn't a caravan in calling the mob if you want but is a is a full fledged invasion of what I like about it in one sense is that it\nIt is\nA microcosm of what's been going on every day for years people flooding the border getting in becoming illegal aliens in the process with no stopping them\nOr when you mentioned stopping them all hell breaks loose and they make\nStick together on the phones here Omaha Chris great to have you on the ... id network hello\nHi Russ for taking my call you bet hey I'm the point I Want to make\nHis earlier talking about the headlines 'em all talking about how Trump was a liar and how he's trying to stoke the fears those headlines are hugely disappointing um and they also make me very angry\nUm I I kind of remember for eight years when Obama was president I I was little uncomfortable and I didn't really care for how the media just plug every policy he wanted to push was the greatest thing since sliced bread and and now all of a sudden you know they're turning the tables\nOn Trump and saying that everything he does is completely wrong but I I Do understand why the liberals or someone who's just because while as long as Trump's president every day they're going to be reminded by the media of all the things that the media wants them to be reminded of about out where Trump is\nNot worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense it may as well because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put yourselves\nIn their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times out Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has the gods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\n\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop drop in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\n\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked ... it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance are Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really don't\nThrow Russia's always at work and but he

doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise] um I actually think all candor that what's going on barring a the\nRevelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on your your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you\nIf all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working\nWhat could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt is brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment that's all they've got and so if none of that work\nIf all of that backfired and ball leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you can not believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it okay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average\nAll of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls and political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top\nOf here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing\nNot there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half states which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an hour or two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it [noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sent an email that I received\nA lawsuit but I've been able to have it there was just this morning\nAnd I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them\nBut I just want to share with your some of the things I get some of that is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me a into promoting whatever it is that I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passion Italy this guy\nWho is it a story and who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone\nJust not as well known as he looks at things here is an absolute red wave and he did not\nBelieve this until last night he has been seeing trends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to\nConvert into these trends that there was actual prediction until now he says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is crazy ring the whole Democratic Party now Amy ... is in a seven point race she was not too long ago in a in a\nIn a landslide victory situation that\nWas so secure and that she wasn't even going to have to spend any money now her lead is down to seven housley is only down three\nThe governor's race two points in the eldest and\nKeith Ellison who is crater ring looks like he's going to lose by more than seven points and this guy says he's getting reports him on the ground in Minneapolis and throughout the state that Randy areas are turning out in droves once again Republican early voting is through the roof\nAnd nobody predicted this the Democrats own early voting and the Republicans so far\nOn it and all over the country it looks like and this was a stunt or this is something people have not seen and nobody predicted this in Nevada Dean Heller now on track to win by thirty five thousand votes California thirty nine California forty eight California forty nine absentees all three seats\nWould be safe Antonio Sabato is up or two points in his district for California's even got places pockets\nWhere Republicans are looking good Arizona Republicans up over Democrats twelve point four percent that's up three point nine percent over two thousand sixteen the ah Arizona won a Democrat seat is now close all of these thought to be Democrats locks just a month ago are now toss ups\nAnd this guy says to me I think we're in a position here to actually gain a couple of house seats maybe seven to nine Senate seats\nAt this rate if these kinds of trends and it's all based on polling data continues now you might be as Russia was this guy here in this anywhere I Know you're not hearing it anywhere that's the point\nIt doesn't matter what is the fact that I'm are laying it to you is all you need to know that that that I'm taking it somewhat seriously ... at least to the point that it's interesting I'm not endorsing any of this folks I don't I'm not familiar enough with the data myself\nWe see each I help get to be associated with something that is positive and that is health field if you think about it health care providers typically you don't think about us until you're scared and injured in sick this for us gives this opportunity to continue to advance our mission which is about creating health in our community in different ways\nBut you know the other thing for us that was important as we\nThrough the process of deciding whether or not\nThis was something we wanted to pursue was that we were actually contributing to the city the money that we pay for this agreement not only allows the city to avoid having to packs a it's taxpayers or should there be shortfalls but also provides resources to the city to continue to upgrade and improve what I Believe is a\nCrown jewel not only of the of the city of Omaha but of the reason it's unique there as far as I Know there's no other health system like ours that has this kind of relationship but I Believe it's also telling great to the community and spray farming say\nWhat are some of the things that maybe people wouldn't think the C H I help is involved in in the community\nStock probably are are most visible community benefit is that we provide care to those are the most unfortunate in our community those that have the least resources those that don't have\nGood insurance to cover all the costs some the care they need so that is the thing that's always top on our list that is part of our mission which is to serve everyone in the community with particular focus on those that are most in need we have now over four thousand different individuals\nThat have participated from I think a hundred and Seventy different organizations specifically around the topic of behavioral health and we do that 'cause it is so important to the community and it's part of a\nTo another CEO use you know thing for me you know hard in our community and thank you were listening to this hard Omaha radio station\nWhat else can your smart speaker for Nebraska news weather and traffic makes sure he's clean and say play chaos hey be on a higher rate yeah [noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's weeks in reviews are quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] excuse me have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how are they are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterms the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what are the Clinton and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nation wide stadium chore\nThird team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what what\nIf there isn't a whole lot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale at every event here yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in the Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft troubling as phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now at Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with somebody left just tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hate and so much anger their life in America it's not safe it just it's just too packed it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is [noise] uh we'll see we'll let time on fall here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Roger ... if you if there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very much\nRush you know it's a you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that we have a dangerous strains right we're out here putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq who said oh\nYeah that that information just not out there for the masses of pain you know\nThere was never any attempt to use devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right on me to point\nFingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered the Democrats\nThey've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to the real Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nGoing along along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\n\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around would\nIt make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way they thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this\nThis is not going the way they have assured us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there is a big blue whale based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the ah the Swedes here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump's just do opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are\nIllegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we've we know from a couple of sources\nThat Venezuela sponsored and paid for it is if that if that's true then Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nAnd a lot of people in our side have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if in Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela that's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates unless those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this button because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us a mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving engaged demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhatever not say all this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city":
