this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard there but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like that or an infant didn't want it to last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared that when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got\nTheir show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that led the ... they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if\nThis caravans allowed to get to

doubt is the right word but they would be my only disappointment particularly after Trump has\nStop them or let them in as anybody we haven't seen that yet we haven't seen it because they haven't

can\nI Can't say the number of people rush it's possibly come with trying to you can't sit in the military to ask you this is an invasion\nThis is a foreign invasion whether they're armed or not some of them no doubt are the U.S military is perfect we can send military anywhere on our borders to deter any invasion military or otherwise\nNot violating the law here at the exactly what this is and it

is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them we're also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the\nThe details on that story are from the uh oh here's one from NBC\nAnd they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes\nLast night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes deployed\nOut what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nWho right mind would want this who in their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat\nEveryone but motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and four of you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals but in the world\nIs so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough\nTo know what's best are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have a border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world\nCome on in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers [noise]\nAnd so the Democrat Party is siding with [noise] the people around the world who have nothing [noise] who think that because the United states has a lot [noise]\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost\nAs an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are\nPromoting it defies common sense to support this\nFrankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't for somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't been here for a long time\nBut there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing Trump of the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is that Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually in midterms the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue wave was going to happen\nAnd we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through September of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look maybe it won't be as big a blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN zone poll forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I\nEat election day people have to start reeling in these Madden cat for veterans projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business there\nIn the polling business is they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign\nThis is it about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always\nTrying to get in\nEither way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour well\nIm sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics I don't care if you're a militarized border if they\nBomb rushed the border like it down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or tear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nHouse and Senate back in the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down today started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is the best people plan this thing\nExactly and that's where it can't try to deal with this on his own she needs to put everybody else's but I'm a little I get 'em on bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be

to have you how you doing sir don't get how are you sir fine and dandy great to have you on the program today\nHey great if I talk to your call screener and what I see is probably Democrat Party strategically because they had a problem and twenty sixteen spandex came out and voted for Trump looked at one of them do [noise] I've seen some stories they aren't going to do at the time because the pocketbook issues and making good money taxes are lower jobs\nSo if you're part of a whole thousands and thousands of people on that border and start buying the storage we're talking about where the suffering there's no food there's this thing is that you're looking at people who are the candidate banger country man maybe extended nieces and nephews\nYou go to the polls that week beforehand and look at it was darn worried about the oil level I think is there a guilt them with their strong sense of family I daddy into coming back to the party even though they know in their own interest this vote Republican\nOkay All right so let's let's let's walk through this\nIf I understood correctly you would think that this is a Democratic Party operation\nBecause the Democrats are having problems with Hispanic turnout that happens to be true\nIt happens to be that more ... and this is this is a presidential approval polling numbers\nHispanics and African Americans are rating Trump's performance higher than anybody ever in their wildest dreams imagined it would be an in pre election polls the panic vote is trending Republican more than anybody ever thought it would be the Democrats are panicking over this\nAnd so if your rights than what they've done is put together this caravan\nOf Hispanics and Latinos hoping\nTo show how they are mistreated so that the Hispanics trending for Republicans\nWill change their mind and not vote Republican because these people will not be allowed in where\nIs it written and the other but I go to where is it written that every

the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in and how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did\nIt would put the lie to the notion of all the

is not how decent people behave\n\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democrats' side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook these are people in

number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten

a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrat leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on

whether it's a benefit the Florida or not but\nThe Santas would be great defense as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump\nA but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing it and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got

have have are\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\n\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has\nBeen made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe wave stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what\nReason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is deported\nBecause he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob\nSeven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever else is\nGoing on it's still boils down to an age is old argument\nOver philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content\nOn your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish the Democratic party has become a party of groups\nVictims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of ... means spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way\nI mean this is just hands down at nist Andrew Gillum personify is personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put\nBut one of these up on the digital cameras are watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ... I don't know where this was a chance to go just grab some pictures here on the fly to break at the top of the hour there are people standing single file on the second floor it is it looks like in the next picture you'll see just act like a high school\nGym and nobody's there and Joe Biden is the big draw and\nGive them is sitting there with somebody else they're watching vitamin speak and there's no excitement in his room there's nothing anywhere near what happens if a Trump rally but these people believe that ... is the answer\nThey believe by the answer to Trump at ... am not kidding you've

till you can see them at our website I'm actually a\nTiny stage with Biden and give them there on the left is you're looking at it\nBut look at how how narrow the main floor is and how how few rose the the sides are and that's it and the Democrats the media just like they're not reporting the crowd size at Trump rallies and particularly the people that can't get in\nThey're not talking about how few people are showing up at rallies lead and inspired by Joe Biden\nAnd I I'm telling you both of these are seriously under reported stories purposely this is the kind of crowd that you'll see at a party that's not like nothing fires under I mean we we're hearing about how the Democrat\nBased so motivated so inspired the Democratic base and affect the American people showing hate Trump they can't read the voter enthusiasm the media's told the enthusiasm and the energy is all the Democrats ... well you can't get\nAnywhere you look where there wouldn't be evidence\nOf it there isn't and where there is evidence of massive energy massive desire massive expectations is on the Trump side and Trump happens to be on the Republican side and\nHe's doing these rallies in tiny places other
