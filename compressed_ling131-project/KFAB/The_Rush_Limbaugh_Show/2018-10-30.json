to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere and yet\nWe have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs\nNow that are heading across southern may go\nWith their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just is just being John Doe upset Trump's base that the ... people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic\nExpression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remains supportive of\nDonald Trump but back we'll get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave rush I listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but\nLet me let me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning\nYou know retiring because they don't want to go back to being jumps you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are known as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways loses seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigning resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and\nThey are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump and know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking the job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\nMy forecast for the twenty Eighteen congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nAs your way around her mind great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic in critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era\nThat I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement reading pill movement\nAnd the great awakening movement and he goes on\nTo describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red pill\nA movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mailed bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in\nIn the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive buys with like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations\nUh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats in the media think it\nIs a problem\nThere's talk all over Twitter that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these\nThese events these falls surprises he calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump or we have the October surprises the usually the caravan of crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of\nThese wells are prizes and other events while intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans were holding the house all of the above surprises and events have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating a building and blue wave with a red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded\nBlue wave you by the way this is what you want a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue wave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and it's not that's not a blue\nWave a blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look\nPossible they're gonna they're gonna win the Senate they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about um reality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and it turned out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away but I think inclusion isn't there has been no blue way there's not even been a blue ripple back you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blow bubbles are bursting recall the blow bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal cities so this guy is of the ...\nHikers Baker here for

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together by the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the reverence the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who want to literally rip it up throw it away and establish is on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason\nIt make it up while it was stolen Russia's this or that it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him have been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that\nIn junior high intramural football and softball nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kid the hit until you hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two is five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart in school were gonna slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been teaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not\nPrepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses and we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election of that is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not win\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth when it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't until they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good and when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ... Facebook ad comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein\nThis is from what I'm calling to news civility and alleged tone it down stack\nThe Democrats and the left and the drive by telling everybody we need to tone it down they told Trump you need to tone down their rhetoric dude you're causing all these people engage in violence Trump said I thought I had gone to down if you need me to turn it back up I Will they went bonkers\nSo here comes the left wing billionaire Tom ...\nWho is one of his environmentalist wackos\nWho hopes to make a killing him this this fraudulent hoax of man made climate change dire is running a Facebook ad campaign comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein the ad features a three minute long video that accuses the president of following dictator's playbook\nModeled by tyrants like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Kim Jong only in North Korea as well as Saddam Hussein ... describes Trump as a malignant narcissistic\nAnd claims he is perpetuating says yeah make\nMassage the\nVideo claims that Trump's support for a border wall and attacks on the media make him comparable to dictators\n\nDictators not attacked the media they own the media\nDictators don't spend their time ripping the media because they are the media\nTrump visited dictator [noise] not even close to it seems like only yesterday\nVanessa drive buys are blasting Trump for tweeting that dire comes off as a craze stumbling alone [laughter] yet here he is\nWashington Post yesterday Trump mocks Democrat mega donor Tom's dire the target of a pipe bomb and stumbling lunatic and now here comes Tom's dire bumbling along like a lunatic comparing Trump Trump to a bunch of tyrants\nJeff Flake said yesterday but it's on the white clean Trump will change his rhetoric but elected officials shouldn't call him out\nAnd his supporters as being out of bounds you elected officials they'll continue to appear what the president at rallies where lock her up chants are encouraged and routine and phrases like the president is using I can imagine\nAs an elected official attending a rally like that and not stand up afterwards will be for him to say don't do this don't do this\nFlight was on Arizona NPR stations on Monday

you here\nThat get rash I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of section one an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are running the miss impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's a\n... ... it it it's we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet right 'cause what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhat you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they teach sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth unlimited abolish slavery well the southern states worked in ... so they passed laws are closed up we're still restricted the plaques\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the dose coach or a polished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made us why you shouldn't\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten joking first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in ah in neighborhoods are Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ...\nDitto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct than you\nAmerican culture which is rooted in\nWestern civilization that's what's different now there is no interested in that [noise] we don't even make a serious effort have assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be re establishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we are going to come together and we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up as\nBeing said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you have to share that with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their languages it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that now Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nI don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones in El Salvador or Guatemala\nUh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political\nClimate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... and\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet but\nI understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world and otherwise\nYou know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise] I look\nNo eyes or George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind\nSomebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states the purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on

going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we

Bengali and\nI Am telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own\nI'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in the presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other but you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh dab criticized made fun of mocked\nBut you were never given any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected\nWhen you think what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto it not because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been ... can tell you how to think or tell your window go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down to you know what I keep the essence of things that keeps\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied\nYours the reason that this is all going 'cause you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now you're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity\nAre you a man facing divorce if so listen carefully divorce affects all areas of your life financially emotionally and mentally\nIt changes the relationship with your children perhaps even more than you think my name is Joe ... and I know how hard divorces because I've been there myself are from works hard to protect the interests of man during the process\nWe represent men like you who want to protect their financial interests and the relationship that they have their kids everyone involved in a divorce has affected by the breakup of the family\nCourt Allen Cordell tries to help you through this tough time so that then you can move on with your life\nContact their domestic litigation from of course Dylan\nCordell to schedule an appointment with one of our firms Nebraska or Iowa attorneys support their men can count on for zero to five zero one Ninety eight hundred online at Cornell Cornell dot com that's Cordell Cordell dot com core deli Cordell won\nThree three four zero California street suite two hundred Omaha Nebraska six eight one five for\nWell the families coming back home for the holidays it's time to get the hospice stepping ready for all of our visitors now I Need a man left and a ladder to hang up all of our Christmas lights decoration\nAll the floors and to be clean up to half of the wood floor thing to get ...

Arab being caught on exchange flashed by [noise] disasters don't plan ahead but you can talk to your loved ones about making an emergency plan gets started today and ready dot Gov slashing planned brought to you by FEMA and the ad council\nAnd your smart speaker for the newsletter and try and make sure you please and say play pay us say be signed I hardly [noise]\nI'll let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] to comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most recent caller\nI lost her when she is how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard what she was talking about her definition gas light\nA I got an ... her point was that the Democrats the media can get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything and what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what happened and that that that has been my point that's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media ... my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act the needy I hated it\nWas in response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to bake a cake for your reception I my religion does allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along an act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots what refuse\nTo bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along pants is the governor the media was outraged and they began to report on this\nAs though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out\nPost of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude and all things that they do wear what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the tickets are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it\nAnd then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses would you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for why they were and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman\nA running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against them so they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana Mitt\nAnd she was just answering their questions naively and innocently she was just trying to be honest with them she thought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting it went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand and the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats\nAt federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for that they are being rejected\nAnd the media is being rejected as as well\nAnd so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is al heartily endorse it and er and accept it and it's this arrogance\nAnd just the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have\nThe synagogue shooting obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump is conservative\nMedium posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSplit numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you is isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our sides still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst it ah to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
