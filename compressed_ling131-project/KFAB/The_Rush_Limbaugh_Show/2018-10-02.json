Rush Limbaugh executing assigned host donated flawlessly as is the case [noise]\nEach and every busy broadcast day [noise]\nOkay for those of you watching on the\nDental cam I Want to show you something for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's no camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nAre but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that when it first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentlemen was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at least some local talk shows but\nCNN is the only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh are they really conservative website just start everything's starting to to to to block it at that point but but this program nationally we're still at four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up\nThe uh building in Oklahoma City federal building and of course uh I I\nWas living in it was not going to accept that would challenge the White House on and they issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio\nMichigan Militia shortwave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio is is that by the way this more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so as a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht\nI think it was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine gutted the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\n\nWell one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford and judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of just ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back\nSome public at the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other digital camera this is the cartoon and it has Kevin ... daughter praying at her bedside\n\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer and in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see it\nI'm not doing this is that come on for membership I'm I'm just we\nHave the ability to show these things rather than to describe them same cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's\nJust vital it's filthy if dirty in disgusting it's despicable and it's sick and of course it has accomplished it's objective it's gone viral and people have seen that people are reacting to it\nAnd I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets an I decided to go ahead and do it in my never ending\nQuest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabin on his daughter says another prayer dear God forgive\nMy angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just that flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\n\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in their lives of suffered psychological just of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nAnd and the American left psychological disorders have become the identifying issue isn't characteristics of this party\n\nAnd they are attempting to become the majority on the basis of the psychological disorders which you're always somebody else's fault the disorders they suffer or simply said to be their political positions\nAnd their anger is that the country or specific groups like white man who need to die so that feminist can cast rate the corpses and feed them to pigs Georgetown University professor Dr Christine fair I mean these people are\nClearly not all there\nOkay you can now take that off of the switch or and return me to the digital camera thank you got\nFrom Breitbart News Mazie Hirono senator Hawaii FBI needs to investigative Kevin was a very belligerent aggressive drunk\nAnd re metro NBC News in Washington\nSays that senator Geraldo said that

talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finished this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know\nAll the details yet but clearly if they have been given a free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham\nInvestigation I also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday of really put the effort into it\nNow wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have grab audio soundbite number eight\nThis is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtles in and basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth\nJust yesterday NBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring yourself\nAnd that means he's not quite on what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is nasty throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nIt's a a liar their flailing but Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of

found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak Dr foreigners letter to Dianne Feinstein\nYou know this this is of leaking this letter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about him and said that she had it since July and that she told us all about\nIt that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to

whole demeanor and her body language I it was just stole rehearsed and coached um\nAll all from from the way she she acted behind the microphone like she had never seen one before in her life\nHer voice was quivering and I I don't mean to sound cruel but I mean that was I Can't believe that you know an intelligent and well educated world traveler public's faith or a microphone and act like it's\nLike she was just\nThe most frail little Wilton flour and the world you\nKnow you know we had I didn't I didn't get to this yesterday I had a an audio cell by the\nHollywood actress or an actress somewhere that I've never heard of did a video impersonation of Dr Ford and it was so spot on it it was exactly uh what what I noticed her speech pattern those of us whose profession involved with a boys\nKnow very well uh the various vocal techniques that professional vocalizing views and she used to a great effect what is called up talking or up speaking and that means the end every sentence on an up note\nIt promotes the idea that your young and innocent and vulnerable and it's what you say was that the little girl type voice\nThis Hollywood actress in a perfect impersonation and is being destroyed she put it on Twitter she'd being destroyed she had to apologize for it and tell her body she supports not to report she just was amazing she wanted to do or impersonation to show her talent but it got taken down and I didn't get a chance to get to the video\nThat maybe we can drop from yesterday's archiving and play it for you but it's it's a perfect illustration of of ah\nHow she speaks I have to tell you something to him on you're not the only woman who doesn't believe her the female prosecuted Republicans hired\nA Rachel Mitchell has put together a devastating forensic analysis of Dr Ford's testimony and it is and I've got that here but it prints out the eight pages\nI mean there's there's no way I can I mean I guess I could share various excerpts of it with you [noise] um but I mean it is just devastating on the substance forget the way she spoke and how she appeared and so forth a and the the Democrats are acknowledging\nAs well this decision
