whole lot of information but of course important if you're from the president after a national story of this size bed so to back to Rush Limbaugh now a news radio eleven ten K. obeyed the Republicans\nAre going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are [noise] and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ... you know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think this package bombs are means of disrupt the news elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these national strike group and bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to hold the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats and the deep state laws as they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way your ear ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy up urban he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here in ... the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise]\nThe FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean I like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy well I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\n[noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being in a lot of trouble\nTheoretically he'll eventually eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why isn't that happening now the Republicans round the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations\nThat Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing at once these elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him they if they really\nSorry we'll let's discuss the you think Trump is essentially on the ballot\nIn in this election there's no wrong answer her don't don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you think that Trump is essentially on the ballot that this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in Toto are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this was going to be their big moment when they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this is the beginning of the end\nFor you know what I Will do something with it I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blonde or has been keeping up with the tech\nAnd to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff\nAnd it's all written by among the young millennial journalists and they have ever since election day two thousand six day and they

ask the question of taste such on his comment yesterday about the care of that\nYeah I I Know how lucky I Am to be born in the U.S [noise] I have compassion for oh people all over the world to live in poverty who live under a horrible condition\nBut it it kind of the world's population live on less than ten dollars per day fifty percent live on less than two dollars\nDo you sense it so my question is are we obligated to let all of them and to the u._s. um art to support them all the U.S tax dollars and\nIt's not how do we choose who to give the upcoming in the U.S and she was a trick question I'd like to suggest that we have an answer for that and it's called the legal immigration which is the only way to make that choice\nHere here exactly right the way we have always done it you know getting into this\nCountry under legal circumstances has always been a privilege it's always been an honor its always required some effort you have to learn about America you you have to want to be an American\nNow as for governor case that I don't think governor Casey was advocating for anybody in poverty around the world being led into America that's not what he was doing\nHe was simply trying to advertise the size of his heart to I think governor case it is still one of these people\nThat thinks Donald Trump has destroyed the Republican Party and the things governor Casey cares about the governor case it once everyone in hey you know I saw a big heart I look at these people that are down trodden a disadvantage that I still love 'em and I still care about it but I don't think all of them and we've got to be able to put ourselves in a\nIn in their shoes and understand it he just want everybody to understand and he has a carrying fought for compassionate person as opposed to this

from CNN\nAnd justice after the CNN sucks sticker on this van [noise] CNN sucks [noise] here we go\nThat image than on top of course the president and direct deaths is not technically of responsible for that but he is responsible for not just allowing the chat than and suck at his rallies but stoking making clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years and looks like\nOne may have emerged and that is the danger and that is the reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you could have political discourse but when you've crossed the line\nIt is extremely dangerous and that has what has been giant on mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs\nAnd you know in a in a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except the theory is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crackpot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely threatening people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and\nAnd there's not there's never any condemnation of the you'd never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump ... this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure the people it's the inter find people that are that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless way as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they attempt to do with you and the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun in a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable include some wouldn't do that to anybody always comes down to Trump how a lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make her\nI'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it they're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act\nAnd then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted\nTo decorate and dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop\nThis is what you would do so my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference\nA young black leaders from all over the country this is not been done before in in this in this manner\nUh [noise] and he's talking

including his own policy\nAnd Obama would never even always position himself as an outsider are up against powerful interests that were standing in his way and he was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I marveled at this and how how the relationship between Obama and the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable and all those lives about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing\nNever called him on it well here's Trump out there and he's acknowledging law enforcement and they're going to call him a total fraud here\nBy trying to say he's for unity when he's that guy and they're going to say is responsible for it is not a man\nAnd they'll say that he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit in it\nThat he's trying to stand above it they gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to mark my words [noise] okay for those have you're watching on the dental camp here is a shot that has three windows filled with stickers what in their ...\nAnd his

Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically a tie the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter

could help him network with power for developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there is a Politico story today I actually saw it last night\nThat Trump fears a Florida wipe out that Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the the socialist in Florida are going to win everything\nAnd so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political stir and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs drugs has links to them that are the socialists of America appear ready to win and

playing field won't change much although it appears that some of the races in toss up are getting even\nThat says it's getting more difficult to see a path to the majority for Democrats\nWith Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp heading for defeat in North Dakota Democrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority be one way would be the whole the five Democrats seats in toss up and pick

inspiring it motivating revenue him up I mean there's so much that we don't know yet and we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is\nDespite all of that there is enough information gleaned simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today and you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democrat Party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years on this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big\nThat is so outrageous what has been\nDone in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies and the Trump campaign lying to the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees staffers\nAnd so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia that Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with smaller\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor\nOn the Trump campaign you never met Trump he never gave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was how many drop your advisory shoes obviously\nIs that these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign the guy's name Stephan helper\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph Smith Seward who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London and the ambassador\nIs stepping options you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head\nHe didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true so Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigations go get the ... orange what's all bogus\nThat was not when the investigation started it started\nWay before that my point is how much the deep state wants their government back\nWe don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother and but this whole two years silent who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever find out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had to win and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion without well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it is true I'm not\nI have no doubts about it I build those people are capable of anything to get what they want I have no doubt about it\nAnd I'm Sorry it's not my fault for being suspicious they have made me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy\nDonald Trump to overturn the election results to thousands sixteen and it was codified epitomize if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop and they I I don't need to be told her reminding how fit to be tied in range they are over their failure to get rid of Trump\nI Know they're psychology I Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just folks beside themselves that\nEvery thing's they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience\nI don't believe I'm not gonna believe just because I'm told that something
