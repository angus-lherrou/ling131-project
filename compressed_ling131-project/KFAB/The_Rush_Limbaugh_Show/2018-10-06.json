just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal the NIH and find that one of them was Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came somebody raised the question of how when the world that Christine ... letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it was we are made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer 'cause it's so unfair ... spotlight\nAnd\nIt became obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of the letter one would be Senator Feinstein and or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for point of order\nThe chairman Grassley and and ... a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff have lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just ask my staff I just asked my staff if any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her and she starts now that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking\nThem did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you look at the you'd look at ... she turns back to the camera women will make it\nThis is a German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on

ask to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no collaboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein guess will turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your late this letter and they\nOwn nor nor was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it Mr German as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it\nIt was strategic just like what happened on friday was to teach it strategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that have occurred last week among and between Democrat

I've got it\nI'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democratic front groups and organizations are here and the strategies that they use and it\nMakes it crystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake that he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator\nIncident where it just happened\nThat to nearly insane anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activist ended up there in flakes elevator with us CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting and they started accusing and they started pointing fingers he got scared to

crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump wasn't necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\n\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left the Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it and everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen

say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than moving to the right to oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nThat after he makes an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them see he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have

the male version of me too\nWell rush or a million women or nor do they actually do well\nYeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not\nAbout even Bannon set it this is not just

out of balance all Trump did was say why every body following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\nThat's what the Democratic party isn't so and that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove he didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in

for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nIt's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the written baggage is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the this this ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was a and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party

unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\n... ... ... in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent\nBullying intimidating movement that has

capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for
