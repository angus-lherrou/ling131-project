up first today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir hey\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to armed with school police and it was voted down eight to one\nWell the thing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have the Mayor Bill Clinton was very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with the gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells your but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about something much\nLarger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have\nIt's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech\nExcept\nYou can't say this you can't say that you can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in these circumstances but but but but but well we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned\nThis let's go to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit seem\nSo a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill and the first question\nA drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that tells you this guy's got\nEven loaded with guns why here's a drive by it's not\nReally focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation\nThere's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway the reporters just Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws this has\nTo do with it if you if you if they had protection inside as a result would have been\nSome kind of a protection inside the deaf\nOr maybe you could have been a very much different situation\nHe was able to do things that unfortunately shouldn't have been able to do\nAnd next up F Chuck Todd of meet the press who thought that the Russians were behind the pipe bomb or\nA Cesar ... shut the Russians might be behind that\nThis guy that that that also gets more curious as time unfolds [noise] this guy was was uh [noise] do you ever have you\nEver heard of a routine failure you ever known anybody that was always on the verge of a big score hitting it being\nAnd never amounted to edit that apparently was this guy [noise] seeing as her ... anyway we'll get back there but the minute here's the mayor of Pittsburgh with F. Chuck Todd on meet the press on his name is William ... due to an F Chuck said is there\nAnything the president personally can do if there's something you'd like to see him do personally about\nSee see how this works [noise] see him somebody clearly\nMentally unstable who has been a nut case for a number of years who hates Trump by the way because he thinks Trump is a fellow out\nTo the Jewish people and here's object\nTo asking the mayor of Pittsburgh is Trump responsible if Trump culpable if there's something you'd like to see the Trump do personally about gun violence\nI brew long to an organizational bipartisan organization called ... again still legal guns I don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues mosques and churches\nWhat they say when you ask them that\nYou know [laughter] I don't what what do you think they're going to say rush what do you what do you think they're going to say that they didn't say damn well that's\nRight and they're never going to they're never going to they're not that Obama was there a guy Obama was who they think they are\nRight you know challenge a well spoken highly educated reasonable ACA damning

because of the ancient history of America with slavery discrimination and all that could have said that that really we we we can't\nHold them accountable way they have excuses you know we gotta look the other way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd that was Farrakhan standing right next

an\nEntirely different fits why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump
