in the country specifically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against a to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we\nKnow it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country surviving as founded we're under assault it has never been worse or they made of the civil war but but those were different circumstances a that was a specific argument\nAbout cultural things regarding slavery that any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered\nMulti faceted all out assault on the entire concept\nOf America as mound some people's sense it some people are not aware of it\nAnd I I've I've uh just sort of evolved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bells and it may be present some\nSolutions but after I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are so that's coming up as the program an falls back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president\nFirst off apologizing to the nation\nApologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him and they have an episode codified is exactly what I think we're up against\nAnd it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas the left is not\nInterested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limits on how low they will go on how get braved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality in all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean getting back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention or whether it's because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born or and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't do it\nSo the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this and I\nThought [noise] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy discussion or acknowledgment\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles and our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence Kavanaugh was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says buddies believable staying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for ... months coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history on it the child like wailing and immature the is the result of the liberal socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nVideo and video of these kids on Saturday afternoon literally calling the doors of the Supreme Court they get in to try to stop a real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and miss this was just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders all of it promoted not denounced all of it promoted\nAnd encouraged by the powers that be and the media and the Democratic party and the ... of the left as I've been saying what a decent people do in response to the different people or we're we're not going to become them\nThey may have as an objective a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but we're not going to be come who they are we don't have it again is to become who they are so given that\nHow are they stopped it's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political murder\nTo stop\nThings they don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you oppose them how to beat that back to do it with the city to do it with politeness do you do it with manners I'm Sorry and going to cut it\nThat capital has no business being a judge anywhere much less the Supreme Court that cabin on needs to be destroyed justifiably so that's what people were supposed to ... and that's what mid term voters were supposed to agree to punish anybody who would try to force\nUs this week about miscreants like capital on the country but it didn't work out that way\nMore on this of course but let's go to the phones will start the nation's capital Washington DC this is Sandy I'm Glad you called Hi\nI Am so pleased topped the rash thanks for taking my call [noise] I watch uh the president Nikki Haley this morning I think Nikki Haley could tell the president a few\nThe CEO of her plants I think today was deliver it on the hill says Cavanaugh I think he's got somebody in mind is going to announce that person before the election and what are the drive by the Democrats going to do\nThey're going to start fighting oh we can have this person well this is terrible and [noise] then what's going to let the election people are going to say it's not going to stop we can't allow the Democrats back in\nIt isn't going to stop whether the Democrats win or lose this is the point you're right but if you ever going to stop until these people are so soundly defeated and become such a a very small group of people even then they're not going to stop\nIt Kevin or things not the end of anything that Kavanaugh saying for for as far as most people are concerned the\nWay you need to look this is the beginning this is the beginning of the white it's gonna be for as long as we allow it to be done to us\nAt ...\nAnd and you're right they're going to try to poke holes and whoever Trump's nominee for UN ambassador is I haven't heard any names I haven't paid close enough attention and those are the names being bandied about might be\nBut they're going to do it on principle they're gonna do it because they think it'll be a political advantage headed in the mid term showing once again the the world the country doesn't think Trump is justified and qualified to be naming anybody that his position he doesn't he doesn't deserve to be president we need to get rid of it and it's an old\nFoundation for which they are going to be have a anyway the question is does this

and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried this\nTrump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on an interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies\nYou can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing because\nThere's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton according to draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously\nI guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy and and we and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and\nThat'd be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got\nTo try if they've got to be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much

true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nWritten seats familiar leading Democrat I mean this is the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this\nIs a white by

telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other\nThat two hundred nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan ... sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine feet firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this guy with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump has a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election\nNight two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than the alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started we said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what\nWas I watching the other you know this this last week was premier awake for all of the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're S. U. V. or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order\nAnd you know officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or I don't I\nAm having them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this uh well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn and people with Avon so load block cab idiots\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who any other normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a queen size zero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancelled law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that had been out\nThere long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\n\nSo you really you think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House states can be up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating family [noise] [noise]\n\nWell [noise]\nUh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night services it's really a lot of Republican retirements what yeah committee chairman are retiring cause their term limited\n\nForty three members are retiring some are committee chairmen and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you gotta ...
