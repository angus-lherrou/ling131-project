are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers Democrats and Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty

a feminist journal in academia accepted an anti male rewrite of mine comp these hoax stirs reroute a three thousand word essay\nOf mind comp\nAnd tool that as anti male pro women feminism and this
