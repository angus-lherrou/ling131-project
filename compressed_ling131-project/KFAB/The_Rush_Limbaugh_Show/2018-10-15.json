of the media is now flooding the zone with polling data showing that it's hopeless for Republicans just folks steel yourself for this this is predictable it was going to happen and they're also going to say that it's all based around Trump it's all based on Trump hatred it's all based on people rip\nRegretting their vote for Trump a reading\nThe direction America is going in all of that I just saw it happen on CNN a independent\nVoter is switching math in ways that Democrats in the run up to the mid term elections\nAnd if I were you I've I hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of this I you know in and out of tune in a way\nI Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of the early voting that that is of\nThat that's happening out there so it's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth that the left bands together you don't ... I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election and our allies and that's why it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one who wouldn't be running\nVarious cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the election\nIs uh the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have an everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of\nPolling data and says the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awaken realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in the history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get bombed\nFor the tactics they have engaged in from the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and then a sane society they wouldn't be punished greatly in the midterms\nI still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide provided that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nThat I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union the lion was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is high and yet they it's not hostile sounds hot sauce on the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily within within the stupid country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO\nTo protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade and not going to do it any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so high cost of the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds to me it sounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational\nAnd of course in the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be wife during\nThe socialists they think still\nFunctioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises which\nSay what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politician\nSo not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on them you know they'd be says he's going to do something he's going to do it or die trying we don't have the wall yet but not for lack of trying\nAnd we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of trying now the Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read birth issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of a sudden\nTrump wants to once again take away health insurance from people with pre existing conditions where did this come from\nOut of thin air it came out of thin air there's no way Trump wants to do this there's no Republican that wants to this is the reason the Republicans didn't go for a full repeal of Obamacare as pre existing conditions\nWhich it get down to brass tacks preexisting conditions being coverage is not even insurance there's no way you can get insurance if your house catches fire and then go buy insurance nobody's going to sell you insurance was the houses on fire or after it's been robbed\nSo we're not even talking about insurance but we are\nAs far as the general public is concerned so I don't know where all of a sudden Donald Trump and every Republican candidate for the house in the Senate wants to take away\nHealth insurance or preexisting conditions when did this happen no Republicans out there saying that\nIt's sort of like when Joe ... a ... a George Stephanopoulos was interviewing um ah well questioning Mitt Romney in a debate\nAnd he asked and you think the states should be able to ban contraception Romney look the rest of what\nNobody is talking about that stuff and I I don't care for that he's talking about I Wonder when you think should states have a right to ban contraception Ravi looks around I guess what we're not talking about George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wouldn't even think of this I don't know why are you asking me I just want an answer quit stalling\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it\nFor doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows he in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got at the roster coming up probably do where he said something to her that is as as honest in true as anything he's ever said\nBecause I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various ...\nRats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell us about my opinion is that the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said and I I think that's probably\nTrue as a New Yorker and emerged in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York state I made fun of him and they laughed but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about Trump there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but\nIt all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kinda like McCain was\n\nSo when you send to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised\nThis honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but thought he knew before he ran for office and I think\nA lot about the left a lot about\nDemocrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment he fully\nRush Limbaugh please I'm lucky I fees network news radio eleven\nThey

owl earth first\nA natural forest station\nControversy that was all part of a global warming craze in the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... at our founding\n\nThe left where fatty they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we shot down trees and we haven't replaced them to make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I pointed\nOut you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is the word the industry they need what right I didn't get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource\nAnd for every tree that's cut down for a new ones are planted it's part of the policy a warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that they couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two then there was in the Seventeen hundreds\nGetting access to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever and and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want to cut down the redwoods never come back you know I'm the same token\n\nOff the American myself when I\n\nHaving owners pride take care of your car is about more than just

plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop\nOf blood was black you're black or this was this is a grotesque cruel her ... percent interest so small\nThey don't have to excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection allergy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties use can Nazi Germany it against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans not meant for conservatives is not even about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activist\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that let\nGlad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so you're more than welcome to find a good host I remember that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either Bush law or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how oppressed and how much of a pressure you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection out of me for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out I mean it's basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that uh\nUh cohabitation with that with militant Islam is that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people\nIntersect is why they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those\nAnd they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ship has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression to speak their language\nSo she is saying that she is an old cat she's arrested him anyway she is a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm white\nHowever what I discovered was zero point eight percent subs\nHer in Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professor shifting African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American just\nPray just admitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor for the Afrikaners are not black uh I well I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to black skin okay All right\nI just wanted to ... because a sub Saharan this is somebody what are you in sub Saharan what is it what it was it and then you start talking the sub continent than some people really get confused you're jumping from I'm from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Saharan desert or which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of this arid desert as well now I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow\nA away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the because the elections I I think a lot of his is rooted in they have Trump either as many of them do\nAnd they live and breathe\nTo expose Trump for whatever they think he has to the point that people have Anthony I'm Glad you waited\nA Scott very much thanks so much John in Tacoma, Washington your next I'm Glad you

over to the theater I I I watched it over there but um [noise] I wanted to I I I just wanted to portray how\nAnd it was is they were very very powerful movie and to illustrate that I just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie\nI'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then the the credit start rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff\nBut this did not happen at the end of the movie guys now after that after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credits finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nThey're smoking I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I'm I'm I made a calculation when I was talking about those on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it\nTexas too but my my my big ... in Oklahoma and I am a I have a she sat folk on and says her great great grandmother the Cherokee well so is mine we have\nUm you know family
