back you go\nI I've been way back before that even so uh but\nHey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one\nThing that the Democrats won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income trumpets caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that fit this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought that it\nThat the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon Trump do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNo I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing\nA ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's just I all I can say these are smarter than I Am\nA navy but but I mean\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding the zone\nWith four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump pass a bill but Waldor Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lot of chicken saying range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he has promised and that's the that's the uh well actually exactly right\nAnd right there that's the store\nAnd the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even start so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution than these things to keep the\nOil hey I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nLeaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nNot just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall\nBecause of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[laughter] they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he's a uh that have come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut many of the ... the ...\nI think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was going to be a garner a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive and it\nIt that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because of the ... the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected and it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm payroll left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince either floated may call\nAnd they have\nTo know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message ... talk so we

Iraq Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen\nAnd the election of ... thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrats ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone Raj Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates him [noise]\nBut anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage in anger there promoting insanity and the lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump\nSentiment in a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not when the Democrats say\nThe justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nThey're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out remember Obama's\nThey say the economy was his well that would over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned Matt and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dead continued to try and portray America as this unfair on just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative\nSo I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon Bream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no polling shows that the Republicans are going to hold on to the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve Hilton who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason\nWhy what was Limbaugh getting this I mean it's not a single pulled out of the shows this happened precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by their gospel and I really think um\nIf I Lived in Washington each and every I don't I couldn't I wouldn't it be\nOstracized after not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nSo he'll just yeah I tend to agree with him a I think there's a lot of people don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even answer when the pollsters call I think there's a lot of people not being contacted up next Kaylee Mac a nanny\nWho is the spokeswoman for the Republican National committee\nHave bought on that with Russ Limbaugh about this so called hidden Trump voter I talked to a pollster who said to me that in the aftermath of the election he went out in Michigan and in California\nAnd thirty seven percent of Trump voters than they refused to tell a pollster when they were called ... supported President Trump thirty seven percent had nearly a third of the Trump voter\nRight [noise] uh\nSo then we have Fox is able to find a couple of people who um [noise] I agree a ... minute it'll come and Shannon Bradley ... I'm a strategy behind this I'm just I'm just answering the question what I think I've got no strategy I'm not trying to make people changed the way they're voting I I mean that that's not\nThe purpose

just great which he probably wanted that shows that you ever hacked\nReally simple and you basically had to call and people just called in with their start a business is you know small talk about\nHow they're doing you know where they are\nSo yeah yeah you don't you don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy they were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar people and not blue collar people\nAnd so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it right and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and\nThey were they were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumpster angry or any of that\nRight now and it was it was just it was just I mean it was like my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because it was working in January one or ... or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day but ah right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know let me just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrats that stuff I mean which is people the people won't buy 'em\nWell don't don't were downplayed a Republican or Democrat bad thing that goes there still are a whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something ... do you think that people need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before\nLeave it\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or to doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I ... I work a lot of hours and I'm I'm I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work you know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone well\nOkay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts\nWould maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone and not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... mosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi how're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you [laughter]\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell ... yeah but if there's not a Britain it's been all aimed at stopping anybody from crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that's going to happen these done too much into little time\nOh I don't either get either leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this\nCaravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals that we had and then there's not and\nWe have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it\n\nYet not serious money and certainly not serious construction there for his theory was that the Democrats\nAre trying to demonstrate that is never going to happen and Trump doesn't even care than it ain't\nGoing to happen\nAnd what better way to illustrate isn't four thousand people storming the border and not being stopped\nAh let's see grabs a sound bite number four team Nikki Haley she went to the Al Smith dinner in New York last night we own normally only hear about what happens with the Al Smith dinner\nDuring the presidential elections it's a it's a big dinner at the Waldorf hysteria and it's a Catholic charity organization\nAnd it is required that presidential candidate show up at this thing\nAnd it's always two to three weeks before the election\nAnd they do they they show up and it's a night of comedy Ninety five percent and the other the other five percent of the speeches um get serious and political and they all show up and it's incredible to that the Al Smith dinner\nOr at least the ones I've watched who ever writes the jokes\nFor these candidates for this dinner is that they got to be among the best every candidate there have been some exception exceptions but seems like every candidate just has some of the best funniest material\nAnd I you know I Wonder where they find it and it's obviously they're hiring joke writers but from where we don't know well Nikki Haley showed up at the Al Smith dinner last night I mean she didn't storm in there she was invited obviously but this is causing\nPeople to believe that Nikki Haley has got some residential perspiration\nGoing on and in fact she might Nikki Haley said something less that we don't have this on tape or an audio but she chastised Trump last night she said", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "19"}
