cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average\nAll of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site\nReal clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building and we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here and Tom ... all the polling data that they have real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave\nIf a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how we described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five or they have sort of two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this sense the signs and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend and he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\n\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these

locations stadium tour they're going to charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clinton sucked anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest\nThat happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in the Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump and his phone in collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now at Obama certainly isn't\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hate and so much anger their wife or their mirror here's not sick it just it just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what in form\n... and a educated suspicions about this would tell you that it is [noise] uh we'll see we'll let\nTime on the phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello hey\nRussia or if you if there was a kid or riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate that you very much\nRussia you know it's a you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous stories right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYeah that that information just not out there for the masses of pain you know there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they want to do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and like video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's well it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flipped that\nFlip that around what it make a lot of ...\nIt's for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not\nGoing the way they have assured us for the last nine months it was going to go more poor going it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this\nThis mob of people flooding the border vi intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the tweets here is really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nNegatives Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and the Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state\nAnd this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts so started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and we'll watch your were born to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nThere it was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner empathy and said\nIt was Hillary plans to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing\nThat right correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons at great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no\nAh you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off and so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist here but take a look at\nIt it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them this is a this was a philosophy that I have stalled for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say these are all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth um if\nIt is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody then he can still move the needle\nIn working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts I used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton I'm a week before\nAnd it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us and she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but\nI I have\nFor everything you've done to my family I Can't help but I find you the most compelling most interesting guy\nThat I
