balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for it it's all focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious is there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with\nSeven

left is just that this up and when you look at that and examine that from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it isn't it's not a caravan that's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nDemocrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election that the way\nThe Democrats have been motivated like you can't bully to get out there and make

fear ahead of election\nI don't care what Donald Trump lives about ... states are there is no body in Morocco bombers\nLeague in terms of purposely lying\nTo deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan\nWith Obamacare your average and you won't premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dupe\nUnwinding Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a centrally be cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they like their doctor in play and there wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out of course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American\nPresident would lie about such things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turns out those wise again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives\nIf you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the media run banner headlines Obama's spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare\n[laughter] no way how about the Benghazi disaster with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\n\nThose are all lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protect\nHimself\nAnd Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision about the law is Obama told about drawing a red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousand tenet germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody well\nWhen you think about it was great to government do remember who started or remember\nWho was and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody liking God like you got to look up seeing him but you're you're so far but neither me can't see you just look it up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where his greatest coming to strike for rock Obama\nCourt and create these economic circumstances if his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and\nHe doesn't know how because he doesn't believe in what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia\nOn getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even\nGet rid of more nukes in our stockpiled then I could be for\nThe guy was just an auditor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president then the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when it came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand San\nPut a picture up we got a picture for you to get a camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have to picture side by side and make the switch on the left is Obama in Nevada on the right is Trump last night in Houston\nTake a look you can't even see Trump in that picture on the right the media is a large contingent of the people on the floor of their maybe from that angle it's about it's about one third of it you're going to put it under five hundred people in there if you're going to kick the

on here\nThis is all politics\nPure and simple total politics disguised as something else the Democrat Party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities and is in the process of trying to normalize them all by in training them as policy planks or issues in the Democratic party platform\nAnd this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nBeing given the whole weight of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority and ended up being bullied into submission\n\nI have long believed that\nI just didn't have a ... not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it\nBut I finally did\nAnd I really do believe that\nThere are many psychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party as political issues that are then used as a as as\nThe joined the list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledge that government or deal with or the government funded a that government protect and this of course then turns the Democratic party coalition in to an even larger group of minorities\nBut it it conveys political issue status\nTo things that\nProbably have no business being involved in politics it's a way to further and this is the fundamental voice by embracing all these various problems\nAnd and making them political issues it's another classic way\nOf bullying\nThings on a majority that you're trying to overthrow or unseat\nAnd you do it by characterizing them as insincere

to these people they're converting these mental disorders which needs to be treated\nBy professionals are converting them into political issues they're whipping up a bunch of anger\nAnd they're
