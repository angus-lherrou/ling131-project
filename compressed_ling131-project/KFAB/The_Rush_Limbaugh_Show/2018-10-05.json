that meant a\nThere would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transforming America man so why did he claimed that man was taking on issues like

some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist fact look and there's a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news

you see [noise]\nEven though it may be anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would they held can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism in communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo socialist in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennials men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its target to the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want there pal around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons it tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant\nAnd it just the nature of things and so they're being\nHighly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government\nIs the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative\nRepublic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of

of appeal do except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy\nDoes when he's in trouble another poll quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary if combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they

my Thomas Jefferson the public life is about life liberty pursuit of happiness the fulfillment of the white American man's\nDesires\nAssumed the force of the\nMeeting an automatic\nAnd became the ultimate purpose of this country society if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis bingo these people prove me ride each and every time I go analyzing them\nSo the trouble with America is it it was a stab Bush by white men for white man and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd life and liberty was only intended for white man and if any white man was instructed in the pursuit then there was something wrong with America do not minimize this I'm telling you this belief is animating the last two generations informing the last two generations\nOf kids going to high school and college this is the kind of dribble but they are being taught that America is corrupt from its founding days that it was founded for an exclusive group of people white man nobody else need apply\nMy question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that has come out yet\nI I'm Wondering is not is it is the Democrats oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nIt's going to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote changes it was certainly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nAnd it's not about to come out that's the whole point you know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley referenced it and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls e foreign witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's

and it ABC CBS NBC began to report on this day but wouldn't change one Democrat Senate vote\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell a turtle\nWell the question is why when Republicans make make a greater effort to come out\nWhy ever to ah\nAh [noise]\nIt's in the FBI report and Republicans and Democrats can see it if the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered it let's\nCombine knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned but we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not

know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nSome reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce it\nAnd Grassley saying you must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post a Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd

other they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules and and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphones and been to the Senate or are they\nThe media people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member theater coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule by voting to\nConfirm judge Kevin on the floor\nThat was during his a southern for remarks today in favor of capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out\nThe Democrats like this fit to be tied now I think I have some might relate to it I got an email\nLast night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaigns season of two thousand sixteen she went through all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo uh never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a known for her last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump to gather now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did so for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in\nIn in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way\nSadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the capital circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nJust continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there\nDon't know why I Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst\nBecause of how Trump voters that per se and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he is being treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of rage has somewhat diminished until Kavanaugh came along and re awaken these people and fired them back up\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh\nHas served as a reminder Anna\nHighlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from cabin all by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy as high [noise] now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen two thousand Eighteen midterms now where I Will she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people voted for Trump are deeply involved with things\n\nAs I saw it looks like\n\nThere's look back at\nAnd now the hard way to go we can sports time capsule\nFor fans of Sandy West and I'm here to take you back on a journey to this week in sports history\nWith our way back in Nineteen oh three were the first World Series begins play\nBoston Americans need the Pittsburgh Pirates\nFive games to three and a best to nine zero five\nOh this week in Nineteen thirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call three points the centerfield before ... into the Wrigley Field bleachers in the fifth inning game three of the world series and the Yankees won seven to five week in Nineteen fifty one third baseman Bobby\nThompson hits a one out three run home run on the bottom of the ninth inning to win the national tennis for the New York giants Thompson's homerun wrapped up in amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series of the Yankees\nThe top is miraculous home run remains one of the most memorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world\nThis week in Nineteen eighty Larry Holmes retained his WB the heavyweight title defeating Mohammed Ali and if we can two thousand one in the Atlanta Braves defeat the Florida Marlins twenty three to clinch the national league east title and become the first team in professional sports ten consecutive division\nTitles that your heart radio weekends for a time capsule\nHamilton hasn't gotten from a retinue and you know I'm I'm\nHamilton the cubs adoption stories started at a shelter visit the shelter pet project done or to find a pen near you brought to you by Matisse onto the humane society of the United states and the capital\nWhat else can your smart speaker print about news weather and try to make sure you please and thank you place a B on I saw the continued [noise]\nOkay to review and heard a letter to Feinstein balls the Ford refers to her best friend labeling Kaiser is a he falls the Fords best\nFriend is a woman mostly Ford will notice so if we\nWin Kaiser's referred to as he he and the letter it's logical to conclude in Boise for getting write the letter\nOkay well then who might have helped her well that would be Monica McQueen at who's home ... was in robots Delaware at the time the letter was written McLean former FBI spokesperson also worked for ...\nThe reason I'm going through all this is the balls the Ford is is using people that are tied and link ... hip and the heart and the brain to Democratic Party activism\nFrom the FBI to the department of justice to the Senate Judiciary committee\n\nNow Monica McLean lawyer happens to be a guy named David Wasserman according to the Washington Post David off men helped oversee\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server problem which she was exonerated\n... also helped oversee about Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in two thousand sixty\nSo how is it the balls the Ford ends up in the home of a woman who's\nTied to the D. J. and the FBI\nAnd characters who weren't involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation how does that happen\nIf you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Paolo Alto and you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be on the Supreme Court\nAnd you don't think you should be because you think one time he\nAttacked you you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein to the next thing you know\nWell no no no that's used and find signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain\nWho probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he is\nNot a woman which she is so you're just you're a beach Bab psychology professor whatever from California and you end up\nWriting a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying and\nTheir lawyers don't tells you that the committee is willing to fly out to California to interview you\nI I I was I didn't know I I didn't know you I I Will you I Would ... view in my home if you had ... I don't even think I buy this\nThey she didn't want them to come out there because she was going to go to Delaware to meet with McLean\nShe doesn't want the committee seeing who she was meeting with\n\nThis whole thing required her to come to Washington for this to pull off she had to come to Washington\nSo we look at Hillary Clinton's email server investigation and the Trump Russia collusion what are we find a woman who happens to\nBe helping balls the Ford just feet Brett Kavanaugh and his\nNomination to the Supreme Court\nWith every Democrats saying within minutes of Kevin all being nominated they're going to oppose it\nWhat every Democrats that they believe her even though she doesn't have any evidence of time magazine just\nPut her on the cover to cover at time magazine was was over the gift occasion above\nBoard a lasting she's she's she's seen taking meals a it's pathetic\nThis whole thing is going to set up is my point and the people that set it up are the same people that have been running was fine with coups against Donald Trump\nAnd every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee knows everything I just told you but rather than it would be a problem they're telling themselves how well organized they are and how brilliantly they pulled\nIt's off in their world they've made the American people really believe that this woman was minding your own business one day when she was Fifteen and this nominee to the court came in brutalized her\nAnd she's just a woman that she\nLikes to children in a sterile\n... cheese here [laughter]\n\nThat's what a masterful Dwyane Wade pulled off we got everybody in this country thinking hey but summing it didn't happen did that we have nothing to do with it when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay\nAnd that's why ... won't turn over any of the cycle or the therapy Emily a polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at\nAnd the Republicans notice too but the power of the Democrats look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and can confirm Kavanaugh\n\nThis democratic machine is a scary scary bunch Democrat machine includes the media\nAnd all of these\nPsychological deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committed violence\n\nWe got one of them who has just been arrested\nFor docs thing a bunch of Republican senators\nThat is a that's tech lingo for releasing their documents boxing means to discover all of their private information name address phone number bank accounts all that stuff and making it public and a guy who interned for for for Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd I think worked for Feinstein is the guy that did it\nAnd don't forget Feinstein had a had a Chinese spy on her staff for a year driving her around I mean it might be legitimate to ask why does the Chinese spy actually a spy\n\nMe put it in a different did Feinstein that he was a spy and and that's why he was there\nI don't know I'm just tells you we we haven't been again subjected to a gigantic\nReal life Netflix drama this thing has been scripted and has been choreographed it hasn't been rehearsed\nIt had\nAn objective ... failed and this is the reason we're learning all this the objective was for Kavanaugh to withdraw\nThey thought that they would get Kavanaugh so intimidated and making him think that all of this was so futile that in order to spare himself this assault he would withdraw his nomination ... during that Trump would withdraw\nSo asked disparate him the embarrassment they miscalculated both ways\n\nSo now we've had a procedural vote we're gonna have a real Senate confirmation vote tomorrow on a totally manufactured written and I'm sure it's been tested\nScript\nWith the power

photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski\nI don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked Feinstein's wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental camp there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally wasn't Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein's looks like\nShe is\nWell the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand up she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the dental camp do you see\nThe pain expression on the face of Murkowski and the ... of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of diet for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but what are you watching on the digital camera to be able to see these that's\nThat close up is the same shot just to close up of the previous slave televised photo\nIs that right well done here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nI mean it's it's been really pained look on her face and it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for [noise]\n[noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call at romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes informed so

breaking story but in the Senate campaign in Tennessee\nThis is kind\nOf interesting this is the marsh show Washburn story or race uh let's see [noise] Marsha\nBlackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is filled bridges\nAnd\nBreathe is and is saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh is a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat doing saying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh this was in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red and over he just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction\nAnd reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is my coworkers seats And Corker by the white has also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose the actions are men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody we're going to design a seat on the\nCourt because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperate temperament and they weren't going to deny because he committed perjury and I've been going to deny it because if your eyes in a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKevin ... should be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action argue but what what am I where am I going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they have it\nEngaged in it\nOh we've got to make up for lost time the left so Phil breed is and\nWho is starting to lose grounds fall behind black burn in the race to replace Corker\nI mean this is really strange time to go public against\nHis own party he's a former governor of Tennessee\nAnd he\nIssued a statement rebuilding Democrats for hijacking the confirmation process as a license to indulge in partisanship\nIf he was on the Senate floor right now breeders and announcing Kevin ... it'd be planning your swearing in ceremony\nRead this and said he was disgusted by the treatment Dr Ford God these determined to help bring about fairer and more respectful treatment of these issues\nThat said he wants to both sides of this so he goes out of your rips into the treatment of Dr Ford but also says Kevin all will be confirmed this this\nIs I wouldn't call it blockbuster but\nIt's one of these things that you look at you wonder why now this one on the on the verge of the boat a democratic candidate for the Corker seat beginnings will lose ... it just tells you\nWhere at least in Tennessee where public opinion on this reside\nReduce the number one of your personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh on the\nWe're talking about legacy box on newsmakers today I'm leery Morgan with me is Adam baseball or the founder of legacy box So Adam right away tell her audience what legacy bucks does NYU started the company in the first place\nYeah we started legacy box really just to help people convert their old home movies in pictures and get them into digital files that they could save forever

to the phones now this is Patrick in Philadelphia great to have your sir hello\nThank you rush so much super huge make a big big does my friend thank you sir\nA long time listener or probably Nineteen Ninety three was when I started listening daily and uh it was actually lucky enough to see you in Philadelphia at the Kimble center when you auctioned off your Harry Reid letter\nAll that was awesome that was that was on the that was on the campus of the University of what a great hole that was that was one of the nicest venues I've ever had a public appearance and\n[noise] and it was one of our fun it's nice to have my brother Joe got the tickets I was lucky enough to tag along with a few other family members and there's quite memorable you're told the best Hillary Clinton joke I've ever\nHeard my life [laughter] is that the elevator joke yeah yeah yeah yeah [laughter]\nRight [laughter]\nAnd now you got me in a central everybody wants to hear the joke oh since you were brought to think about it go ahead I don't want it to encroach on your time what was it that you call it about\nI get you know the left as fully aware rushed that there's things behind the scenes that the public will never know but that's their we call it the deep state but that's their standard operating procedure\nFigured you were talking earlier about uh you know things we wouldn't know that the American citizens wouldn't know behind the scenes that had the Democrats stone faced yesterday and and why they noted Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed up there you know our only hope that my family's only hope is that their hatred of cabin all means he really is that good\nOh he is in that sense of it there's there's a rap on Kavanaugh to you know what the rap on Capitol is that he's a he's a Bush establishment guy I mean he is\nThe staff secretary for George W. Bush in the first time that the rap on him is that he is is is a not a deep state or but that he is a swamp dweller\nA and there are some people who think that there could have been a more conservative choice Amy Coney Barrett but he was like look at it and he he is good don't don't believe any of that this guy threatens the Democrats as much as if Antonin Scalia or back alive and were up for re confirmation\nGood you know as much as they try and thrown at this guy I really think that there are only purpose behind the continued FBI investigation was to try to make like ... you know dig for everything until you find something\nOh there's no question delayed delayed delay and get lucky and find something that you can meet people believe or something really existed but\nNo you're absolutely right about everything there so far\n[laughter] well they take advantage of the fact like people like me even though I've been listening since Ninety three and I work every day every got got seven kids ... what we do every day we don't have time to to ... a little more so\nSo what happens unfortunately for the rest of the country that doesn't listen to Rush Limbaugh there's not that many but the ones that don't they get these hit bits on the evening news from the drive by media they have no clue what what ... what the real news of the day or the news of the", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "05"}
