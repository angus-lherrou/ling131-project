yesterday police say a sixteen\nYear old stabbed Fifteen year old Lacey paid your own two thirty near the ROTC room senior Chris Hines says he's concerned that some students didn't take the lockdown situation seriously\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all want to\nIt'd be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable\nWay and\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats realized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections\nWith the Native American population because they were losing\nWomen and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here it's a Christian I'm for up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWas done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly crusty on on on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most thoroughly example of\nThis but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened to the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy the ass not by you in fact\nTo Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability crusty on on on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened\nIn the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton that that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urged Democrats to be even more uncivil\nWhat an irresponsible statement every Democrat shoved announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage route ...\nThey supported that is who they are this is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability\nFor I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of

that poll and the results came back then it was quite harmful as Democrats they wouldn't run the results\nThey would get hold of Democrat leaders the media was look this is not working you guys you better get hold of your people to dial back the problem is Democrats can't die all these people back the Democrats don't control these left wing radicals that's why you don't see any public statements

the website than you watch a Trump rally and you hear Trump said things that you\nHeard or read on the podcast or at my website is that right\nOh yeah I mean I hear him say specific things that I Know he you know he's smart but he doesn't come up with himself but so I mean I can see him listening to your podcast like in the morning when he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know if the president listens to the podcast now he's told me he listens to the program and it gets a chance and he is is that but\nYou know who knows but he's told me he does I I I've I've very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I'm just I Want people to hear it how\nDo you get the podcast

it out\nNo no no I was not able to I mean I'm Sorry I was able to figure it out um I think you had fixed a few bucks which which are good the releases you fix were good\nAnd we're constantly working on bug fixes we uh what the up just a a new wave of much I've set up just the other day the developer yeah and I couldn't get this fixed I'm tired of waiting on it\nYeah it used to be if you were in your car and you're listening to our one and then our one runs out it wouldn't go automatically to our two\nWell that now that interestingly that was not exclusive to\nUs that happened to be the way they ended up being bad and\nAnd we did have to change the way they got to have the download 'til you want to play back in the proper order but that wasn't just\nOur podcast it was any number of people that originally it was an ... problem it was the way I tunes organize them ah we're we're eventually able to overcome that with our with our own ... did you use I tunes ... got a straight for the ap\nYeah I mean in fact I bought my first I thought you know I didn't even know what it was right and I bought it because that's how you're ...\nDoesn't want to people here that I Want to hear how easy it is and the palm cast is how would you describe the broadcast\nTo what is it how would I describe it yeah what is it what are you listening to when you listen to the podcast\nOh well I mean I'm listening for what you say but you know it's not broken out by the commercials and things like that so I'm I'm getting your whole show I can get all the information about what's going on like you say I mean you\nKnow what is it about an hour and a half to listen to the whole show our forty minutes\nYeah I mean it's great because like I listen to it on the way home from war\n'cause earning commercials in a pod cast right it's just me yeah\nIt's just you know and then I can knock out and listen to you know your whole show and an hour and a half\nIsn't that amazing thing isn't that amazing that's bigger than we don't double dip on our sponsors\n[laughter] and it's an ... it's a benefit for people\nThat joining become members are Rush Limbaugh's on time if you want the program is free bow there it is in broadcast warm\nYeah I I it's it's great I'm\nWell I'm happy to hear your taking advantage of the of the of the opportunity we were among the first to make\nTo make content

it and podcasts\nYeah and I'm Glad I'm Glad I I get in some other cats but I don't know a lot about them and I'm Sorry I just listened to yours right\nNow well it's a hot on a pod cast is is the is a transmission of ah of audio on what was an iPod hot and cast is how it got his original name\nNow the hype pot has been incorporated into the iPhone and the eye pad and even now downloadable on a laptop that was the name just held but it was related\nTo being able to download audio content like songs in music on an iPod tense podcast\n[noise] great thanks for explaining that to me Congress as long as I can hear you that you know that's all I Need\nThat's that's awesome I I appreciate it but I just to answer your question are we can't divulge members I wouldn't tell them the\nBuddy you're a member you know you never know who's gonna\nDo what are we can guard that information we promise a everybody that is a member that we're going to protect their identity and their privacy will work very hard at it by the way I mean not just from\nA third party agitator and so forth so that's why I Can't tell you whether or not the president and it wouldn't be just the president you know you can you can maybe have the office of the president's communication shop in a number of them couldn't be subscribers I just can't say\nBut\nBut I Am just I'm just flattered that that uh I I appreciate your comments that let me just leave it at that I appreciate very much thank you so much as we are and I was also we're constantly dealing with bugs a little tweaks to be the entire app\nAnd I'm I'm constantly I've I've got a list of things I Want the developer\nTo add a I I [noise] you wouldn't you wouldn't believe [laughter] you wouldn't believe the excuses\nAnd the reasons that are they okay if you want to do that half a million half a million dollars for an apple and Apple TV and sixteen weeks to do what are you kidding me that's what it will be no it isn't there is no way an app as a half million dollars on Apple TV and sixteen\nWeeks or read it but that's what we deal with so work but my point is we're constantly trying to improve this in terms of of user intuition just having it be as natural an easy to use\nProbably will do that tonight and we're going to go down here as soon as we can we don't want to interfere with anybody want to go as soon as possible\nYou have [noise] you know right nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails on this stuff happened you know you're falling apart Russia just proves want to suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nPlans you may think that and I'm not going to try to just abuse your Web but but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump doesn't seem to have any real interest in seeing doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not\nConvey proper information about him is there's so many smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only argue el rushed but but you are the lead voice of the mainstream media you should have the best Avon podcast\nOr should have the ... and ... [noise] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments at a ... liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound credit came across years ago and maybe even you set it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again\nJust wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward\nA barber is what ... ...\nWere trending one where we're not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle ear barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it well\nIt seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and\nIt seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violence shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact and most of the states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one more thing that\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word I Want not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh issue was a labor laws and a win\nFor what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been a rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in on militant and violet socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mess getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be Mitt worm radio unlimited\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy either data of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our bills\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with a ... year\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

observation will powers at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time\nThese are people that are a beef and happy they are excited to be where they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last\nIt was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that unforgettable picture to me of these kids are flowing at the front door of the Supreme

see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy\nPeople in the Democrats sponsors of an audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outrage and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about a minute worse the Trump rally crowd has find a way and it found a way

calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss up on dictionaries in a wicked PTO and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in dignity and then did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so I'm used to having it thrown right back at him with the same force they dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized and they really can't stand being
