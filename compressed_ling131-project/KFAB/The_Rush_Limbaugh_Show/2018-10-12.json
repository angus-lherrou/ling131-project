Hussein all and Michelle my bell oh\n... is is not a single bit of it as ever been corroborated like balls the Ford story not a single bit of corroborate ... no evidence whatsoever and yet that dot CA was used to get a finds a warrant the spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd that dot CA is what kicked off in a truth ... special counsel investigation to try to find collusion between Trump and Russia to many of his old news but that's what Trump's we're learning to and Trump is exactly right the collusion here between anybody in Russia is the ...\nClinton campaign the DNC and the route is Hillary Clinton DNC to a a\nFusion GPS then under Perkins collie and then just deals with the money still got went through a bunch of different layers before he got it but they essentially commissioned an opposition research hit piece on Trump that they tried to celebrate but it was legitimate entails Trump's more to miss out\nHillary those bananas she can't believe the truth is being told about her she can't believe it they can't let this day and so she has\nTo Trump is the guy that as the Russians had me he did it on national TV Trump is the guy that he would and they have tried to make this case\nIt's the funniest thing in the world Trump was down in Miami up his resort down there to route and this was a period of time where Hillary's emails ever sixty thousand total on her server\nAnd she told that there were legal or illegal server private server private address while she sector state\nIs was discovered new and it was Hillary was told she had to turn some of those over she's well half of these are personal and their nobody's business there about Chelsea's wedding reception and her registry and yoga lessons and all that so I'm not going to let you see those she turned over thirty thousand\nDo investigators leaving thirty thousand still unseen\nShe tried to tell everybody they were deleted this\nCaused a frenzy in the media and elsewhere to try to find them and the media kept making a big deal out of it at a lot of other people were too so Trump decided to have a little fun\nIn the middle of the news cycle where Hillary's missing thirty thousand emails were prominently disgust Trump said hey Russia Russia if you're listening maybe you can find Hillary's missing emails and then you can tell us media they might be very interesting although I doubt\nThat moment\nThat I I'm laughing myself silly when I hear that this is it that is my favorite kind of humor this is just Ramadan right down their faces and making satire out of what they do this this is their dead serious about the Trump is mocking them and laughing out they converted this\nEnds with Donald Trump\nOpenly asking the Russians to hack Hillary's surfer and they tried to say that that was evidence of Trump collusion with Russia and Trump was simply doing what Trump does he was laughing at them\nAt the futility that none of the greatest investigative agencies in America can find Hillary's emails the media could not find Hillary's emails the best investigators but nosy as people and nobody can Trump didn't believe nobody could find them\nTrump believes everybody was shielding them in protecting Hillary\nSo he's had hey Russia maybe you can find them none of our people seem to know where they are maybe you could jewelry is still book by this\nWhether you're balding venting or just want to be proactive Dr Mexico has every hair treatment option for you from the first robotic haired transplant procedure in Nebraska to shampoos conditioners Jay ms goes surgical design MD can offer you every hair treatment option available\nWe'd over a decade of experience in Nebraska experience matters no matter the technology checkout Jay Mexico dot com to see all your hair options today\nShop would have my first check out the twenty Eighteen Mazda the FBI loaded with my father monitoring agents display and loses audio south they just ask Dr on today there's nothing else on a ha this is what ...\n[noise] let's go inside the mind of a ten year old\nI mean I Can't ...

probably has opened in some cities or reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is\n\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and Marcy an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty different articles\nSo the trick is how do you do a movie about this\nHow do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed it how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie at its depicted in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you\nIs a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten may be informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause you're\nNot going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happens to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened\nA mass murderer he was a mass murderer of people in the room that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about what he did\nKermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even and his trial it was said that he was charming people\nNow are old buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach you don't want to make your movie a target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so the way I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as it's because of course the left\nAbortion is not even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movement the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is deemed came as one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a guy's now himself as a as an actor and I\nThink ... commercials name as Earl Billings and for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one\nHeck\nOf a job it's probably the finest role that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess\nA as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to states PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGoing to be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people to put their careers with a line of agreeing to appear and start even Searcy or directing\nThe film [noise] uh [noise] [noise]\nI ... I it it it's it's powerfully done [noise] and it opens tonight and if if you don't know about ... now if you've not heard the name of it doesn't ring a bell you by all means should see this if you do know who guys mail is and if you think you know the story\nYou should see this\nAnd it's also good which as I say it follows a procedural format\nSo you're you're not watching a political documentary here you're watching a movie portrayal of a real life events and it's treated as a real life event as any other would be without a lot of political preaching\n[noise]\nBecause it's felt it's not necessary and it isn't the story itself has\nHeart stopping enough as it is so guys now the trial of America's biggest serial killer opening today they've had they've had a the red carpet premieres

inadvertently shows that dystopia of a post row America\nSo whereas we have a bunch of journalists trying to blame Donald Trump\nFor inspiring Mohammed bin ... murder a soda a Saudi journalist\nNow we have this NBC piece which is basically saying that what this movie is inadvertently showing is what will happen if abortion ever becomes illegal guys like God's noble spring up everywhere that guys

is all supposed to be underwater two years ago it was all so close to the underwater all of Miami a it was based on a two thousand at seven Nobel Prize winning award winner Albert Gore predicted it full of Miami\nAnd they global warming you know the rising sea level twenty feet which would be underwater and I just got to think well you know he's not good at predicting the future maybe you can explain the past or someone please explain how about twenty thousand a year in a way that you know\nThis is really a great point and you're you're you're making a really great point here and and because it you're right on the money out Gore had said\nJust in general that current shorelines and he has he has mentioned Miami in South Florida in Manhattan he has predicted when they are going to succumb to rising sea levels will be underwater and he did say\nAbout Miami\nThat it was only a few short years at Miami certain parts of it would be inundated by rising sea levels and one of the places where he said so they are breaking ground on one of the biggest malls in the country do you have to ask yourself\n\nWho in their right mind would go out and get the financing\nAnd make all\nOf the decisions in higher all the architects everything else has to be done to build a gigantic mall only to realize it's going to be submerged underwater\nIn a few years who would do this\nWhat kind of responsible planning commission would permitted what kinda developer would waste is money the point is nobody really believes that were this mall is being built is going to be inundated by rising sea levels anytime soon\nThere's a there's another analogy that this ... Gulf Stream\nWhich is a manufacturer of one of the largest most popular corporate aircraft in America the gulfstream series there's the G. five fifty ... forty five ... four ... four fifty\nA when they announced they were going to build the G six fifty\nThe G six fifty as a like a foot wide or at a little bit taller\nUm has a massive range stays on the yards interior and they announced this at a\nTime where the media was telling us that we were on the verge of running out of fossil fuel and that the supply of fossil fuels was finite\nAnd we were going to have to do something real fast because we're losing fossil you'd have to start conserving and possum feels it's a good thing anyway because they caused climate change and so forth and I asked myself why would Gulf Stream I happen to know the c._e._o. at the time\nI said why are you guys doing this if you how you're going to power this jet how are you ... if there isn't going to be any kerosene refined which is jet fuel jet a if you're not going to have enough jet fuel for anybody who buys this plane to fly it why are you going to make it\nSo well what you're hearing isn't true\nWe routinely study the fuel markets and ... you're right Mr Limbaugh as you always are there's no way that we would design introduced manufacture a brand new jet if there isn't going to be ample supply is a fuel for it\nAnd he said by the way we are not the only people to make jets there continue to make new ones everybody I Know in a jet business says the gulfstream CEO is designing and building new ones in fact Mr Limbaugh you can look around we'll find some people actually trying to redesign supersonic travel\nIn Concord ride I said well how can any of his be\nIf we're hearing that there's a finite supply of fossil fuel and you're not going to get enough for anybody to be able to fuel one of these planes to flying anywhere he said well just simply isn't true\nSo I once again and realized listen to the people who are making financial investments in their products and in their businesses\nDesigned to grow the business and sell them why would they start making new airplanes if there isn't going to be any fuel\nWhy would they build a brand new big mall if it's going to be underwater in five years\nOld you have to do is look at real life look at people at what they're investing in where they are investing in the end you'll know the future\nYou're least nowhere in the smart money thinks we're headed in the future as much as anybody can do it but I'm just here to tell ya\nThat old Jim here on Jupiter is right there is no way on earth you build the biggest mall in the state of Florida or in many other states in a place that you think's going to be underwater or is it allegory thinks is going to be underwater\nDoes that change when Al Gore said no no no in fact\nIn Hawaii they have these things periodically called king tides and when king tides hit in Honolulu and a woman who you can have streets in Waikiki temporarily flooded when those things happen in the king tides of happens we're young when king tides have and that's when Al Gore goes on TV\nTo see see climate change rising sea levels precursor Honolulu soon to be underwater it's just a king tide happens regularly it goes out it comes and it goes away", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "12"}
