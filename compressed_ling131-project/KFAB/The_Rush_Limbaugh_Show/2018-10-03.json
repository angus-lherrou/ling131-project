a big game [noise]\nLack of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left his infiltrated everything's ... obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has them that's that but they've had them now for a year end note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to maybe wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we've got Trump out there they claim he's mocking wealthy forty wasn't mocking or\nWalk I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is only acceptable I don't know why president that he did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's deserve even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine Blasey Ford there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or otherwise or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all he did Republican senators should have done that last week but they could\nSo Trump's Kevin I'm covered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want he understands that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't\nStep and it it may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times and it's been investigating the trucks for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one\nWord you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia at ten for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to they're the ones that said that they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a ... storage\nTrump was a totally comp was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich and his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did was make up the line ...\nThe search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump that he got rich from his dad\nNow they're saying and all kinds of phony entities were created like shell corporations\nAnd other things for Trump and his siblings not just Trump Trump and his siblings to hide money from the IRS [noise] which of course they say is fraud during all of this time forty years\nYou don't think Trump's tax returns have been poring over with a fine tooth comb by I. R. S. auditors\n\nYou think the New York times is found something the I. R. S. didn't all I mean after they've been looking at Trump's tax returns\nI think no Russia\nMeans ... give a let down which we're not going to see any evidence of because they're not going to write that they were but I'm telling you they were they were so sure that that's how they got to get Trump that's how they're going to make Mueller's investigation pay off get Trump's tax returns if you're just thinking about you remember this\nNow and this big long story and the upcoming Showtime documentary\nNo mention of Russia or Russian finances as part of Trump's wealth when they saw that that habit just devastate him so now they have to go looking for other things in this that that that that will supposing not Trump but I'll tell you this\nAngus King who was a senator from Maine as an independent uh was telling a couple of journalists you know you people if you think that this is gonna hurt Trump you have got\nTo learn something you people on the left as Angus King is an independent he goes with the Democrats you got to learn something every time the New York times or CNN or the Washington Post attacks Donald Trump you just blew Trump's supporters even tighter to him\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wages that can answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause when the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing when he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros and she hears key words and what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborate a charge destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor oh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\n... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cassie no I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing to you protest you know there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\n[noise] so what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage in these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told this story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not at all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happening\nThat somebody has to have a lot to say at\nRush probably ... being met for who's\nRadio and living on\nIf he beat ...

right along and without a head ritual Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what the purpose was a all\nTrump is still is reminding everybody what she said\nShe doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking Kristin balls the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying well this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again\nTrump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility even later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right to oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes that initial statement on somebody and he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has had this continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's if it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors oh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not blocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply boy she she can't backup she

National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them\nOnto the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the ribs then is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something to be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this um [noise] ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was a and even if it if you can even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the uh [noise]\nOccupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to get that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate at ...\n... ... ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various uh jumped\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the Ford\nWill end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case can be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same\nThing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nAh all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points\nSo the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination in racism all of this the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's going to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\n\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nI did you get home I don't remember how did you get there

out there he's saying things like\nSome Democrats have no soul their mothers must not a breast fed them they don't care who gets destroyed Dr Ford her confidentiality her family they don't care if capital and gets destroyed\nThis is John Kennedy Republican U.S senator from Louisiana some of my colleagues on the Democrat side are in good faith some I'm convinced\nDon't even have a soul their mothers didn't breast feed them they didn't have to they what their raw meat they went right the raw meat they don't care who gets destroyed Dr Ford or her confidentiality her family they don't care

you can't believe any of them who are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while you are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me to\nKind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine Kennan this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class that all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the\nCause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that memory I have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um [noise] uh your rights sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the right hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine if not better I by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly includes all women women on across America who do not think this way or being lumped into this movement\nAgainst
