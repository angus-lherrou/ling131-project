that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer for herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are soon to be embarking on what a stadium tour\nOr yes bill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if Trump

anywhere near the wake of Donald Trump you know what\nThis is like is it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some ... the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as

thing and it never has happened\nEvery attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want that you may think rush them enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks\nYou may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to

did a Google Search\nFor news of the secret video from project Vera toxic Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nVery task news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ me the Breitbart News you know cure report but there is no way piece here\nWhy there is no New York times here there's no St Louis Post Dispatch here there was no

but we're covering that by me doing it now um there's nothing Yahoo News nothing\nNot one drive by or mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project merits us every site running this would\nBe a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is as McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe\nCan't openly says that says whatever age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff\nTalking to the on identified project Vera toss secret journalist and in this particular song by Senator McCaskill\nAre

might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get votes on this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows\nHe just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are total NRA folks\nThe Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\nI voted for getting rid of ... what what about high capacity magazine I have voted for most of those they absolutely get rid of high capacity magazine ... what about for an outright ban oh yeah\nAnd not right now oh yeah\nYou'll never hear Claire McCaskill campaign this way [noise] she'll say in fact that\nShe's very open to the idea of bump stocks yeah might have to get rid of the everybody's on board but uh getting rid of bump stocks but start talking about limiting bags and banning things are really can't say might lose votes in the Boot Hill\nBut you know what she said about that she said if we can really sweep up in St Louis if we can clean up the story I could I could lose some votes in the boot heel\nSo you people in the Boot Hill in Missouri and that's where my mom when my mom was

F. A. B. I. highway yeah [noise]\n... and welcome back okay somebody asked me a good question about the watch the apple watch worn by July August Shelby [noise] crush what about why fight a good question [noise] the way why fight\nOn the apple watch works is this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThe the watch is always a slave to the phone so that the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... connectivity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using ... to connect\nOr even an L. P. E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by blue ...\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on the wife I network the watch is capable of white five but only if\nThe iPhone that it's paired June knows that why fight network\nFor example when I'm at home uh I leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connects the white fine\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe fire on the watch learns it but I still I had to manually answer\nThe why fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the ah the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... I've got a wife ... what the hell's going on so I checked that I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I network on my watch\nWhat I doubt that\nYour mouth to show these phone had why fight connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required and his wife just sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password the phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone doesn't connect you with the watch will\nNot\nNow if he had a history of going into that conflict with this phone and if I Want a previous visit he had logged into their wife I network with a password\nThen his watch one connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered the wife I network password on his watch that just the phone is not\nNearby I just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech\nIt is possible that his watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually entered the consulates wife fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been long gone with the password does not mean to watch as\nEvery device connecting to a wife\nHalf to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got to really simplified here you know you'll people may not notice it may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncle leaks house\nAnd uncles IQ has a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that oh go leaks phone will get his alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and my uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the gas didn't say it will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as an Iowa eleven\nYou should try to see if you don't notice\nIt's fascinating it's it's uh it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that ... would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates isn't ... on his watch\nEven if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife ... worker access at if he'd done that if his watch works on why fight it meant constantly than he would have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\n\nOne of the car had wife I Know it it it did it because he's the pardon me out of range for it up until this visit was probably will find empty okay who knows\nBut I doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to heading or not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this as if he was probably know find the empty okay who knows\nBut I doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um\nLook in another example of try to explain that you go to a city and you get an a car picks you up at the airport or whatever and the car service has wife I it it it's just a hot spot\nThe driver gives you the password if you're not sort of your log into it you're watching is not logging on to the network your ... your watch is connecting to the phone the phone and controls your watch as long as the tour in range\nThe phone determines everything that watch those when they are separated when the watches out a range of the phone that's when you have to know how the watch can independently connect the networks and I've just got through telling you how difficult it is\nWhen there's no way out to eat an apple has not activated L. P. E. service for watches in Turkey yet so it would have had to have been wife I went ahead of in the white find that work at a concert and it would have had to have a password entered on that watch\nI'm saying the odds of this\nI don't think most people with a watch nowhere to go into the password nor how to do it you can't dictate that you have to you have to use the rebel app and use your finger to draw individually every character that's in the password", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "16"}
