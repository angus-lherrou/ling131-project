five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight\nTo zero now to talk to me about the link between vitamin D\nIn body weight what's the research showing\nWell that is maybe fifty studies out there that show a real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the\nHigher your vitamin D the less you with but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues same clues that we know what about mood that is people who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the equator people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitudes\nMost people experience has people way less than the summer than they do in the winter so those were closed but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ...\nThat's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last year they studied women who were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and takes lost more weight than the women really had the lower vitamin D and takes yes\nAnd then just a couple of months ago\nA randomized double blind placebo controlled trial that's the highest standard of proof we have and medicine and this was thirty six thousand people\nAnd they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect is but the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take ... to Monday\nSo that's another reason plots since purity is giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the fish will you know of course that there's research that shows that fish or in a self help with weight control\nSo there's reasons to believe that two things together will

you very much for being with us this week on community matters\nI thank you so much next up on community matters this week I Want to welcome back to the program the executive director of the ... foundation Julian ... is with us here\nOn community matters and Julia thanks for coming back yeah thanks for having me\nWe had a tremendous long conversation a few weeks ago mhm uh during the month of September and suicide prevention mutt about the issues of suicide when the perspective of someone who knows someone who might be dealing with it or is someone who might\nBe dealing with it and we mentioned during that conversation there wasn't a vet coming up on October and now here we are almost here in the deadline to make your reservation for this is just a couple of days away so\nLet's talk about this event a time for hope and healing coming up on a Tuesday October sixteenth so just days away what's going on on this date that people need to make a reservation for two days\nYes we are going to have Patrick Kennedy with us at our annual event at time for helping healing at the end of the liver fat and Patrick and yes he has one of those Kennedy's we've gotten a lot of question to see from the Kennedy who he I don't think the one in that same yeah\nI'm so he has struggled and very publicly um with mental health concerns and substance he says she is and\nAnd has told his story many many times just publicly trying to change the public conversation\nUm and really help even when he was still in Congress he was you know pushing bills that would really help Americans in this area and so and obviously the family\nAs a whole has really struggled and so he's very transparent with that story he just wants to make sure that others here it and and get the help that they need as well and that funding and research on a federal level are pushed toward that says we have like all other medical concerns\nYeah it's it's a big story when a member of Congress decides to drive to his office one night and try and go through the barricades around the Capitol building just do it yet as their congressmen Kennedy did on on one night\nA course that story is amplified by a million when the candidate who's doing this\nHe uh how was it that the Kim foundation an organization we'll talk about here in a moment been around for almost Twenty years mhm how was how was it that you thought to invite in or did he approach you for this or that\nKnow we had a patched him I've actually heard him six or seven times throughout the country over the last ... years\nAnd he's just so passionate about the issue and I've made a joke kind of that he's still like he's on the floor still trying to get a bell path is just like it's his passion is palpable and it's just his story is so impactful and and many can relate to not necessarily being a Kennedy but to the struggles that he faced in the family concerns that he had and so\nUm we approached him feeling like it really aligned with our mission and what we're trying to do here in a local level and he was very happy to oblige and will be here um and really to a he'll take a full hour and tell his story um will also have\nHis book a common struggle that really dives into that a little more as well so I'm\nTrying to remember the family tree has a right okay um for for those who because as I'm sure you know ... everything is\nPolitical or those expecting this to be a raw ... out of the other ... the other political right no that's not what this has been\nNo absolutely not politics will not play into whatsoever and you know that really goes along with our beliefs and mental illness and and suicide that it impacts everybody no matter what side of the aisle no matter what part of the community or in um it is something that touches all of us and so no politics will not be of a raise it all that day or\nSo even if the the issue of mental health and suicide prevention isn't one that might get you just have to go to someplace and having not be above\nPolitics or no or low now what are what an oasis right reversal any but he would also for the social media for an hour to him yes that that's true I Am a rest but but you are for those who want to attend this of it is it's got to be close to sort of\nYeah we we have a great attendance we've broken records from our past year so we still have a few seats left as well though and um you know we've had people come as a family and purchase a table and they want to bring family members to it and we have corporations coming we have individual so really it is open to anyone who's interested\nUm we have school district sending educator so his wife really focuses on school and mental health and so it's a nice tie in there as well but if you go to a\nWebsite that came foundation dot org you can get registered\nFor the lunch in itself and again he'll be speaking for about sixty minutes then we'll have a an award I'm ceremony for a few law enforcement officers here from Omaha area that have either saved her life we can't really give it away yet um but been involved in suicide prevention and posted bench an effort to in our community\nBut what a great idea to get law enforcement of all yeah yeah because\nYou know like you they deal with this all the time and ... you just don't think about it when it comes to law enforcement or let's talk about your job for a moment she that give director at the ... foundation for seven years now mhm organizations been around for about Eighteen mhm why is this issue of suicide prevention so important to a huge\nMhm um well from the foundation perspective ah we're we're named in memory as Larry Clinton and his daughter Kim\nI'm he's the founder of CNN industries and he vowed um unfortunately I guess I should backup in case they didn't less than a couple of weeks ago but\nI'm Kim had a mental illness and unfortunately took her life by suicide and at that time the family that when they're able to give back in a meaningful impact the way this would be um their mission and they're just they're focus area\nAnd they've really done that for Eighteen years and are very strong supporter and the community on a personal level I like many have been touched by friends who we've lost a suicide and family members who have suffered significantly from mental illness and so\nI just I think this is super important I think it's important for everyone to really come to the table we can all play a role in this and and help others because they are out there and they need it\nI imagine it's incredibly rare to find someone who has it been touched by a a close family member or friend work associates but it's\nYeah and it's interesting because when you ask a question about suicide or even mental illness in general um if you depending on the audience if you ask the question has been touched by this\nUm you know it's kind of crickets at first but then one once somebody is brave enough to tell their story the ripple effect happens and everyone in the room is talking about what my sister my friend my brother you know whatever it may be\nUm and it's not always suicide it can be depression that can be invited can be many many things um but once one person tells her story we usually find the others come to the table to tell their\nAnd so the organization that Kim foundation on light up the Kim foundation dot org again for those who didn't here are longer conversation and and if you'd like to hear the longer conversation let me just tell you where you can find it go to KFC duck on\nThe news radio
