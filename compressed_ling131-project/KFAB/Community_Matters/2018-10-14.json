announcement from the U.S department of health and Human Services would dump us gifts and the ad council\nFrom the studios got you covered this news radio eleven and KFC be formal and I heard radio station [noise]\n[noise] his community matters poll weekly public affairs program to reform and entertain you with some of the Greek people organization an event in and around Omaha\nNow here's the hosted the program from news radio eleven ten cafe be godfather he\nAnd thank you so much for being a part of the program this week we get to tell you about an event coming up later this month on Sunday October twenty eighth the children's business fair is coming up and this is all headed up by Rachel Benson who joins us now Rachel thanks for being a community\nMatters You're welcome for having me children's business fair now as I understand that we have child labor laws in this country we're going to business or we're pushing them to\nUh you know it's really it's really a chance for them to\nThink about who am I what gifts do I have what impact could I actually step out and making the world even though I'm a kid or how what ages are we looking at a ages five to Seventeen so the whole gamut\nIs this really just a way for adults to get ideas on what they want to do what they are alive [laughter] go talk to a bunch of seven year old see what they want to uh you\nKnow it's interesting I think that as adults we can get detached from maybe maybe even are calling you know what gets us excited to get out get out of bed each morning as we get into that that\nThe whole regime yes the wheel of life\nWhere we have to get in and and just make make ends meet and um so I think we do and we meet a kid who was on fire about something they're excited about ah it can help us remember what was I thought when I was a kid you know maybe I should actually think what is my calling for my life\nAnd my my son is eight years old he already has his whole life laid out including\nHow he's going to overlap is professional sports season I'm going to leave the football team\nAnd I got to go to the playoffs at the baseball team but then joined the basketball team by the time the all star break is there you know unless we're in the super bowl then you know he's got it all laid out and I I don't have the heart to tell him that sorry with me is your father you know the way professional sports\nNow and go watch some games but uh it is it's fun to see the kids enthusiasm\nUm I'd like to tell you that it was enough we had enough room in the in and everyone had a bed and everyone had a bedroom but it's not the case we are in overflow so I'm On any given night will have mats on the floor\nAnd but we don't have to try and he went away and that's important to me as a mother when you have someone seeking shelter for domestic violence or really regardless whatever that reason is who cares it's somebody that's seeking to stab their basic needs met we need to make room for them\nWe serve a lot of meals you know that I Do you um it you know amazingly it's a lot more fun to peel potatoes and cook them and serve them and leaving led to clean up\nTo you [laughter] uh shows like at home I'm much\nBetter in our kitchen than your own when you're serving someone else because that the grateful someone who's appreciative and\nUm we actually serve anywhere from Twenty one hundred twenty seven hundred meals a day and Ninety percent of our food is donated we have a fourteen thousand square foot garden and a greenhouse so we're growing fruit and vegetables ten months of the year\nI'm One of our other big programs is homeless prevention because I'm really passionate about it\nDoesn't matter if it's an every day almost prevention or Sallah days we're coming up to a time where it's Thanksgiving and I know you as a mom and I we want to be at our family and friends we want to keep tradition we want to bring everyone together and just celebrate our blessings\nAnd just because you live in poverty doesn't mean that you don't have that want to\nUh you just may not be able to provide for that you're living from paycheck to paycheck\nAnd um although a turkey may not be very much for me and you to buy ... it's a ... you have to make a choice um to purchase it and either put gas in your car to go to work keep your lights on um whether you pay your rent\nAnd so um our trucking fixing program offer Thanksgiving is a huge program and it's all new this year which I Am super excited about\nBecause you know when you go to the grocery store you try to choose things your children like to eat of course is our favorite vegetable mhm well me too don't give me corn if I'm In need because my kids wouldn't eat it Gina and so this year for a turkey and fix this program\nEveryone gets choice they get to choose their vegetables they kept to choose their grain\nAnd they it's so much more dignified\nAnd I'm really excited about it I'm I'm overwhelmed too because I'm not sure what it's going to look like can you oh gosh what if we run out a stove top what if you run out of rice\nGod will provide it'll be okay and then for our project Santa program totally do to work spending um we used to have just aren't came and they picked up an assembled toy bag\nNow we tried to do our best by age and gender\nBut I don't know about you you have boys I have to and and you know they're all different\nAnd even my daughter if you would have given me an age appropriate makeup kit she doesn't wear it well prom and homecoming right exceptions\nBut she would have rather I Would have chosen soccer ball so again expanding projects you know this year for the first time we're actually families an evil choose\nThe ten to twelve twice items for their family to take home to wrap them to be under the tree for their celebration whether it be Christmas Hanukkah or something else but again that respected bringing respect and dignity back\nInto people's lives are so important\nI don't think people maybe ... I Know you and we're friends and I know a lot of the things that you do but I think you do way more than people even you know you were just telling me a minute ago you don't know what day to day is going to be like tell me about\nLike a day you know at the opener mission we have over forty programs that we offer for free or one of our biggest passions to break the cycle of homeless and poverty is education\nAnd so we have over a hundred adults in GED we have ... training with forklift certification Bob have certification and so you have all these different things that are being pulled from whether it be\nA base meeting people's basic needs are life transformation but at the end of the day the bottom line is you have to keep the lights on food on the table and the toilet flushing I mean when you have a thousand people coming in and out of you\nSo ... those are kind of important things to keep going right and so probably you know one of the biggest things for me as I could be getting up early in the morning to go in an open maybe a chamber meeting or speak about homeless in poverty\nUm I could do lunch meeting with a group of women um and in between that I'm trying to balance the budget find out where I'm going to make more asks for that to keep the cash coming in to pay the bills on time or we don't spend money we don't have\nAnd then at the same time um you know in the afternoon I can be running to an after school pub maybe for each meeting um because we really believe that through a advocacy and teaching people and empowering them to know the real reasons why someone is is homeless or the factors that are contributing\nThat they'll not only support us but they'll make better choices themselves and I wanted to bring\nThat up because for those who are maybe more jaded they think well these people are just you know they're just not working and I just don't want to work or they just you know this type of thing what would you say to\nTo those people well success looks different especially if you don't know what how to define success you know in our after school program I'll never forget when me she told me that his sister's got it going on\nAnd I have to sit down and say explain that to me and he said oh miss Candace um she's got a I I mean and for me ... I'll be honest I was trying to comprehend it as well because\nHis sister had been doing so well in our after school program back in ... in school I'm being an honor student it Benson Hi I'm being a cheerleader and then she got pregnant and dropped out of school and the you know what I mean she she said miss Kansas but she's got a full purchase food and doesn't have to live with my crack head mom anymore so to him that with success\nAnd so sometimes you have to know you have to empathize with people and understand where they're coming from and know that two opportunities people can see a different definition of success and that's what we're trying to do\nAnd speaking of opportunities you have so many different opportunities for people to give for people to volunteer for families to voluntarily our family\nFriendly and have ten thousand volunteers that donate two hours of their time each month\nAnd it's not enough I Can't believe that it's not enough it's not meeting all the meats I'm from going out on the streets delivering sack lunches and toiletry kit to people living on the streets trying to build a relationship and friendship with them to bring them back again if you'd have teenagers and you're listening\nAnd they think they don't have enough or they need that they've been displaced or to inconvenience because the remote spot working on their MP three or therapy has three or whatever you\nCall that Bob [laughter] whatever it is yes [laughter] you to\nCome down and volunteer in the street program because when you're driving away from the ... experience your your children are saying wow I've got a really good I didn't know how good habits\nAnd um that's some of the some of the time when we have fallen tears come it's always because they want to make a difference for someone else but they don't realize the impact is going to be on their own life\nSo I really encourage people to visit our website and come for a tour and see for themselves because sometimes I say oh what about being a tutor what about being in the kitchen or being in our holiday assistant program you know when they have a tour something ... interest them and I'm like wow that's what I Want to be involved in yeah\nSo lots of ways to volunteer just go to your website and I have a link that he's that suits you we have a new website were really excited\nAbout it it's easy to navigate the first\nTime but if you click on open door mission dot org and click on about us you can find out more about what we do every day and then you can swap over to the volunteers section and we've made it so easy to you know we have walk ins are welcome ... volunteer form you could just show up at these locations at this time and make a difference\nUm we also have our holiday volunteer opportunities and then of course our month to month a hundred years or volunteer from home I had a group that just delivered a hundred jars of sunshine yesterday and they get it from home\nA it's a four H. club and they put together a little a missionary jars and they put the candy and the little words that just said your special you are in love and so when are we can give us that when people are having a bad day I Need a jar of sunshine I especially with all the rain I Am\nLike there's I mean if you if we're not your passion there's something else that is there's nothing like making a difference in our community there's so many opportunities\nTo tell you how much I admire you you do so much for the community and so do your your does your staff and volunteers at the open door ... team we had a great family um I have four children they've grown up at the mission they're best napkin pass routers\nAnd I've got a forklift driver and I did an amazing Lee loves\nTo use a dishwasher at the mission not so much at home Candice thank you so much it's so nice talking to you for the opportunity you back\nThe next step on community matters I Want to welcome you to an expanded feature on this show called CEO you should know and to introduce you this week to this particular CEO this is Travis Miller is the c._e._o. a profile by Sanford was several locations around town drivers\nAppreciate you being here on community matters like sure I've got to talk to you here about not just who you are but what you do from a community matters type of standpoint the issue of\nDiet or exercise of physical and emotional wellbeing and how that inner place\nThat's something I think you're really uniquely positioned to speak about because you know how important it is to the people you served tell me about profile by Sanford and what you do and then we'll talk about how you served as individuals so a profile by sand for we always say we're", "show_name": "Community Matters", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "14"}
