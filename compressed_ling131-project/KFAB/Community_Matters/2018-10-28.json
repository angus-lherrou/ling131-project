H. I. helps thank you so much for being a part of the program this week for the opportunity for us to talk about the downtown arena there see HI health centers all over town but now we have a C H I help center center right\nHow did that come to pass so why is it important for your organization to have the naming rights on the downtown arena convention center\nWhile I'm Scott the way it came to pass was or that we're actually approached by the consulting firm that back ahead engaged as they were looking for a new partner for uh the uh the center for was the century like center\nAnd quite honestly initially we were I'm not sure that it would be something that would make sense from our organizations perspective but as we went through the process and we thought more about what are we as a health care system could do with that partnership or we became more and more excited about the opportunity\nOr ... for us and the reason that it's important is really two fold or one of which is that a bad relationship gives us a chance to utilize that partnership with mecca and use that building an facility in ways\nThat it hadn't are probably hasn't been used before and that would be unique and different from a health care perspective we we absolutely believe that healthcare education is critically important\nAnd a while I I I I Can't give away any of our secrets just yet you'll see us and you'll see C. H. I. health using that relationship or in ways that are that may surprise\nUm and they travel the country and do you know speaking events and support events and go to different races to be displayed it's just kind of a you know we're fortunate with a three and a half million miles traveled daily we've got these rolling billboards that we can kind of message on matters of importance and so we want to use them\nAbsolutely my mom for breast cancer survivor so I Want to ... for that really need that that you do that and you do so much for the community I really admire back and forth like yours that you know just give back even more than they get from the community and and you have even more things that you do\nYeah we try him in just a part of our corporate values\nUm that we've been really emphasizing with our associates has is centered around community so the base of our sort of value structure is integrity and then as you look at the pillars of our values the center values community\nWe believe that we've got to make the communities in which we work better than we found them um I think trucking sometimes has a bad reputation and a lot of it's based on thirty forty years ago kind of data\nUm but we think that uh you know the the people we work with an employer release all to the earth so we want to make a difference and so we you know one of the things that I'm proudest of is um our bluebird game so we lost a program several years ago where associates all around our network and sign up to be part of our bluebirds aid\nAnd they're really available to charities to be utilized to go out and offer manpower and assistance and we work with habitat for humanity used emergency services\nUh American Heart association AOL lessen the list goes on and on the simply make a request of organization and we send out you know what is often harder to get the money is the actual physical people\nUm and we want to provide that venue because we've got a young workforce and although we have many people that do a lot financially to support local charities and national charities sometimes it's not just the money it's it's the time and they want to really be hands on and so the blue brigade given that opportunity\nJust to go out and all all in in a in a day's work for you [laughter] that's right I'm sure you've had a great support system now that helps with all that\nYes we have a we have a team of people and actually ... coordinates a lot of our other charitable activities including the review of or charitable donations and so we do you know we like I said it's financial it's time it's it's across the board and then of course we're corporate partner with the United way and that's a right now we're in the United way fundraising fundraising drive\nAnd um you know that's something we're committed to we're going to continue to try to set new records with our contributions to the United way and all the good they do in the community\nUm last thing we do I think it's kind of need and so I I Want to talk about it because other companies have adopted this after hearing about our program\nBut we have an employer relief on at Warner and so every employee at the beginning every year can make a certain amount of their paycheck go to a general fund and then the company matches that dollar for dollar and it goes into an employer employee relief fund\nSo that when people encounter kind of one off or once in a lifetime kind of tragedies house burns down\nFlooding whatever the case may be and they work at Warner we have our own internal sort of giving mechanism\nThat that that is always funded and we have an internal committee that manages that money and that supports our drivers mechanics office associates anybody going through a traumatic experience they can kind of get into that to get to the tough time and and really try to help them out in a more kind of structured way than just trying to pass the had after the fact\nMy gosh I'm so glad you came in today I you know I Know that you contribute to the community a lot in volunteerism and ... monetary and all the things that you're doing but that's pretty amazing pretty exceptional I Would say\nWell thank you I mean everybody has to do their part so that is true I mean describe to ours\n[laughter] Derek thank you so much for coming into that like a pleasure talking to you absolutely thanks for having me\nThat's Gina melting you find her with Steve London every weekday morning on cat one oh three part of our eye heart media Omaha\nRadio family once again I'm Scott vorhees from news radio eleven ten K. F. A. B. you're listening to community matters we welcome into our studios here at ... Omaha the chairman president and CEO of woman life one of the more iconic companies here in my hometown of Omaha so it's a pleasure to welcome ... days\nYou're on CEO you should know pat thank you very much for being a part of this well thanks for having us I think it's always great when you have someone who is the c._e._o. of a company who has worked his way up over several years with the company why don't you give us a little insight as to how you got to be the c._e._o. of women life\nWell it's a it's an interesting story um actually my father worked for the organization in time I was four years old a became adults I gotta do what I gotta do to make a living uh and so I followed that pursuit of passion and went to work for wouldn't in life are just completed my thirtieth year with what\nIs that all is that all is starting to sound like a career\nAnd actually a you know the one of the great things about our organization that actually started as a sales representative worked my way up through leadership ranks uh except the different assignments around the country are moved I'm All right at ten years ago\nYeah this was an all in Omaha you know some people might not realize a woman life is more than just an iconic building in downtown Omaha ... fingers all over the globe doesn't it\nUh actually it's all domestic wherever they were were do operations in all fifty states you know the strength of our membership and presidents is mainly down throughout the southeast are from Texas all the way up into the Carolinas around that belt mhm\nNow at what point did you start thinking as you were working your way up in the company you know I could see myself you know in the penthouse sweet or here at this company some day\nWell I Would have to say that was not on the road map from where I was at vantage point you know I'd love to working directly with the you know our members you know the people from our community to uh to do what we do we think that\nA life insurance and retirement products that we offer is is a tremendous social service and so I've really enjoyed being embraced with that in our paternal programs that we\nHave ah endeavor to do since we reformed in Nineteen Ninety\nOr you know what it's about uh twelve fourteen years ago I was approached about moving to Omaha Nebraska and taking on a larger role in uh I saw this new challenge and you know I've been mentored well by a lot of people in this industry and and scientific that challenge\nWas your dad still part of the company by the time you got to be CEO\nYeah it is kind of an interesting turn of events uh you know I wound up being his boss at some point but ah my father retired uh any completed fifty years of service this August so he retired in August\nYeah does he call you up and make suggestions yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you have what are you doing why don't you try things this\nWay whose idea was that right now he's he's been my greatest a mentor and and uh really been very supportive\nOr you know he he told us um I have two older brothers and younger sister he told us a\nYou know about choice you know you can make choices in life and you know the choices I've made a sometimes involve risk because you move your family around the country uh in pursuit of professional while roles and um you know there's there's choices a at times are tough but look back and you know I've got great friends who I consider family\nIn the places I've lived um originally from outside of Houston I Lived in Sacramento, California for a while in Tallahassee, Florida in Albany, Georgia before moving here to Omaha and you know I've really learned to love this community a ... a great place to live and raise a family\nPet day is is with us here the c._e._o. of what's been life it must be really easy to direct people to the offices downtown Omaha I just looked at the skyline see that big building that says wouldn't may not all four sides just come in the front doors\nYou know that's a ... it's we kinda tease about that because that is iconic you know back when that building was built in Nineteen sixty nine and it started a revitalization of downtown\nAnd ah it was the tallest building a for many many years and you know the building itself or is not the entity it's not the enterprise ah you know it's down to the good work some of the things that we do a but it does ah it helps to point out that's where it's at a you know it's one of those things that\nWe consider ourselves a unfortunately in some ways to be the best kept secret or because our organization or if there's so many great things is just not everyone is fully aware of exactly what women as in what they do sure I think\nA lot of people understand the insurance aspect of it but as you point out here it's so much more than that with the community involvement engagement that you're involved in something that you worked with quite a bit in in moving up the ranks of this company give people an idea of what would have been life is all about besides selling insurance\nSure you know the organization was founded a there's actually a brass plaque on the um the hotel the Paxton downtown\nOrganization was founded in June sixth of Eighteen Ninety um we've chosen for our home office headquarters to be here since that day you know the organization was founded on a dual purpose you know to stand to aid the afflicted which we do with our insurance products but also to for the betterment of community\nOr you know organizations unique in the insurance space it's a five oh one C. eight which is a not for profit enterprise ah and exists for the benefit of its members and so organization has not only the protection products and the the opportunity to help people develop retirement income\nBut at the on the other hand you know we are committed to communities and making a better community on the focus of family community in country\nYou know our organization or back or the president and CEO of organization back in Nineteen forty seven I was a little disappointed in the waning nationalism post World war two and established a are patriotic program\nIn which we will give away United States flags free of charge to schools churches clubs organizations we surpassed that are three million flag donated and this last year", "show_name": "Community Matters", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha",
