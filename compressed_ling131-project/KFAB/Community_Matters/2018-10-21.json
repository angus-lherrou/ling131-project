and entertain you with some of the Greek people organization an event in and around Omaha now here's the hosted the program from news radio eleven ten half ab staff or heat\nAnd thank you so much for being a part of our program this week on this I heart media Omaha radio station I had a chance to a few days ago on my program on\nNews radio eleven ten K. F. A. B. to talk with a very special member of our community Aspen Siemens mom Lisa semen you remember the story Aspen\nWas lost in the summer of two thousand sixteen and in the wake of that tragedy come as a really cool thing that the community can partner with Lisa and the Aspen Drake semen foundation on to bring something really positive out of that in his name\nI talked about it with Lisa this past week thank you for having me there's another event coming up here to honor Aspen and just even though it's hard for all of us to hear just ... just remind a certain case people just moving to the area here in the last year or so tell me about Aspen\nSo Afghan passed\nAway in June of two thousand sixteen he drowned in our backyard lake um and obviously very devastating for our family ah he was our lights and an amazing little boy he was three and a half and\nYou know after his passing we decided we had two routes we kick out we had basically give out and just be devastated and and or we could take it and and do something positive with his life\nIt's it's amazing how you can draw courage and and and and draw from the spirit of three and a half year old kid\nWho still learning how to do so many things in this world but it seems like one thing that children don't need to be taught how to do and that is to wake up every day with the excitement for life and all of that how much did you draw on the short time you had with Aspen to kind of determine how you were going to move forward\nNext up on the program this week we welcome back to community matters Justin Dougherty as with is the executive director of the autism action partnership online\nAt autism action dot org Justin is good to have you back on the program yeah it's great to be here thanks there is an event coming up on November sixteenth we want people to be aware of but first what's going on with autism action partnership and everything you guys are working on\nA yeah so we are a on a program or an agency that serves the entire state of Nebraska a we have a a couple of focus areas one of which is connecting families with resources so simply put\nA your child is diagnosed with autism and you have a thousand questions and maybe a hundred answers while we hope that we can be the first call for help to say\nHere's who else is doing the work in town what can we offer you what are other agencies doing how do you talk to school or family or or or any part of your network about what\nWhat you guys are going through or how you're going to go to navigate these water is a industries that we have a workforce development program because of the evolution of autism and the when the diagnosis really started to kind of be more widespread about twenty Thirty years ago\nYou're seeing a lot of young adults finishing high school and their parents are saying what is our next step in the answer is\nKind of whatever it is you guys can put together so uh we're trying to work on a we do have a workforce development program to try to connect individuals who were finishing high school and maybe do some postsecondary training but are looking to get into the workforce and so we have job coaches and employers willing and looking to hire individuals on the spectrum\nYeah you're right in the last twenty to Thirty years that there's been a lot more attention paid because there's been a lot more cases fades known we've all as a society learn more about this of course parents who have had children's diagnosing that spectrum\nThat a crash course in learning but you've got to have as well you've been the executive director of the autism extra partnership really really short time you've been on this program another capacity right uh so what has been the biggest thing that you've had to kind of\nHave your crash course in learning about you know everything that\nAutism means it's it's one word but it means so many different things right\nAh the technical a diagnosis has autism spectrum disorder right and the words spectrum is so critical that you could put ten people in a room with autism and have ten completely different experiences based on that spectrum\nAnd so uh well we have a network of families in a community that we're trying to build of individuals experiencing autism\nThose experience or a wide reaching wide ranging from your three year old who you're thirty year old from uh individuals who are maybe have a ... or some stunted social skills to individuals who are non verbal uh it ... it's so wide ranging so there is not just an autism\nRight I was kind of like cancer and it takes on a lot of different forms as effects and different people and none of it as anything that you want to deal with but there are different ways of dealing with the different for ice so since that's the case with autism and you have this employee ability aspect of what you do and well\nThis must be a staff of a million people and a trillion dollars that you're working with Bill to do all this right\nNow yeah and I are working on that and I were a small but mighty right now are we really do leverage a lot of the resources in town there are other fantastic organizations that serve individuals' either specifically with all its has autism or a developmental disabilities in general and were able to kind of leverage some of those resources\nSo what are some of the things that people with autism are able to do that maybe some people might be surprised by right\nSo I always preface this statement with because of the spectrum I'm going to go kind of in the bell curve where the the greatest amount of ... would be a what we see across the country is a a jobs where there's repetition where there is a real kind of a standard understanding of what the steps are if you can tell me the Fifteen steps I Need to follow every single day\nSitting at the same spot doing this type of work I Will know what I'm coming into every day it's a warm blanket for individuals are on the spectrum a lot of times they liked the knowing everything that they can about something a\nAnd we work at the recycling group in town and they say you could you could give them the instructions teach them and train them in five years later they're following the same exact uh steps there at the same table they're doing it in there and they're happy\nIt's when you go to lunch break when they have the social skills the so the kind of we say the work is play for them and play as work so it's the social interaction is when you start to see more of their autism kind of manifest in the work or they can be some of your greatest workers\nI see I never really thought of it that way in terms of the workplace mhm I'm so when when someone when you're talking to an employer about hiring some of these rituals how then is that social aspect dealt with\nA variety of ways I think a first and foremost\nOur our message to employers is we're trying to find you an employee that's going to be able to do a task do it well and be one of your star performers\nI'm ... there's a we don't want the undercurrent of charity right where you're like you were given this person opportunity and it feels good that's great but that's not going to keep job retention there's gonna be two or three people there that this is wonderful and the other teams it'd be like\nYeah but we need to get the work done so uh this is about finding their skill set that matches the the skill needs so uh from that point um we work with a we have some training that we offer so our staff will go in and either work directly with a supervisor\nAnd our uh our clients on on how to interact in the in the proper ways if you're going to be late what do you do if you've got a concern um many individuals spectrum are are strict rules followers if you tell them\nA B C D they will do that if they see their co worker go a CBD they're going to be like that that they're doing it right correct so a socially that might cause some friction in right or at lunch break when there's us or maybe a a perceived\nSocial situation that maybe doesn't go the way uh those uh those was down in the spectrum would assume it would go oh those are opportunities for learning opportunities for friction so we also offer department trainings will work with maybe three or four staff or an entire organization\nA lot of diversity and inclusion efforts kind of are starting to evolve to a place where the disability\nUm populations being included you know now so uh there's a lot of for going forward thinking organizations that are saying we want more and we want different and uh our autism a population is a it brings a really unique difference to a to an organization\nTalking here with Justin ... executive director of the autism action partnership again the website is autism action dot org you mentioned the the extra attention paid to the spectrum about Thirty years ago uh that line seems to be about the time that the movie Rainman came out for a lot of people was the only\nAutism that we knew right oh you have autism right you can count cards you take your brother your right across the country ... cards and make a bunch of money or you know that's obviously we've we've learned a lot since then but I think one of the reasons and tell me if I'm wrong\nOr that we have so much more attention paid to his not because suddenly they're all these new cases of autism is that is better diagnose now whereas before it was maybe thought of as behavioral disorder or something else\nThat's absolutely correct yes so I'm a autism is diagnosed mostly by behavior which makes it very unique so um some of the greatest minds to this day are still trying to kind of crack the autism code and we we are a bunch of list serves so we got emails every week every day about\nNew studies being done to understand what it is and how it manifests across the spectrum right so\nI it's not necessarily um uh you can't take a blood test or or some sort of exam or X ray or something to be like yeah there it is there is the autism right so a because it's behavioral as as pediatrics and pediatricians have been received a more intense training\nMore understanding as parents and individual start to have a better understanding of some of the signs early intervention or those diagnosis are happening more frequently\nA curious or because they're you know I in addition to hosting this program on all these I heart Meteo ... nations I'm also on a week days with nine eleven AM on news radio eleven ten K. F. A. B. and earlier this year for quite a long time\nThere was a public service announcement that we were running about the autism partnership and it was a couple of looking at a fairly newborn baby and they were concerned that he hadn't been smiling\nRight and they could be this could be that could be list and then finally at well if it'd be autism and this I mean we can do about it right and I listen to that and I think that's really interesting and I think\nWhat are you supposed to do about it you know is is it it's not like as you said they're like oh okay well we'll give them a shot will clear up and he'll get better I'll be fine right it was what what are you supposed to do about it if you have an infant and you know maybe it's autism or even up to you know a year or two\nRight um so the the first thing to do a and most important thing would be talk to your pediatrician about it a pediatricians almost every pediatrician office\nHas a hum of kind of a a few quick assessments those assessments aren't going to determine or diagnose anything but they will at least give them an indication of a if there's some things that they should be concerned about and then refer to um like Monroe Myers to three of them see you and him see is where\nA significant amount of those diagnosis are happening so or children's hospital places like that that have a specialist that will say there's enough here for us to want you to go just with like normal with any other medical condition I'm a generalist I have an understanding that this is enough of something that for you to hand it off to somebody else um\nThere are a number I think there's also a fear of autism right there's just like well I mean like it's not smiling or or they're not responding certainly don't want to hug\nAnd you're like oh no if it could be autism but it can be so many other things and and then that's where you want to get the medical intervention that can be um\nThey might have a you know these and have some hearing a worker some speech therapy and if not autism it's just they can't hear you as well as you think they can so especially as you as you well know when a child's a certain age until they get to a certain age that can't look at me like here's what's going on mom and dad they're just reacting to what's going on so um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Community Matters", "city": "Omaha", "day": "21"}
