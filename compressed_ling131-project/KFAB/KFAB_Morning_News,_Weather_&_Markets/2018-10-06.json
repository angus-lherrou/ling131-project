they pay the fee dot [noise] mourning\nMourning mourning this news radio eleven ten K. F. A. B. I Am a gift and filling in for Mr Dave ...\nOnce again second weekend on the radio and I ... you know Dennis I'm excited to be up at this hour I had a lot of fun doing this with you last weekend and even though it is my day to sleep and I'm Glad I could wake up and catch in the parking lot we can come in and talk for about an hour dad we almost with each other a\n... very slowly it would it would have been a very low bumper\nTo bumper I don't know that even call it an end to the average human scratched the car that I was driving it is a little bit bigger than the car I think mine might have just completely ate yours if we would have ... oh yeah yeah yeah definitely would have\nJust run over it you know what ... what was that not that\nIt's just a speed bump just a mere speed bumps and [noise]\nAll right before we went to the break I promised that we would spend more time talking about Kevin off the bottom of the hour whether or not you want to hear about a more we're going to talk about it because\nIt is the biggest news story over the last what twenty days he was nominated in July and since all this stuff came out about Ford it's been consuming the news waves ever since then\nBut first I wanted to jump into something even more exciting unemployment\nWho wants to talk about unemployment I understand that it's not the most exciting thing in the world but guys it is the\nLowest at three point seven percent since it has been in December of Nineteen sixty nine I Do have to admit that I don't remember that because I was not a live yet\nWe've got a ... it's been generations not years not decades generation since has been this low basically since the Korean and the Vietnam wars um it was lower in Nineteen fifty three and two point five percent\nBut something's got to be going right here if it's at three and a half or three point seven percent low since December of Nineteen sixty nine\nI'm Sorry to say but I think I think Dennis that Mr Donald Trump this might be proof that his economic promises are coming ... it's it's proof well something's happening something's happening\nOut there people are going to work they're going out there they're earning a living well and I believe or\nIn some cases wages are rising a little bit so that kind of giving people incentive to get back into the job market\nIncentive I like you know I have a I have a friend of mine that that runs a business and he talks about you know the about having having to increase wages right\nBecause now unemployment is is low going down which means that there's not as many people out there in the job pool searching for a job the competition to get employees\nQuality employees qualified employees whether it's a you know it's it's something that requires a college degree or not there there are jobs out there for people of all education levels\nAnd I think that that competition is good you know it's like a like you said wages are going up because they need to yeah\nI Believe uh I've heard that Amazon is raising their lowest wage up to like Fifteen\nFifteen dollars an hour and that was that's right I did read that story so Fifteen dollars an hour um everybody's going to even they're seasonal workers because obviously during the holiday season which I assume well they're probably already\nCamping up for it right they got to get ready and get all their warehouses and the shipping and I don't know how the juggernaut of a company operates from an operation standpoint but even there seasonal workers you know they're gonna start and no less than Fifteen dollars an hour\nOf course they've got billions in profits and so it doesn't hurt to invest it in your people\nNo that's not what those people with all these tax break that the evil heads of these companies get done is they are not re investing in their people and they're not you know because they can\nThey're not doing any kind of wage increases wait a second they have to because in order to get all the employees they have to raise the wages to be competitive in the job market filled the positions of need\nSo they also have incentive Oh absolutely\nYou know they're\nNot going to talk about what I Do for a whole lot but I Do I Do spend a lot of time with business owners here in Omaha and I actually do excuse me if I'm going to be repetitive I've heard Dave scream about this over the basically ever since I've known them and we've been on these subjects\nBut\nThere are tons of companies out there with this so unemployment low unemployment is great ended his proof that Donald Trump is doing something right or at least his team's doing something right to drive unemployment down but there's gotta be a split cited is corn as a business owner\nThe economy's great businesses are doing awesome young employment is down two thumbs up for America\nBut if you're if you're if you own a company and the employment rates down I mean that that means it's hard to get harder to get workers you know I Know I've talked to many business owners that say that they could overnight tomorrow and the next five days and the next week the very short term\nCould could because the demand is there they can grow their company by thirty percent\nGrow their company about thirty percent they could reinvest in their company go out there provide more widgets do more great services for people but because unemployment so low because the job market is so competitive which again I'm a fan of let's make things more competitive you know it's hard to find quality workers and I believe\nThat might be where a decent immigration policy might come in a immigration policy\n[noise]\nWell I mean I guess that's the kind of an oxymoron decent immigration\nImmigration policy why why would you propose such a crazy\nPlan than is you know there that's holding a rebel we need more workers any more quality workers I Believe that these business owners also okay quality workers right\nI I Believe these business owners Dennis if people would show up come to work show up\nOn time you act like they wanted to be there that even if they weren't necessarily have the background knowledge to be quote unquote qualified\nPerson to do whatever job it is that these business owners I Believe that these business owners because they have they have some extra capital the economy's doing great there but then says what's driving that they might they just might you know invest some time and some training\nIn some of these less qualified employees maybe they just showed up on time maybe they if maybe they you know every single day got one percent better\nI think I think that I think they might do it\nBut [noise] All right is that attempted problem is you have to get people to show up\nOr\nSo does the unemployment talk coming up after this\nI'm going to ... going to jump right into sports because other than Nebraska playing Wisconsin today there's actually some pretty good story is going on with the old\n...
