{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "With the do it yourself investor watches a TV show or read one article and goes and makes a trade and sells cars they're picking up something and they want it to because somebody made an emotional base decision so we as humans this is very normal\nWe where emotions on her sleep so of course of the fact that goes up or happy we're celebrating were actually look at our accounts less but when the stock market was down\nWe're concerned scared anxious nervous all those things that come with it and so making sure you just have the right asset allocation plan in place and really a gym I went to the right game plan in place is something every investor should be doing well\nAnd and sticking with that game plan and I and I'll use a a football analogy I'm surprised yeah I Know I don't know that you used to be an coach football coach saucer that with and that's why I Love football I Love football I Love the kids too but using an analogy there where\nOkay you watch film you prepare for the game you practice all week you kind of script up what plays you think's going to work\nAnd normally it's going to be a balance of running past but let's say you're in a situation where you know you're more physical then that other team\nAnd you know you can run that ball and you come out and you're chunk of them I mean you're getting three five seven yards at a pop choking choking on okay we used to call we used to take the shoulders of garbage All right I like it and here's Nebraska football did that back at a time when Tom Osborne was there they had all those big ... up front they were tough to self defense\nBut here's what you see on TV and you see it all the time you go away from it\nYou got something that's working and for some unknown reason you either get greedy or fearful or you let your emotions getting away and now it backfires on your ... sticking with their plan\nAnd look at the NFL why why do they passed so much and sells raise those tickets Celtic as it gets people into the stadium to then go buy popcorn and soda beer and all those other things that go with it I mean Jim I mean what what do you do I mean like your coach in your players like what do you do with all those distractions I mean 'cause right now there's a lot of distractions\nWell here's what we used to talk to our players about pollen and you know which stadiums with allowed some in Nebraska stadium even regardless of their record is loud yeah Iowa the fans are right down on top of your I mean you can't even here when you're down on the sidelines so we talk about blocking the crowd noise out or taking the crowd out of the game\nAnd we do that by having a consistent game plan we try to get first downs not the big plays all the time stay out of third long situations so I think you are now size that with\nUh the stock market people they see a temper said dropped ... percent drop they want to make it all up overnight you can't do that you got to just make first down and make it up a little time\nOut while they also say people listen to crowd noise and that is people trying to sell them stuff or less they listen to a neighbor was like oh my gosh you see the market I got out\nWell shoot if Johnny or Sandy or whoever got out I should get out now and that wall for Haitians are yeah how do they get trained to make decisions are they a professional what training to actually go through\nI I tell people this all the time while investment advisors and financial advisors you know people pay them or they feel like they pay 'em to go up really your best ones\nYou're going to see their value when the markets go down\nOr they have you in downside protection vehicles do they help you from making emotional based decision again earlier this week I mean with this market jumping down and up and down and up I I get it people get scared they don't look at it all day they haven't been trained like all of us have here\nSo stopping people from pulling all their money out of the park at our market excuse me reassuring them that they've got the right game plan in place the ads what it that's really where you get the benefit of a professional\nAnd so here's how we do that at Paul you brought up a great story earlier this week about how you were a proactive way calling our households and just so they can hear our voice and you know which one's probably need it more than others and you brought up\nThe fact that you knew this one gentleman is a business owner and he's really tough to get a hold of during the day and you're calling this guy it's seven oh two AM and he'll off my phone calls at seven to eight and he he loved it and if it was his response he said I hadn't even been in the shower yet I've got my wealth advisor colony that's good stuff right there\nYeah well I mean but the reality is is we don't operate in an eight to five world anymore gym we don't I mean look at all of us I mean we're all on our devices\nI Would say twenty four seven but I don't I Do not have my\nPhone on my bedside table I don't I don't want to look at it I actually want to get good sleep because there's a huge mental I think a longevity benefit of getting good sleep we have talked about that before a show that maybe it could be\nUm and I just I don't wanna look at it and I mean I Know people are doing this this week there look on their phones in the middle night to see how the overseas markets were doing oh yeah\nI'm sure there is anything you could do it two thirty in the morning gym or not you've changed what was happening overseas in the markets are you going to get up and make a wholesale change to your investment plan for your clients\nSome people might uh logged in and thought about doing that you never know well\nThey need to be checked because as I'm telling you that is not safe I mean there's a reason why\nGood advisers know what they're doing and can help people\nThrough times like this and that's why they have downside protection they look at the tax ramifications and Jim I mean I have to share I mean there's a reason why we do have confidence and conviction and we do there's a reason why barons again here rated as as a top investment advisor in the country there's a reason why\nForbes and investment news and all of these places look at the Carson group because we show conviction

for you on this because I'm ... seem so eerie that so many times we get questions in his things that\nI just encountered in matter of fact last week when we were wrapping up taping a kitchen renovation I'm On a foreign up coming to today's home on a television show I had this ... situation where the laminate top came off and there were the two little wing bracket\nHanging out from the dishwasher and the homeowner said ah my dishwashers lose one what am I going to be able to do and say come on you're going to help it with this so I went and got the\nUm uh ... the two Marta boxy mixed up a nice little batch ... these two little um three quarter by three quarter rich pieces of wood\n... position that the dishwasher just right where it needed to be a pull the dishwasher out just a tad first and make sure the brackets for security well which I'm Glad I did because one of the whales had broken out one of them\nAnd then I put it back in\nA mixed up a good batch of the ... see\nCoated both of those things and that works well because of it had a ... a fair amount a flat surface on it so you had you know about a one inch by inch and a half flat surface that I could attached to the underside of that granted as you know the underside of the granted is is still fairly\nPorous such a way is perfect for attaching\nThis flat surface with the ... so I put the ... put it right in place put the little props in place [noise]\nShe thought I was a dang genius opposite gene so [laughter] but\nHow about you you just put granted in your kitchen that you've been renovated either I don't know seven years I guess in the years but [laughter] so how did you attach dishwashers when I first started doing that started making 'em depending on the age\nOf ... dishwasher which he doesn't say but you're right the way dishwasher typically attached to her um it comes to these metal tabs mounting tabs and there are the ... which has a hawk on one side and a whole on the other for putting a screw and there are a slump at the top of the dishwasher and you just hook him on and screw straight up well that's great but what if you have granted\nWell if you if this dishwasher is relatively new meaning ten years her ... younger ten years older or younger\nIf you slide that dishwasher out and look very closely on the sides of the dishwasher you'll see those same slots and that's exactly what it's for she just take those hook hook them into the slots\nTake a pair of needle nose pliers bend the hook out a little bit just to trap that cabin there than you push it back into place when you open up the dishwasher door you'll be able to drive a screw through that hole in that tap\nInto the edge of the cabinet and that will hold it in place and important to do that because if you're running the dishwasher is going to be moving around you don't want to come out and find it in the middle of your kitchen rights it's important it's important to do that so um that's all I Need to do and if you don't find those tabs you can try Denny's\nThe slots on this I didn't try the boxing but actually make a product just for that call granite grabbers or you can find them on

R. W. H. am Thirteen fifty and Cleveland, Georgia\nAnd hello to general manager dean dire thanks so much for putting us on the air there Cleveland, Georgia Dan is located in a beautiful part of the state about Ninety miles or so north of Atlanta and not too far from\nThe north Carolina border in fact it's known as the city of mon breezes them that's on the line with us because of its hilly bucolic location but is most famous for being the home town of\n... Xavier Roberts now you'd probably saying who is eighty Roberts\nAnd um although your daughter's might be more familiar with him because in Nineteen Seventy eight he created the cabbage patch dolls or Cleveland, Georgia as a lot of I think a lot of people that dislike that guy uh those adult scared me but I was yeah I mean I was I was an adult at that point but it was a huge success I mean they got bought by\nThree or four giant companies nice they sold millions and millions and those are\nGood for Xavier Robert C a really made something of himself there and ...\nYeah ... I Love the um\nI Love to hear about inventions and love to hear about how they come about\nIn the story behind it in our friend like my my friend Randy Schreiber it it it got her brushing him telling me the story about\nThat if you haven't heard the story of talk about go to ... go to go to brush dot com and listen to how this all came together for a man and when you hear other things I'm sure there's an interesting story behind the cabbage patch dolls and so forth and just the different things that catch on and how did they catch on in America how things\nAnd that was the timing right yeah I guess it's a charming and uh just I don't know just a\nYou'd never know when you appear on a particular show or you know something that just takes off but of course nowadays with the viral videos you never know what's gonna happen and when it's going to happen so anyway a pretty interesting how\nThat type of thing comes about I'll tell you what let's see if we can help a ruby is in Montana where the question really what can we help you with\nI don't want to drink after you ... when she you know like all the grass you're like\nOkay All right well that's a good question and yeah very common question and I'll tell you what I'm just a step back and make sure everybody understands what air ration is there's a lot of different ways to air richer yard but the best way is when you have a um it's a\nPretty aggressive like spikes that you roll across motorized that you can roller coaster is also a manual\nType that a roll across your yard and it just grabs plug dried out and throws them out so\nWon the world would you want to butcher up your yard like that well it does you know as the name implies that air rake the yard provides openings there so air can get in and kind of nurse you're the roots of your grass along and so forth it gives you an opportunity to also add amendments to the to the yard whether it's um\nA different types of fertilizer or top soil which a lot of times there's ... recommend it compost is also a recommended a sand sometimes is added that you add sand if you need\nTo kind of break up some of the play of course it's always good to go ahead and get a um a soil test before you do the ... so that you know what type of ... make the most sense now\nThere's ... you don't have to add anything because just breaking up the soil and making it easier for those roots to expand is going to do pretty well but Joe you're really on the plugs is laying around there you really don't have to do anything to\nKnow why do you really need to do is I mean if you don't like the way they look kind of wake them up and they usually have to start to ... break down and just sort of scattered 'cause they're just ... of course and it just got but you know where they can do anything to them and\nThey do make I should mention do make air raiders neither rented machines by the way you just go and rent when you wouldn't necessarily buy him a big machine like this like a narrator but they do make ones because I guess some people complained about the little plug that just punch holes are just like spikes that goes straight down and there are no plugs that sounds great but they don't work as well\nBecause you're pressing the soil when you're driving these spikes in the machine drives them and pulls out\nIn the soil and the roots don't absorb is much much better with the what our core air raiders cars are actually took down a core of dirt or a plug in dirt so but ... to answer a question you don't do anything about it just rake them around if you need to in the rain and will eventually just dissipate the spin melt right back into the soil\nAnd I'll tell you what when you when you rent one of the air writers they don't cost a lot of money\nUm but you can do an awful lot I Know a big big yard in an hour or so\nWe recommend this a lot of time share that experience with a neighbor or two and maybe you can call around and I bet if you talk to a few of your buddies in the neighborhood they'll go and I've been wanting to do that for years so you go pick it up you use it\nTake it over to the next guy he uses it take it over to the next guy he uses it and he returns it you split it three ways and you're talking about very inexpensive way to uh take care of this past that often is ignored but something that you should really try\nTo take
