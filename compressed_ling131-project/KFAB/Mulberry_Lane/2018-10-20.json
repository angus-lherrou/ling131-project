push\n... drama headlines drama Trump of course was here in the metro area earlier this week and the story for stories on the news was altercation between people outside\nThe mid America center or in Council Bluffs it wasn't about the story or the messaging and it was about selling viewership and clicks and things like this and that doesn't necessarily help in retirement because that's that's sucking the negative energy use and we also see is\nA positive things that go with it and by the way I I got to share the story so I'm reading this new book right now and it is super fascinating to me and it's called the power of moments and I'm In it they shared a story and so I I got to share this here with our listeners and with you so you're not prepared for this so this is good I always love doing this with you oh yeah\nSo Los Angeles California very popular place to take\nA family for vacation right or take anyone to go visit you know I'm of course you know how to use it or not it down yeah while traffic's on their story\nSo what's interesting is is if you think about\nComic hotels in the city of LA so you think about ballet or is one that comes to mind um the four seasons in Beverly Hills I'm you know there's red says all these places but actually if you go to trip advisor\nThe number one ranked hotel was I don't know if it still is but in this book it was at the time has written a couple of years ago was a place called the magic castle hotel I've ever heard of it\nNever heard of that sounds like it's on the Disney property as a first came to mind\nWell guess what it's not and so if you go look at it and I do that if you look at like the pictures of the hotel it's actually\nNot anything you'd look at it and say ooh that doesn't that doesn't look like the top rated hotel in a city that has more money and wealth than glamour and glitzy intense all and all about being seen than you would ever imagine\nBut you know what they figure it out at this hotel\nHow to make people feel good\nSo they don't have a big pool but they promote families but you know what they have this pool and I think is interesting and I share this with you Jim because I Know you've shared on the show your huge fan of Disney and the Disney properties and how they take care of yet experience and you know at this place has though\nThey have a little red hand phone there that you can go pick up and somebody underline answers it Hi this is the popsicle hotline [laughter]\nAnd you can order a popsicle comes out to you know gray for cherry or wherever flavor you want and somebody comes out and white gloves and a silver platter and delivers you a popsicle for free\nI liked that think about that experience and what you remember and you can go do you order other things and what do they do they come out to you for free\nBut now you're having a ... and you're less concerned that oh well my hotel rooms you know granite countertops aren't the best or the shower pressure is not the best or you know this pool isn't the nicest pool I've ever seen\nYou walk away from that experience of how cool is that I got to pick up this red phone call somebody brought me out a popsicle wearing white gloves and given it to me and by the way they knew who I was an answer those things and what what this book shares with you as moments matter in life\nSo was I think about you going into retirement they also about how are you building those moments\nThat extra trip with your grandkids and doesn't get out to be out of town where you spend money those moments you go to the park with them\nOr the moments you go tailgate is a husk or football game or whatever those things are and I love the concept of the popsicle hotline because it's how you make people feel\nAnd you know people are going to be living for a long time and so you got to make sure you've set the right time line for yourself and how you approach it because there are actually in this number is fascinating to be too if you can't tell we left his tax here [laughter] all of that I Do\nSo there are four hundred and fifty thousand people in the world today\nThat are a hundred or older four hundred and fifty thousand\n... yeah I imagine what that number is going to look like in twenty to Thirty years\nSo now think about if you retire five ... years sooner than expected by we actually see if somebody picks her retirement date\nWe actually see of sixty five sixty seven whatever the number is fifty um they actually ended up going two years earlier because of health or some other reason why so now if you retire earlier and you live longer I don't know about you but you better have are certainly a well done game plan in place otherwise you're risking disaster\nThat's true I agree with that I mean we just saw the other day we were doing a plan and the the people came in and they were chatting and we found out that the wife who's ten years' difference of the husband\nFelt like she was going to live to a hundred and we do you usually do the plan out the eighty five for the husband Ninety for the wife ... that's how it works out so we were able to quit and readjust those numbers and take her all the way to a hundred\nTo look at the look on her face of relief because she is flat out softball that she's going to make it to a hundred\nYeah and that's good though I mean I I'm I'm sure she will I she keeps doing things the right way I mean in gym that's one of the spectrum you know to make sure you're prepared the other is don't let\nLife catch you by surprise um assured you know unfortunately last week I went to a forty seven year olds funeral it's sad it I don't like doing those things obviously that you're just my prayers and thoughts with the family\nBut also helped again for me put my
