{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "I remember one time I I stayed in Nineteen sixty eight went to the rose bowl write a play USC OJ Simpson I was ten years old and I wanted to go to the game well that wasn't going to happen okay so long story short I went out with my paper out money and bought a GE color t._v. so we could watch the rose bowl parade\nAnd the football game on TV in color because we didn't have a color t._v. so it taught me the value of money right off the bat but also when you could do something for somebody else the warm and fuzzy feeling you get to that\nYeah I I just imagine how good you felt like how how how much your heart was warmed and all those things and um you know it's not always do that is easier to spend it and it's easier to wasted or blow it or whatever you want to do so I'm going to flip this went over to UC see so like what was the first thing that you remember about your mom and dad teaching you about money\nAnd then they always told me to save it because I Would always want to spend money on like toys and I was a kid candy candy and they always wanted me to save that for the future\nYeah so ice cream or whatever other fun things right hey there's nothing wrong with ice cream there's nothing wrong but why do you think they were so\nForceful are strong about wanting you to actually say that 'cause they thought that college is more important than ... yeah I mean that's a tough one college or toys you rank the priorities there\nBut also don't you wonder if they're trying to teach you about um life and that you're going to need something down the road so preparing for it and thinking about it\nUm You're Joking with me during the break here um that you were up soccer and then you share this great way you make money and I think a good thing for you to do but then you said your dad then takes it from you\nIs that what you said yeah OK takes is a wrong word your dad just transfers it to your bank account because what happens is this something sitting near piggy bank at home or in your wallet or your purse or wherever you hold your money\nI should think now with most kids on their cell phones somewhere on bend mower other apps is methane produced ranchers looking at it or ... or whatever else you have\nIs if you don't get it out of your account or you're spending bucket it just disappears it's amazing for me how many people's money disappears\nOn just stuff they can't even imagine like it's so they had twenty dollars and their wallet it's just gone they don't even know what they spend it on they went out to lunch one extra time er then I went to target or they went to ... or they did those things and I think when people remember and I won't forget this to Jim and you know when I went\nOn to college and that first time I saw how much money I had saved from my different jobs I was like wow and you know how good that felt to see that really good and also then when you're in your opportunity to see when you go from high school to college you have more control than you ever will in your life over your money\nYou got to make the smart decisions of you've got money saved you don't want to go blow it all on oh let's go buy a fancy new car or this or that because otherwise guess what\nYou got to work even harder for your money what happens there\nI remember Paul you know you go back to when we had those first jobs but then when I was in college I worked at a warehouse was it was a grocery store warehouse and I remember my favorite part of the night we'd work you know the minimum eight hours is the boss would come around and said do you want overtime and I knew that over time and time and a half\nAnd I was all over overtime always worked overtime never turned us down and then when you got that paycheck minuses extra taxes of course you got more money to put in your pocket and spent\nAnd it it goes a long way and I think she's the one of the things you and your friends and it was gonna realize as soon as you get your first pay checks and you see taxes taken out here where like this isn't fair\nRight I mean it it will be a big deal and what I'm trying to share with you and I hope our listeners understand is we don't think it's fair at any point in life but it's the reality is this is where we live this is our tax system and if there's techniques that are\nLegal and ethical and makes sense for our clients it's our job direct them and what they are in one of the biggest ones we see is not having the right estate planning a place and I what I mean by this is don't rely only on your will don't rely only on your power of attorney\nAgain I'll use cc as an example she's a sophomore in high school if something happened to our parents and by the way she had this conversation with her mom and dad is number one who takes care of your right I mean that's a question that we've told you and talk to you about and I think it's a great family conversation have actually by the way\nNot just because she's in high school and our parents are um you know here but I mean actually have this with\nParents and grandparents or if you're in your seventies I Would be having a conversation with your children who is your trusted contact if something happened to you your financial advisor should know who your trust to contact is so they know who to work with\nAnd they know who to help or who to contact and in case something happened but also making sure\nI think it's a huge fear of mine the sea and I made sure to protect us that if something whatever happened to me that\nI made sure there's enough money put away the life insurance and other techniques that you and your brothers and everybody else is well taken care of and people have to think about that because for many of us family is the most important thing we have and so making sure and I hope and I'm sure your personal finance class we'll talk a little bit about this\nIs helping people understand why we save money and we do this so we can have more time with their families and spend more time with her friends and do those types of things so we have to carve out time\nActually to learn about those things and actually get them done and that's why I called the parent tax why we make you transfer your money ... is I don't take the money I just transfer at the parents transfer so that way they are well\nIn their life and a lot of people you know Jim in your lap and get them or were you totally you felt so good that first time you saw you had five thousand dollars and you're out when you were younger because you made the right decisions and your parents taught you the right decisions and everyone needs a plan in place then I think\nFor all of our listeners today is you don't want to pay any more taxes than you ever\nHave to but you need to talk to professionals eighty four one nine eighty five Thirteen eighty four when nine eighty five Thirteen they want to thank Jim and I want to thank our special guest sees the for joining especially your incite your wisdom\nAnd your humor here with us as well so thanks for during the show thanks for having me yeah glad to

L. L. C. C. registered but at\nThe movie studios we got an you covered this is news radio we live in ... and ... and I heard\nNews alerts I'm Joe ... a deadly mass shooting at Pittsburgh's tree of life synagogue\nKissing is very bad inside there are ... there are multiple fatalities there or at least six centuries to include for police officers the police officers injuries at this time or not life threatening the other individuals are critical and serious nature\nPittsburgh public safety director window his Rick says authorities have a man in custody they believe is the shooter suspect identified as forty six year old Robert Bowers President Trump's traveling to Indianapolis where he's expected to comment on the shooting when he speaks with a future farmers of America annual convention\nA joint base Andrews before he left\nThe president also suggested that there would have been a different outcome had there been an armed guard at the synagogue Michael ... synagogues immediate past president told reporters people can typically enter the synagogue freely\nOn a day like today uh the the door is open a it's a religious service you could walk in and out ah only on the ah high holidays is there a a police presidents president at the entrance\nEisenberg on kitty kitty Pittsburgh the FBI is conducting the investigation which will be handled as a federal hate crime we're learning more about the man accused of constructing more than a dozen bombs mailing them to prominent Democrats fifty six year old says ourselves\nSay has a long criminal history here in South Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One he's been charged with criminal fraud selling steroids even making a bomb threat\nBoxers steep arrogant in Miami seal tracing five federal charges this is Fox News [noise]\nNow the news radio eleven and carry a baby whether watch\nBeautiful fall weather across Syria today mostly sunny skies temperatures into the mid sixties by midday topping between Seventy two Seventy five degrees this afternoon across the metro south westerly breeds between about ten and Fifteen miles an hour at times\nYou know we either noted we don't know if we don't know it\nWill try to find you to answer in fact any that's a great segue because you may recall a couple of weeks ago we had a call from Marie from Washington state uh-huh yes that's a really interesting question you might remember it was what's the difference between an eye on ... smoke detector in a photo electric smoke detector and if you want to know which one was better\nAnd I thought I knew the answer to that but it wasn't really sure so I did a little research\nI I Know I saw I saw the look on your face goes to you know a grand Joe and are looking at each other right now on a on a special guidelines so you know it's just like Joes right in the booth with me and when you're on that question came in I looked at him he looked at it short in\nMy show at ... I was I was up to date and say what do you say Oh hi Mary how's the weather I'm starting\nTo shrug your shoulders I Will do that very [laughter]\nI'm sure I'm sure listeners would love that um [noise] so so that was a perfect example we don't know the answer ... will get it for I didn't want to just say oh just pick one and see what happens start a fire and see if it weren't Jonah [laughter] so um but anyway I did a little research and I spoke with some experts and I made a really interesting discovery fit that I wanted to share a listener so Maria I hope you're listening\nFirst um the main difference between the two types that I Am ... smoke alarms and better at detecting flaming fires okay it's a once a month to burst into flames and photo electric smoke alarms are much more sensitive the smoldering fires that initially start with a lot of smoke\nSo so what should you do you want to protect your home and your family from fires are from ... from smoke and the answer is yes mhm\nRight exactly so virtually every recognize fire authority and we're talking about like the national fire protection association consumer product Safety Commission you well all those organizations recommend that you use both to protect your family both ...\nAnd in photo electric so does that mean you have to have to smoke detectors in every room run every level\nAnd I thought well that doesn't sound right and sure enough you don't need to because they do make dual type cartridge ... type filter so you have to look for the smoke alarm um that has both technologies are called dual sensors huh dual sensor alarm style I didn't realize that or how that missed my\nMy expert opinion on stuff but it missed me and I missed that completely and I was really glad I did a little research so when you go to replace your alarm's their smoke alarms looked for the dual censored type and that will detect both smoldering fires that's have smoke and the flame because it really is important to have both\nAre that sounds great sounds really good in a good good information good things for follow up that we would realize that that type of thing and the good thing too is they have lithium ion batteries right\nSo that's where a you know now days well you you know during this time of the year always talking about changing your battery but ah in this case you don't really have to because it lithium battery will last ten years but your your smoke detectors and your carbon monoxide detectors won't last\nUm you know ten years actually if they're ten years or older right now it's go ahead\nGo ahead and discard them start over with some brand new ones are good news is very inexpensive very ... you know it's it's very easy to be able to utilize that put him in your home and up especially when you started to fire up those furnaces far up the fireplace those kind of things are really really important from that standpoint\nAnd I think they recommend changing the batteries every time we got the clocks ahead her back and I think we're about to do that are away on like another week or so I think we fall back on ours that'd be a good time to check those batteries if you haven't\nYeah exactly ... good good little caution there and we have a lot of information coming up as we do each and every week we have some great callers we have Jeff on the line right now they do Jeff hang in there we're going to get right to your job when I got excited and talk to somebody I wake up to [laughter]\nSo we'll be able to to get right to your great question in just a little bit

out or maybe doing a little work out in the yard or maybe you're going for a nice healthy walk around the block that's always good or you might feed back in the old workshop tinkering a little bit of horror of building a little boy out of work or\nPut seen around or some of the other terms that we use when we just want to get back in a just a do a few things around the shop but whatever you're doing I'm Glad you're spending that time with us here on today's home on a radio we certainly appreciate that in\nA job when I Do our share of 'em do a little workshop work here every now and then that actually Joe's in the middle of a seven year kitchen renovation\nUm he told his wife it was only going to take three weeks in is this your seventh year Joe was that\nRice said next time you see ... the kitchen will be [laughter]\nIt was the last year so she's got five years ago man of it coming along it's coming along good good with the holidays are right around the corner or I Would imagine the intensity is going to pick up and I suspect we'll be out of this house with a holiday that he'll be visiting friends\nHey it's always great to talk with people all over the country job just go right back to the hotline or right now\nOkay we've got Paul on the line from Indiana Paul and see you have a question about us staying in your same tell us about\nOkay let's say a culture than saying okay and\nThe general great\nBut it's kind of great black white\nStaying at the bottom of the calls that I don't know why\nOr something but I Can't imagine anything you know why she might have a\nCall ... polish remover maybe or something like that would\nBe yes [noise] so any rate uh assume that it could be either polished out are saying they're down ... exactly how to go about doing that\nWell it tell you like a lot of us situations when you have things like that um you know some things will work and some things never will work and some things you just can't get rid of but it's worth trying a few things um you know a polish sheen um type of\nCompound like you polish on the outside of your car or something I've heard a lot of people use where you actually apply it and then a lot of times you'll use a wet sand paper like a four hundred or five hundred grits and paper\nYou know and just kind of you know just try it out a little bit just see how it reacts um that that can work there's different other materials that you can use but a lot of times uh Joe it's affected that color almost as bleaching aspect of it it it doesn't matter how much you polish or sand it sometimes those things just won't come out of there\nYeah Paul ... often we get calls about states in sync but they're usually dark Danes not white stand so [noise] um I I'm not sure what you do specifically for white staying but I didn't tell you a couple of options for just stand\nGeneral on culture marble um which is as you might know culture marble is manmade material that's just don't particles mix with residents and pigments may molded into what looks like marble and very durable and affordable and it's very popular you see it all over\n'em but when it does stand you could try cleaning it with a cloth soaked in either straight hundred and peroxide or a fifty fifty mix of white vinegar and warm water\nThan is lay the cloth to wet cloth over to staying let us up there for a while and then see if that uh than ... warm soapy water and see if that helps that doesn't work you might have to use a mild abrasive or dating I have recommended in the past a product called bar keepers friend would just like to comment\nBut it's much less than the ... at the very fine abrasive is not very uh not a really rough abrasive or a product called hope's perfect cleaner that works really well too and the problem with sending yeah you could probably send out any stain but\nCultural marble usually Paul has a like a high glossed finish and if you start sending you going to take the high glossed finish off\nAnd then you know that area's going to be dull and probably be pretty noticeable so I Would try cleaning it first with a with those ... with us products I recommended or with a you know white vinegar and warm water and ... peroxide and see if start there and then and see if that works\n[noise] okay I'll give it was a shock\nWe just we just Roach out a whole list of things you need to do better and better grabbed a wallet and occasionally go\nTo and I could quickly enough [laughter]\nWell glad we can help you Paul I'm sure one of these methods will will help and at least improve the
