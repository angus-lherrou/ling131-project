that he is a fiduciary\nOne they were putting a mark up on every single bomb they hand so one point eight percent they had a bond portfolio at five hundred thousand they've been doing that every

just don't do what's in someone's best interest to help them out so don't let these happened and they believe the barons and other you know wars receiver because we behave that way for people so let's

going to give you a number eighty five percent\nEighty five percent of your Social Security benefits could become taxable Heathrow in armed on top of that and actually CNBC I Know many ... so they calling this phrase I like it and I'm going to use it and I'll certainly credit them for it they called this the tax\nTorpedo Jim tax tornado torpedo yeah why because if you don't take action many years in advance to set up your income stream efficiently you're torpedo in yourself\nAnd the problem is is the strategy can really take more taxable income away from you so you have to structure

house or maybe just taking it easy either way we're certainly glad you're spending a little bit of your busy weekend with us here on today's\nHomeowner radio we've really had a great time so far and covered a lot of different subjects but one thing I really enjoy talking about is when you have a very good solution to common problems around the house and\nIf you're sitting there right now and you're thinking about really need to be plenty my gutters out before winter really set than well we've got some great information for you we talk a lot about voter brush and we talk about how effective it is to minimize the amount of work you have\nTo do and cleaning the gutters but we uh get a chance every now and then to bring in our buddy Randy Schreiber from gutter brush to talk a little bit about it hey Randy always great to have you on the show\nThanks for having me appreciate it\nHey I'll tell you what it was such great feedback when uh you know as I Love it when you talk to homeowners and you show them a particular thing and they will say that makes sense and I know you must get that type of feedback from all of your years in working with the gutter brush from homeowners across the country\nWe do it's it's a very very simple product in simple design that we we get that feedback quite a bit like well why didn't I think of that or something so simple you know ... ... you know solve a substantial problem for so many people that we've been very fortunate in terms of uh the feedback we've gotten into the testing and uh\nAnd results we've received from just a simple simple bottle brush the lines you're got her she got her system well\nExplain a little bit visually what it looks like of course you can go to go to brush dot com right now and see exactly what it looks like and see some really cool videos that Randy has on the site but just explain it to explain it like you normally do with homeowners and why work so well\nSure it's a sign of Russia if you get an vision it's almost just like a\nLike a large bottled brush her almost looks like a big\nCleaner where it's a it's a cylinder shape rush that come in three foot length and we have a few different diameter is to protect different shapes and sizes of gutters but\nBy far the most common it's just our brush that protects the standard five inch residential gutter and that Russia is become a three foot Langston Hughes slide them right into your channel and to end\nThey look they line and and feel your channel creating a barrier against leaves and debris but letting water flows through so basically you're just you're taking your a\nSimple brush filling your channel with it and\nMost leaves debris pass over the top of the brush it creates kind of a rounded\nRaised profile the top your gutter and leaves Passover and water is free to flip through the gutter so it really prevents leaves and debris from building up in there and and creating a clogging moving down to your doubts about where they can really uh your block your doubts about cars over flows and all the associated damage that occurs when you're when you're gutters aren't functioning\nRandy ... the thing that I like most about gutter brush is the installation process which is basically just shove it into the gutter right I mean there's no screws are mounting cabs are clips or you're just force it into the gutter and it's flexible enough that um if you have\nHanger that comes off the roof and ...\nThe top of the gutter meaning a I'm a hanger that holds the gutter and place you can slip to go to brush right underneath that without affecting how it works is that correct\nIt is yeah that's one of the one of the best of benefits that are vantage is I think we have over many other systems is just the simplicity for installation there's new tools require there's no fasteners um nothing is interfering or you're sliding under your shingle so you don't interfere with the roofing system at all and you and you're right the brush the brushes are\nThey slide right underneath are demanding brackets are spikes that typically hold the gutter to the fish were born in the home and so you're just sliding sections and to enter the gutter and you're right they're flexible enough that if you have a a corner fitting you can bend it around the corner and at the end the ...\nYeah so if you got any any dangles or angle pieces there's no need to cut or anything you can just spend a brush around the corner and even at the end of the gutter if\n[noise] if you like so they come and three primarily three foot sections and we also had a couple of half sections are Eighteen inch pieces in the boxes\nBut if you get to the end of the gutter and you've got a few inches too much brush you can just bend\nThe brush ... right back on top itself are kinda folded into itself to create a shower length and that really you know removes any need for cutting or tools involved\nOh in fact that that was the next question I was gonna do get to be in on they can you cut it I assume you can but you're saying don't even need to do that you just pulled over\nYou can yeah in some people have liked to cut it to the center core of the ... is a pretty heavy gauge galvanize steel wire so if you've got a set of bolt cutters or ... you could cut it if you want to but for most customers we just think it's it's it's a lot easier and more effective just to take that brush and kind of just bend it right back into itself the Brussels will kind of folding nest together and\nYou'll be kind of doubled up for a few inches there but that doesn't hurt anything and the whole thing tux right into the gutter so it's a really simple way to create a custom linked without any cutting\nWe're talking to Randy Schreiber of gutter brush here on today's home on a radio and uh it's a family business that's been in business for Fifteen Years Randy's father actually\nInvented the gutter brush and it's made right here in USA and
