choice about music I like that a lot of my friends is that for the last\nNight we felt the the big debate happened in Arizona you know this is one of the states where the Senate could be decided perhaps you know and and that's happening in a lot of places I mean I'm In Nebraska courses is looking at its own\nA hot race than to women running for the seat vacated by Jeff Flake or to women running in the race to to to try to hold onto and to try to gain the seat there in Nebraska cures didn't fit in Maryland right when\nIn Arizona last night yeah here since about the Democrat Martha McSally the Republican\nDebated last night tonight there'll be a debate here in Texas involving Beto O'Rourke the uh the challenger to Ted Cruz the incumbent Republican was holding on to or to hold onto his seat in the U.S Senate receiving these races up all over the country and and in so many of them it's a neck in neck fight in these debates could be\nThe determining factor Gary if you look at to what's going to happen in the midterms\nI'm trying to figure out Germany you're there in Texas was destroyed cruise strikes me is a state of Texas ultra conservative very smart guy I'm real file why is this so close\nThat to a great question is I think a lot of it maybe goes back to the last presidential election\nTed Cruz you don't have a solid chance there during the primaries to take the nomination all the way to the invention and in fact at the convention\nSort of fought tooth and nail against Donald Trump who became of course the\nThe the the nominee but uh you know it was and I think the beating that he took during that race from who the man who eventually become president has made him vulnerable in a way I'm Beto O'Rourke is a much younger guy and and uh has a lot of charisma and he's been playing that a piece in Congress now so he's had some experience in Washington\nAnd suddenly is a is a huge you see a lot of money pouring into this race record setting up some money\nAnd that may be a determining factor as well here\nIn Texas as red as it used to be still pretty red though I think\nIt is for evidence is read as any of the others across this part of the country and I I think after the November midterm uh you know that there are predictions that it could turn maybe a little purple that it could go blue all the way\nUm the ... you know they could say stay solar ready if cruise wins this thing I think that that would really a trench taxes for\nThe next couple of decades as a Republican state\nI don't know a O'Rourke except by you know what I read about him so he used his challenger is he going to be able to keep up with crews and a debate\n[noise] while they had to so far they and both of them of course declared victory there that always happens that happened last night in Arizona\nAnd it'll happen I'm sure after tonight's debate here in Texas and he he's held his own you know again he had some congressional experience and so he's familiar with the debate stage and with the running a statewide election as he's done\nSo if you eat meals its own cruise obviously is an attorney a former attorney the solicitor here in Texas and has his own experience in running a campaign a presidential campaign and now he's applying those same tactics here so yeah I think they both hold up very well and it makes for entertaining TV for awhile Gary\nNo doubt Jim thanks always good to have you with us Jim Ryan ABC Radio and Dallas a real clear politics average in that race this morning as grows up by ...\nI'm a high of a nine immigrant up a
