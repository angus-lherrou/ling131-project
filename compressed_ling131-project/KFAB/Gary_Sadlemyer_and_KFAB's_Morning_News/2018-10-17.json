{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "You know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be re injure reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still are surprised when you say that\nBut yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling [noise] ah so he did get coal credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right\nYou know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift [laughter] she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you'd never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like\nThat now the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of 'em yeah back then now nowadays a thirty minute she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in that in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction and fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was in the Willoughby or it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be as kind of a companion piece to its distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's\nEver [laughter] and then just so many good the what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and he started the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nFor the next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with Nicholas ... about some of the older type television programs check in with us next on
