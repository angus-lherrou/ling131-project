bigotry on line for months before the shooting according to reports Mr Bowers unleashed a tour of anti immigrant anti Jewish conspiracy theories on gab which was a social media network that have been embraced by a white nationalist I hadn't heard of it before I went there\nA Saturday morning after hearing the news of this it was disturbing to say the least the type of hatred that was their it's since been pulled down the company that was hosting the gap website uh told the company that got people that they would have to find another host to some place else\nIn the meantime this guy powers

his bio said that the Jews are the children of Satan he was criticizing refugee groups including one called the Hebrew Hebrew immigrant aid society are highest for short\nHe was saying that those

three times\nIn stable condition you going to be making it in court today on some level or hearing here we do know that the attorney general Jeff Sessions indicated on Saturday and we've seen that in that sense that there would be a death penalty charge as a possibility against him\nA that you're looking at the the lives of the eleven people the department of justice is filing hate crimes against uh against them with criminal charges that means that he could legitimately face up to twenty eight or so that penalty charges against him depending on how they late is out today\nI Wonder why sessions would even met again though I Would say oh it's a possibility I Would think it'd be a slam dunk\nYeah I think that's certainly seemed like it I mean they found him they shot him in their police were able to get him on that level and bring him in I Would think that there's really a no brainer in this situation I guess it's just sort of a determination as to what they win local officials want to do going forward\nSays are say are the fifty six year old accused pipe bomb or will make an initial appearance in court today it's not expected to last long probably just about
