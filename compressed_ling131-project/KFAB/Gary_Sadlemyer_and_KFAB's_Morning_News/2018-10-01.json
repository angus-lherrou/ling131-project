iPhone and and\nThis never happens but one day I don't know ones that are Thursday it's that I needed to sign him again is that a bad sign\nNot necessarily um what happened is about fifty million Facebook users were affected by this most recent bridge and then an additional forty million of us\nUm were logged out as well so they locked out about Ninety million of us I too had the same thing happened to me over the weekend never happens you know you got to go on you could have been one of those affected and you might not have been one of the Latino\nIf you were you know you would have gotten a probably a a a notice on top of your page that says you may have been the victim of a security breach now so if you didn't get that you probably were not one of them they just log you out as a ... an extra added security measure\nOkay that's probably what it was yeah I mean it was being in another country or something and some I don't know but I\nKnow but you know what they do is what they said is this this happened in in something called up view as feature raises you know how other people can see your Facebook profile\nAnd so if you were looking at that maybe are changing some things on there that's how the hackers slipped in there and they got a hold of the information somewhat information did they get a hold of well whatever would be on your profile page you know where you work\nUm you know your friends and family they don't think that they got a hold of your private messages\nThrough Facebook um they're they're they're not sure of that but they're saying there's a couple of things you can do to kind of protect yourself even further uh one of them is to do that two factor authentication change your password as they always say\nAnd then there's something called the device on it if you go to your settings and I'll tell you something one of the things that they make it very difficult for you to find is your security I mean you're setting baseball it's really hard to find out what if you go on there you go on to your home page at the top what you see your name home\nYou know a friend request you go all the way down there is little blue arrow\nGo down to that arrow and an almost to the bottom it'll say settings okra and under settings you can hit security and log on and that will be able to tell you where you're logged on in other places\nSo for instance mine says that I'm logged on to this computer\nThat I'm On now it's as active now and it says I was on another computer two hours ago um which was that a computer here in the newsroom\nI it'll give you can go down and see there's another one that's on my phone then I'm logged on on my phone and you can tell if somebody else has been on your account that you don't necessarily know you know while you're doing this and while we have another one of the thing is probably a good idea to go on to that security and log on page and just\nTake a look at it if it's everything you want you can change your password on that page you can do the two factor authentication on that page you can set up extra security on their um\nOne of the what am I I'm Down there now to share what one of the

deadline especially the higher priority of the background investigation higher level of the official\nIt's an even shorter a deadline and it's an even higher priority so this is something that the FBI to cut them to know of course the situation the the world is looking at what is happening here there have been hearing where everybody knows what these allegations are\nSo it is a it's a very

probably more important to contact them to interview them but at some point after they've interviewed all the people that have been mentioned in her allegation they would then go back\nTo Dr Ford and talk to her now tried to filling the gaps based on what the people that they had spoken to has said and now they go back to her and they're going to be I'm I'm sure they would be talking to a judge
