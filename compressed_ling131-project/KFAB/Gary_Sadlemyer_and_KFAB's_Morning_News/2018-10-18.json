other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for appearance who use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give it to this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank guinea private line of credit [noise]\nUh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera can keep up with their budgets um you know I was\nJust in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a\nFour year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad\nIs now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible\nThe colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really string students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\n[laughter] that's right you know and and it really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem\nIs really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be felt\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Ellen Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a

while I just want to do states including Nebraska one uh I guess confirmed case Aaron Douglas county a doctor up right the morning by the way to do\nGood morning Gary ... it's great to join you this morning so I'm as you mentioned in your preamble of this is a disease that's been around for a few years so we first saw it in two thousand and fourteen and a cluster of cases in Colorado and California\nAnd then it seems like it skipped a year and then we saw another look like a somewhat of an outbreak in two thousand and sixteen it\nSkipped two thousand and Seventeen essentially and now we're seeing another uptick a we have had two cases a in Nebraska that are suspected a one in Douglas County one out in western Nebraska I've not heard whether those are confirmed cases or\nNot okay how old are they certainly are very suspicious\nRight how worried should people be parents particularly I mean Syria's gonna miss me I guess\nI'm well it can be serious but I think that the first thing to emphasize it's a it's a very rare so a less than one and a million persons have a contract of this and the United states a sense we've started looking at it\nUm when it does hit it uh does obviously a generate a lot of concern because it's a polio like illness where I'm mostly kids are younger than four years of age\nDevelop fairly acute onset of paralysis of one or more of their limb move 'em and so you know that obviously is something that is very serious\nI'm In following some of these children from other areas of some of them appear to have long term you know long lasting paralysis others completely recover\nSo it's a a mysterious disease it has some aspects of being infectious in that there are some clusters of it seems to be seasonal um but we don't know what causes it and there is no effective treatment at\nThis starts out kind of like the flu from what I hear a so at what point would you say okay I Need to get to the doctor\nA well obviously if there's any kinds of fines of a limb week this er corral assist those would be the strong signals that one needs to seek medical attention\nI'm In the first outbreak in two thousand fourteen there did seem to be some linkage to what we call an ... virus of it did cause some respiratory tract disease\nIn subsequent clusters of these cases are there really haven't been able to pinpoint any any known cause\nWhat would be the treatment\nI'm really it's supportive care trying to\nGet these are mostly kids involved into physical therapy and uh you know rehab just as soon as possible trying to maintain\nThe function of those limbs again it appears that a sizable minority at least to go on to have a full or partial recovery of but there are also some that continue to have paralysis\nDo nothing to mess with yeah when I when I when I saw the word my life has been okay that's a that rings a bell\nYeah it is somewhat reminiscent of a polio that we saw um you know decades and decades ago\nYou know the things that your listeners want to uh to take home is that uh you know you want to try to prevent things that are sometimes can cause diseases sometimes have neurologic complications that we know about\nSo obviously a during the warmer months you want to prevent mosquito bites in West Nile virus which can also present with exactly this kind of a syndrome ... paralysis\nYou want to make sure that your kids are getting vaccinated appropriately for things like polio a which you know luckily we don't have anywhere near us we don't have any of that in this hemisphere but could come back if we're not careful\nAnd that is pretty universal isn't it about ... uh yes it is\nAnd um you know flu vaccine or as well as we come into the flu season or not a perfect vaccine but probably prevents about half of the cases of that sometimes can be complicated by various neurological syndromes\nUm and then you know avoid sick people take yourself out of circulation if you are sick so that you're

I don't get extremely excited when I see this because\nFrom a logistic standpoint the if he's going to have their hands full because if you establish minimum seats eyes will that be the same size for an aircraft\nThat holds fifty people that old three hundred and fifty people or will there be varying degrees of minimum side so there's a lot of things here that have to be addressed\nBut certainly we are taking a step in the right direction because airlines are never ever ever on their own going to get to the point where they try to see how big they can make the seats\nBecause of silver revenue to look they want to cram as many of us on there was\nOh no doubt or could they do one thing would it be possible to just eliminate the uh the seat tilt back because it for the number one if you use it you feel guilty number two if the guy in front of us is that your misery even more miserable\nOh yeah we're conscious I really like what do you know that I knew I did\nDo I do I mean I Know somebody behind me that doesn't have much room to begin with a nominal William ... I just\nThink yeah it is and believe me I'm completely with you and you know there's some airlines like spirit low cost carrier where none of their seats recline and uh so you really never an issue now they have very little room as it is\nBetween rose um and people understand that and people complain about it but look there their flights are full they're packed\nAnd as long as people are packing airplanes airlines have zero incentive to change the way they do things there's also the things that the airlines do not approve of and those are these the the protector of pins if you will\nWhere you basically can put a device small little pin on the seat in front of you that prevents them from\nReclining certainly I'm not telling you to go by the end they use those but you never know the person in front of you may think oh they're all those seats that don't require you know it probably is\nSo I remember you've you've told us and then I I don't doubt it for a minute there will look back on the news is a good old days an air travel but ... is a very might happen though that fails they look you need to you need to get a little more space to people\nThey'll do something they will but they're so far behind on like the drone issue and we saw drones coming for a decade back and\nNow they're thinking gee we need to start doing some things yeah you think it's just that there are reactionary organization that many times does what the airline industry tells them to do\nVersus the other way around is it supposed to be for the FAA to tell them if the airlines mess up from a maintenance standpoint and they're fined\nFor a million dollars\nAt the end of the day you're going to find out that it's negotiated down to maybe one million dollars with certain things in place to make sure doesn't happen again I mean ... how many of us get to negotiate with the government if any time that we're in fracking of on anything and\nUnfortunately we see a time and time again in the airline industry and I don't want to throw cold water on this because I think it's good for\nAn airline to have some sort of pressure as far as minimum seat sizes because\nI'm Jeff ... of any I impede dodge commercial real estate here is today's grow Omaha minute progress on April ... billion construction project more on that coming right up the grill I'm a minute on ... a B is brought you buy still can go\nOut and do you mean that are kind of heated patio near happy hour appetite new collection new craft down and now let's hear from still can go one hundred and fifty cents\nAnd is wrapping up on the city of ... billions field house located at Lincoln street and shy and Dr that's between eighty four than Ninety six streets\nWorkers have installed a state of the art artificial field it will be the first artificial turf in Nebraska to have new eco Phil made from recycled plastic as opposed to the regulated hires commonly found in field turf\nAnd there are short grow Omaha minute I'm Jeff ... in the dodge commercial real estate joined Trenton begging me every Saturday at nine o'clock or grow Omaha on news radio eleven ten KFC by always\nDo thank you Jeffrey on his time saver traveling now seven fifty four here's Lucy ...\nFrom the a one United heating Erin electrical name secret traffic center twenty fifth street now shut down in Bellevue at Lucile\nDry that puts it just north of corn ... and that is due to an accident in the area that cleaning up that area a hundred and forty eighth and center out to the west west bend you've been an accident there and on the north side west Ben Ames at fifty seventh an accident in that location that's look at your own jealousy Chapman\nJust report is sponsored by a narrow bread melted honestly you all go cheese on freshly baked one hundred percent clean bagel than sliced toasted uncovered with green trees sound good visit your local but never a bakery cafe for order online for rapid pick up a narrow food as it should be\nGet buzz ... son ... latest ...
