found and that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on us and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise]\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how how Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made that he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but\nAgain if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you really not going to find that you have to dig really deep and and find out what maybe some explores wrote about that they heard in

this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked him I die and actually spoke to one large hairy by pat he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with ... church latter day saint church and it's in there so\nTo say that these things happen happen ...\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky\nA large black wildlife mass landed in a field releasing a huge ear covered

listening actually bought a ... book on a about this but when I was going through it I I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep\nI like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fell over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this and uh\nHis book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big for topic it\nWas a stunner I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archive articles sixty eighty to

during a program working with our Hispanic community to celebrate Hispanic heritage month at the same time rehearsing for the opera which is the next week and doing a symphony rocks show all in the same seven days and that I think is is the gift\nThat I can bring to the numbers are quite staggering actually so when you think about the um Hudson's bay and\nIt's like it was just over a hundred and twenty thousand people every year and of course a number of those folks are in our concert hall but I Would say over thirty percent are now and we've got twenty five thousand other areas students to

going on it everyone even within Islam really aware of what's going on I don't think so um that's how smart operations like this Ron\nI'm a but the result is is that when you're a little deceptive to

claims he's building a political operation sport on the beach and President Trump\nCalled ah let's see me to impeach\nAnd Audrey welcome to news radio limited to be big mourning mourning thank you to be here I'm so he's just on fire with Trump patriot apparently oh what what is what is the ... what is he doing is uh just put up advertising and signing up people to do what\nThat's right he has he's as you said as a progressive liberal billionaire activists that is trying to\nReally use that that needs to impeach movement that I think in a way to mobilize voters to the polls that they've outlined nine reasons why they think Trump needs to be impeached as crazy as they are they're really baseless claims that\nThat are pretty hard to send a but but we'll have to see if they if they work and actually turn out voters I mean we have Democrats are like Joe Biden saying that there is no basis to introduce articles of impeachment for Donald Trump\nAnd the ... the has that same thing so\nReally that's that looks like a very extreme is\nA liberal activist groups that are using this to to see it that can be to their advantage and then that Trump\nNo um what do you suspect I mean this could ah here's the way it seems to me is the real uh the really a activist Trump haters are the people that are just on fire they're motivated to vote already\nUh what do you think you're right what do you think it'll do to uh to the to the Republican side of the ledger um just to see this kind of a movement attempting to oust the guy that they voted for will energize the right\nWell you know it should write because when we look at the process and realize that people were calling for Trump's impeachment before he even took the oath for office\nSo we know that that's a very\nPartisan movement and that shouldn't mobilized Republican and it should also mobile I undecided voters because in America we have a constitutional republic we have\nA system where our leaders are elected by our two cents and so people don't like that they should go to the polls and twenty twenty and they said they should vote for representative that that represent their values\nBut the fact that we can just call for peace met with someone that has different political beliefs than I is it something that should frightened\nEvery one of the American both sides of the I mean we have a legal system and profits in America and which we elect our leaders so this is really a frightening thing to see happening in our country today and it said mobilize\nRepublicans and conservatives to the polls and it said also really went over moderate wing voter at that that just an opposite them the habit America\nYou know I Wonder what um I guess every every especially when you're talking Russian all races every race really when it comes down to it as local\nUm those folks have to be ready to Democrats right because it depending on what kind of district there and they need to they need to either not mentioned as are soft pedal that right\nI think so and you know there was a poll in mid September that said fifty six percent of Americans did not want Congress to impeach President Trump and that was both Republican and Democrat so to your point\nOr why are we going to see what happens here I mean in in Texas they don't then calling for\nThis ah impeachment of Trump and we're going to that strategy work for him because it quite frankly it doesn't look like according to the full that worked for moderate swing voters and for even most Democrats and and Trump is not a reelection right like you said we've got races all the way down the ballot\nThat are very important and so we're going to see if it extremist strategy work but it's just remind everyone even listening to the program that we need to get out and vote and early voting I started in many states and and of course November sixes right around the corner but there is important races all the way down our ballot that need our vote\nNo
