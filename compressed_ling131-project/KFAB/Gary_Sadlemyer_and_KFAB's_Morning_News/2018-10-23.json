O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just released into the atmosphere and we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now in\nFifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed to Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been sponge to and it would outcasts and it with thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north\nOf Mel oceans will I bet well planet why\nThere is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\nBut yes the waters on Mars that's frozen at all\nKinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain and once you have that kind of planet with a thick C. O. two atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which\nAre only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breed them all\nBut if we're talking\nA hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country but the Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back a while we'll set of tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia [noise] the the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and ah because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone\nOr read email newsletter today it goes to goes to um done um\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHere's another you know we have here the c._e._o.\nFairly new CEO of the ...

F.\nA. V. got an email the other day I think are pretty much nailed it regarding\nThose enormous jak bottom mega millions of power mall [noise] ... billion or whatever\nIt is that the\n[noise] so we're not really ... we're not really buying a\nLottery second of all we're buying is a dream\nWere buying were buying just a little slice of a dream it's kind of fun to play along with\nHowever these things are one occasionally and one of the things that happens the bigger the jackpot Scott courses as you get office pools people putting their money together buying a bunch of tickets and that can be hazardous\nOr we are joined for a few minutes this morning by Spencer my ... group Asset Management Spencer good morning good to have you on\nThis morning glad to be that if\nYou're going to do this I get everybody together on the opposite there are some things there are some pitfalls right\nWell you know yeah let's do the math okay so what point\nSix billion a lump sum nine hundred million and then after tax five hundred million but we got ten people in our company and they just that says the company said hey you're\nYou over the office cool so I put it in a double share but we we still divided\nEvenly so I guess would get if we got ten of its that'd be fifty million each and\nYou could live on that Mary what's that you could live on that maybe for a while yeah I'm\nJust wondering how do you get how do you distribute the taxes ten ways right\nYeah so yeah so that's just a question\nHow does that work if if um if say ten people got together in an office and they go buy tickets or somebody else and one of the ticket sales then somebody has to go cash that an individual right\nExactly okay\nSo what would you would you what would you recommend that people draw something up by an advance\nA well with all the rules spelled out or what\nWhat else to strictly or or if you look at the math involved it's not something everybody needs\nTo worry about that yeah that was very ...\nIt's a ... you could you could handle it after the fact\nAsk the bag and billions lottery to ah to divided in our case in ways but for me it wasn't a choice it was just a group decision we're doing an office pool and you will to ten bucks stock within twenty is it just kept me equal share\nWill be a fifty million age but I I I have noticed there's a few more people taking days off here recently they might be a little too optimistic\nYeah no kidding yeah if you happen to win a by the way a number one double check the numbers are and then to triple check 'em before you call the Boston telling me to go take a hike cause that would be an awkward\nAll bad [laughter] if you ever go go\nGo go ransacked the office oughta oughta misread number right right\nBut seriously up for a second Spencer and you're right we know statistically certainly don't have to worry about it but there have been cases where\nA somebody has a claim they won and then and then the other people camp said no you were part of this office ball and there can even be litigation in some cases ah the payout has been delayed for years while it's in court what would you do to guard against that\nWell I think I think you get together and you have an attorney draft something on the part of every participant in the pool a mega millions to divided equally and give them your wire transfer instructions\nAnd anybody who's going to this level of planning before it's actually a confirmed are probably a little too optimistic\nAnd then get rid of the joy and enjoy life and the cameras [laughter] you know\nWe had a lottery winner\nUm that came to us as a quiet and it was it was sizable and we made him a lot of money but he's still spend it all it takes\nYears while while no even if it's a huge amount of money can it there's nothing to keep you from spending\nAt all or another look it up on the Cape and from being an idiot Spencer thank you read that he will make them a gallon here ah news radio
