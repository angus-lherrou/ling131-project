the next seven days in a row and it's just so easy you can just get a couple of handfuls of epsom salts baking soda and Dead Sea salts and take a hot bath\nFor seven days in a row and make sure that you pour water over your head three times in a row and before you go to sleep and in the morning set a timer close your eyes take five deep breaths and just repeat I\nAm the light of God I Am the love of God I Am the light of God I Am the love of God I Am the light of God and the love of God see just close your eyes set a timer ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes at night\nWhat is the salt water gruesome\nSalt water mixed with you know it's so amazing it's just that so many things but it really just clears the\nOur our energy or aura right everything that we have anything lodged and everything we picked up from others it can also clear our own negative thoughts and you know everyone has negative thoughts that are created on a daily basis\nSubconsciously so the salt water pretty much just clears it gives you a good clearing of the RS\nWhy those are ... more\n[noise] why does a curse work well good question a curse works [noise] ah because we allow it to work for a member of

happen\n[noise] it's the recipient that's uh that's very good question yes the recipients always recipient that let that happen and you know most nine times out of ten I'm it's because our our our was or not intact and I don't think I've met anyone with an in tact ara\nBut it's both and it can also be comic\nIt can be comic persist can be ... no it doesn't mean that you have to accept it because if you\nHave learned you know you you said God or if you're the gods where the U.S into masters or the angels and if you make it very clear that you no longer want this to be part of your experience you

all spirits you can get rid of them because you can\nHe's them as well so what happened in that case and that's a very good question Josh I'm Glad you asked her on there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nDown and what do you mean by black magicians oh All right well it's already known edition or I grabbed\nI Know sorry clarify suing them edition and it can actually send you an earth down there and what they do is they will go and I'm looking for spirit at the cemetery\nWho have crossed over and they will make the calls to Garret who are very disgruntled you know they either kill someone or they raped someone and then they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send us your tail and if that happens actually quite frequent\nAre they under the control of loose suffer Satan\nThe dark lord I absolutely\nThey are definitely in the dark lord exists\nBecause when you said somebody sends them that's who I think is sending them\nWell it depends because it's always
