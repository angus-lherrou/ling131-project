{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "From Pew Research that showed just in the last five and ten years that we used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that\nFar apart now they are extreme far apart there's\nThe far right\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off\nThe far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here in the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan you know the Republicans\nBelieved him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like I mean and and and who's got all the guns\nIn the world we do so so this is really the I think that the social unrest in this downturn is going to\nTop the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans going to say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff in the end the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare this more of the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded\nFrom the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time especially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be ... I think states like California or the whole west coast or\nThe whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet shop thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument in its argue mid hatred in the Internet or on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the salt and you know ... senators and in the elevator and stuff this every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell ya I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do

[laughter] and and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the ... the\nNext year also George's this is this is when it's gonna you know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her as well it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year\nAnniversary of the greatest stock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero hour\nAnd and are newsletters that Ninety

back last September ... won a fellow was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ... meter\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position we're coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like in may that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to apple loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look\nThis is a reversal this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand\nAnd twenty at the latest and that that's not good reviews or when I was just going to say\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so I Would peaking now or it holds on and noticed that we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble
