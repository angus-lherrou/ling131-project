Jonathan how do we explain this how do you explain this to people who are non believers in all of us who might say oh you just happens what do you say to them\nWell first I look at him for a while and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that but I often start with I happen to believe at this point that the past and the president and the future all exists and the infinite realm\nOur human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you were seeing everything that is how do you know that\nWould question the question\nAnd often that stop someone because one can take a book with a\nPattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it but the image is still there to your to your brain\nJohn do you believe in God\nI Believe in a higher power I Believe in a higher wisdom I Believe in a higher form of energy the I find that there's no other\nWhen they were you angry with that higher power when this happened\nYou know I wasn't and I\nReally had a hard time getting angry I found the most comfort in accepting if you will come my way and my hope is my sense is that this flow has a higher meaning that I don't have all the details but\nIf I go with it rather than fight it it makes my days\nWhat message would you have for somebody John who's going through the same thing you went through\n[noise] the message I Would say would be when it gets really really dark that's where you find something that's really really white\n[noise]\nAnd it sounds like you have devoted your lifestyle to this mission of getting the word out about what happened to Ralph the dangers of some of these medicines and of course what's on the other side don't stop All right\nI I don't intend to I Am I Am definitely devoted communicating what happened to him but at a higher humanistic level they're\nGeorge there are a lot of people that have a lot of pain and in their pain my message to people is there's a lot of white you just have to look for it\nWell John thanks for getting the best job John's book of course it's called the infant

which was the single biggest award than a civilian employer can win from\nThe department of defense for support of military men and women specifically I'm In the guard and reserve and their spouses so every year there's you know a few thousand companies nominated for this war and they only on her Fifteen and it's a lifetime achievement award so we can't win that again but we're excited to have it

have an idea I own idea what I think the motives are but what are you what do you think their motives are\nWell you know I think about it in a number recently whether it's a good censor a number of videos internally about you know Google and also by extension or they're either utopian they you know want to make money in one respect\nBut they have a world view that they want you to I'm an actor they want to build the world\nAnd the thing is is now they they're playing politics\nAnd if they have the power to change your ship ... perspective um one day and we think they very much what we think they have and we are doing it right now I'm In of course you can break it down to like oh the way or the you leaning\nOn but it but the fact that like how did they get the power of the things in this direction shift our opinions without us know\nAnd so that's really kind of are concerned that they could undermine democracy so no matter what it was the fact that they can do it at a huge

of Miami it as a huge package processing facility a and at least several of these packages\nAll through this facility so uh this has been a focus of the investigation over the last twenty four hours

family my my wife's a father a mat holes awful who was geez I think he was in his mid to late eighties for sure when he was living with us\nThat parish um they had a regular Bible studies people that were really growing in faith they would pick him up and take him to the Bible studies and bring them home and\nThey just loved on our family and loved on him and took care of him and I know that the

think it's in Corinthians where he says look if you cannot stay married and you can dedicate one hundred percent of your life to the church\nThat's best because then you are serving the lord that's your only priority that is the best thing in life if you can do that\nBut if you're if you have any tendency is to be tempted sexually you should not do that you should marry\nAnd and and may search and otherwise and make sure that you don't set yourself up to be drawn into sexual sin because your sexual desire and one's not better than the other per se in in the eyes of God but if you can dedicate your whole life to the lord and serve the lord and not have to fight that battle\nFine but to have a church make that the mandate across every body that is in leadership in an
