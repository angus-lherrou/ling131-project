conclusion with his FBI investigation and I'm a bone although Mitch McConnell yesterday the Senate leader was unequivocal is that we will vote this week what's your best estimate of what will happen\nWell he also said they were going to vote last week and what what we've seen between now and then it's really an an enormous concession Gary were a member of that Democratic senators have long been calling for an FBI pro but some time now that obviously like to go on for months and months and definitely that's the argument from the other side\nFor the for the Democrats part they say no we're not sticking to the latest test and it and we just want these allegations that at great for the FBI has been doing that\nI Would tell you though as of yesterday and overnight it seems to be the latest reporting indicates thing might have something back like today though\nCan you imagine that now that have been highly possible the FBI has incredibly talented individuals\nA lot of them they have the manpower and the woman power it will do the Asian and timely an expedition factor at that and that's what they've done between now I'm between friday and today remember the Anita Hill investigation only took three days\nThat report comes back let's say a comes back today and tomorrow\nIt'll get the senators an opportunity to decide is there anything in there it's going to change our vote and when I think that senator is an opportunity I Am talking about\nThree or four that might be swayed by these findings everyone else knew they were going to vote and that never change never changed before judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing even began\nSo is there going to be anything in what they have found out that is going to make a difference to them my prediction is no I think we're still going to be in the same position we're in today\nAs we were friday the allegations as compelling as they may be inconclusive and senators are going to have to decide whether that is the kind of quality of evidence they would want to use the ... nomination right\nAnd um her attorneys are saying they are the FBI isn't talked to her that this might weird\nNo I wouldn't think they would need to she testified last week I don't think anything now I got a copy of Gary had I been a special prosecutor ... doing the questioning that I Would have asked a ... a lot more questions of her lap prosecuted it just in terms of fact finding\nBut they probably wouldn't feel the need to re enter you ain't got it or given the amount of time she that testifying in front of the committee last week that's probably why they wouldn't want to interview judge Kavanaugh that want to use their time and effort their precious time in this case interviewing for corroboration purposes not re interviewing the main witness is\nAll right ... thanks oh\nThey was going to be with us attorney Wendy Patrick there yeah I guess then who is a woman or is it a second one\nCame forward the she was the one with the weather in tackling the face of the party be Deborah Ramirez says she says uh that she uh she has no indication of talk to any of the people who she said could maybe corroborate her story\nI thought she gave him twenty yeah here twenty people well you know that's all I'm\nLike almost all those are the new book that got all the\nResources they need to talk to anybody that need to go but you said we've done this a lot she probably they probably lifted elicits these are just your\nFriends that she wants us to talk to the delay this thing at least ... this is so transparent Gary now\nAnd there are so many inconsistencies and Dr Ford's stuff yeah there are all these other allegations against judge Kavanaugh now this is why the Democrats are moving away from you know the Ford case in the ... case and the sweat in that case they're saying well\nHe's just not fit to serve you got the wrong case he's gotten the wrong he's ... he we didn't get enough information during his White House years now they're going back to keep moving the goalpost though but I don't like what the president did last night look Mr President just shut the hell up\nWhen it comes to a doctor for don't be making fun of her in front of the older your ... would you do\nJust you know he gets all swept up in the moment when people are cheering for him\nAnd he starts going on a ripped\nAnd you've got two female senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski who are wobbly to begin with\nAnd when you make because they have an inclination to believe doctor for it but when you make fun of\nLike that that just pissed them off well I don't ... I Hope that there is no there I guess we're saying the same thing ... what is the upside there isn't one and the president exactly mocking there isn't that the weather is right or not he's fighting back I understand but what's the upside it gets a\nBunch of ... do you know and that means or anything\nBut the Senate vote come up anyway I hear yesterday\nOkay baby dot com over there for you by the way all of our cell phones are due to blow up at the same time today one\nTwenty yeah ah why is that Sheri Preston with that and just fourteen minutes a news\nRadio eleventh I'd go maybe sports right about now your German\nAlright center the wind isn't supposed to start blowing until today but something went through Nebraska football yesterday and swept day former exhaustively promoted recruits out of town Taj on Lindsey the receiver from Vegas left the team to ports yet known\nDot com the White House's hope both the Senate will vote on\nThe confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer told a very busy Chris Baker yesterday she backs the confirmation\nI go to court who called fat and come out it very important that we could opinion on something which of course the right to due process\nFisher says that includes the accuser Iowa where Republican U.S senator Joni Ernst is also supporting cabin on at this point a to stretch of the west ... trailer the military is officially open Eric Williams is the project manager for the ... river natural resources district\nHe says the three mile bike trail connects west Omaha to Belviq\nIs probably one of the most important connections in the area because of the interesting any underpass ... now has access to invest a continuing to follow the trail down into ... billion in Bellevue and all the way the Missouri River\nThe trail uses a pretty historic right away Granville Dodgers original route out of ...

A. which is the wireless emergency alert it is similar to the IAEA yes the emergency alert system\nThat radio and television stations put off periodically the E S tone will go off two minutes after this one but yeah when you're talking I'm a hard time talking to one Eighteen this afternoon everybody's phones all go off at the same time\nWhat do you know the standard for a successful test presumably will they be able to monitor it it works\nYeah it's a great question I mean I think they're going to know because you're not going to know who you know how many go off and and and and you know because if you have the exact number or something like that but yeah there are some phones is not going to work on like if you know people that still have a flip phone\nUm they will not be affected with that but you know the whole idea is that if they you know God Forbid something should happen and they would need to notify the entire country\nYou know a missile alert from another country maybe as who nominee or something like that they would be able to use this system to let us all know through our cell phones and so that's how the how most of us are communicating these days\nI got an interesting emails as a six year itch should be interesting today I was going to school\nI was thinking the same thing I was like all the teachers going oh this'll this'll be great that will be also right yeah I mean you know it happened when it happens when\nAmber alerts go off and when you know when you handle the weather system alerts that maybe go off and it just scares you to death but at least this one you know what it is and you know when it's expected so you can be you know looking\nFor it right you know what we're going to be seeing and hearing was somewhat\nIt'll it won't be like the bomb bomb bomb the earlier you know and the it'll be more like a feeling nothing\nOf them I'm not a very good job on cell phone person on the top presidential\nAlert and then it'll say this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed ever be able to get it you'll be able to click um dismissed and then you can just be on your way okay\nI Wonder when we're all call when it comes in what will it be if you're on a\nCall when it comes and uh I think I I if if you're using your phone at the time it's not going to interrupt your call but you'll still notice it's there I'm trying to figure out what that exactly means but yeah I mean you'll find out so maybe you maybe and I should call the afternoon it with the exactly one Eighteen we're on okay\nI'm emailing in my cellphone number okay you're thanks okay I was very very well the short Preston ABC Radio the deal is ah this could be I Love the idea I mean uh\nAnd we will ... eluded of is a couple of minutes after your cellphone alert you'll hear on ... a a like a U.S test which is a regular deal has been forever since basically they're beginning radio\nUm but I mean for you say for example there's an Amber Alert goes national you've got a notification uh if it was like on a national emergency that the state department or the White House dams were they were the ... you will need to know about a that's a way to find out and this was the first test of it I just didn't want you to be\nUpset or concern\nIf you're on a group and everybody's phone goes up at the same time as what's

George drove the born and raised here I'm\nKara Eastman got the the the prominent news we're talking about the second district Congress rates are ... members is the one term incumbent Don Bacon um the endorsement of former President Obama or the other day there was also some polling news right about that race\nYeah and it was kind of under reported to be honest with you about your times I'm late September just last week or so\nThey pulled the area and they've got done bacon ahead fifty one forty two which is known for a couple of reasons one\nSpeaking about fifty percent which is the the marker for an incumbent running if they're below fifty percent they're worried they get a buck fifty percent they start feeling pretty confident going into the election\nWas interesting to me is why I think this has gone this way because you have about two months ago it was considered to be almost neck and neck or by some polling or maybe even at very slightly in in a few obscure but\nWhat's happened in the past couple of months has been interesting in the national Republican Party has gone after these men and television commercials every weeks Labor Day\nAnd Internet and the Democrats\nTo DC they're in their fire into right now to October sixteenth which when I expect they're going to do the anti bacon ads but in that timeframe has been getting clobbered\nThe response from the national Democratic Party against bacon and I think that's probably what led to this gap whitening up in favor of gun begun the Democrats deciding that this race in their view is not that we're in a bowl or critical at the moment to them as our maybe thirty or forty other races around the country\nWhat do you think about turnouts in Nebraska and general a second district particular what what what would you estimate then I suppose uh some of them will depend on what happens with his cabinet deal right\nI think it does actually I think if Kavanaugh gets confirmed\nAnd appointed to the Supreme Court it may help Democrats on on the on the election day because they're going to be mad\nAnd anger may drive more Democrats are the polls vice versa if Kavanaugh doesn't get appointed to the court that may help Republican voters who are going to be mad and they may they may up their game on election day the other\nPoint of this is for is meant to pull this off because a couple of years ago now more like almost ten the second district for lack of a better word was gerrymandered adding Republican voters they brought 'em in from ... took out some democratic votes out of bills you put those into for various district\nAnd that made the area the district more Republican the only way Democrats get offset that is especially in the mid term election is to get those mid term voters who don't normally vote in the mid term to show up and it's been was able to do that in the primary is one reason why she was able to beat former congressman Brad Ashford she got\nPeople to the polls that don't normally vote in midterms to come out and vote for her if she can continue that trend and maybe up it\nThen she's got a shot a still even though the polls are showing or behind then she's got a shot but if those mid term voters don't show up then she's pretty much doomed\nYeah and then on the other thing that seems to me ... it was a and I think by the way we used ... campaign has been pretty good they've been pretty smart in the following way\nA special group in there that I think's capable of being a really special club and now we get to go find out and chased down the ultimate
