doesn't know what we are already in the works\nLooking at and doing now I have to take some time to say there's no doubt whatsoever\nThat many of the ten and the parks experience unsafe and an sanitary conditions at a disturbing scale and the action that we took it wasn't an ambush it was justified action by city government we had we had a warrant by a judge to go in there inspect those property\nAnd what we're doing now is is I and the city council we are we have met one just one and um we what we need to do is have a lot of rigorous deliberation on the broader steps that we need to take in Omaha we need to study\nApproaches and other communities what they have done and we need to develop a practical long term strategy for the city of Omaha and it did do and knee jerk and say we're going to have a landlord registration and every rental property in Omaha has to be registered\nIt it's not practical I'm going to give you an example opinion has such a a rent a landlord registration\nThey have about twenty five hundred rental properties we have modestly estimating Seventy five eighty thousand [noise] and it's just not a practical\nSolution to say that we will now hire enough housing inspectors how are we going to pay for it or is it going to require a tax increase to hire more housing inspectors are we going to charge the landlords this feat that come in and inspect them\nHow is that gonna work and then the other question that we really have to ask is how far should the city's regulatory powers be compared to the property rights and the landlords and and and we have to make sure that tenets\nUnderstand their rights to\n... so I think you know that we we will figure out a very good practical long term strategy for the city of Omaha it may be some sort of a registration and it may not\nBut to demand it from the state that is the wrong way to go another example I Want to give us Minneapolis 'cause we are now looking at what some other cities do and they have a department that does their inspections of about fifty five people and about forty five housing inspectors\nI mean this is in it their annual budget is about eight million dollars a year\nAnd you know if we're going to add something like that to the city of Omaha um it's either going to come at the sacrifice of another department or it's going to require a tax increase and that's

forecast recording the morning\nEvery morning how are you doing\nWell thanks for coming on here tell us what happened here uh we occasionally get these October freaks what happened with this one out of this come together\nYeah there is no question that it was a certainly are a rare event a yesterday um [noise] we were anticipating a snow\nFall a leading up to the man a it look like I'm prior to it and that we're going to receive anywhere from one to maybe three\nInches and as we're getting closer to the event yesterday we had a weather system tracking across the Nebraska Kansas border in associated with that was a little bit more unstable air\nUh in what we're trying to figure out what how quickly the cold there was going to a filter down through the area or in the wake of a strong cold front that went through um the recon last night and so as it turned out this this more unstable there uh which supports\nA stronger a updraft and and precipitation rate I guess would be the the best way to say at a overlapped with is the leading edge of air cold enough to support a snow\nAnd ah as it turned out we saw band of a moderate to some heavy snow occurring essentially along the IT court or from uh the Lincoln and all my higher is a west southwest toward your work and and points to the south\nThe last one that was a well ... was bigger than this one obviously in the Nineteen Ninety seven October twenty seven that was the last significant one like this that I can remember so it's pretty rare a Korean ... does this event yesterday tell you anything about what we can expect over the next few weeks and months\nThat's a great question and to be honest with you I'm not sure if that does or not a one thing I can say though is this upcoming week actually looks\nPretty not yeah we're\nYeah we're a forecasting dry conditions with high temperatures temperatures\nWill be in the forties today a little bit cooler because we're going to have to melt the snow on the ground but as we go through the remainder of the week it looks like high temperatures are actually going to be in the fifties to perhaps lower sixty two so uh it does look like we're going to return to more fall like whether this week\nYeah this is an El Nino year right\nYeah that is correct\nAnd what I've heard some uh whether experts say and I'm interested if you agree that this will be a likely I'm a colder winter we've already seen a October but then probably a milder winter you think so too\nAre that you know that's a good question it's hard to say I know in in El Nino winters you know if you're on the southern part of the United states typically they're\nA warmer in winter um in general it seems as though the ah the signal a across the northern tier is not quite as strong um as as what you what you see across the southern us\nAll right so you're not you're just in a blue sky and I like this this October force because we'd been robbed of October so far Corey where this needs to come to a
