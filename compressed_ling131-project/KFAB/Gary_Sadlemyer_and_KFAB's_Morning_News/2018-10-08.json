F. A. B. [laughter]\nHi Shaun he'll be with us on\nHalf hour to the Oscar buzz live from one news radio Lebanon may be good morning ... morning news Michael ... program NBC Radio national correspondent Michael the morning\nGood morning to you happy Monday Gary happy Monday why are we hearing the R word I mean ... the the the echo of Brett Kavanaugh swearing in was still in the room when we started\nHere and I got I'm Talking on which I think I technically it was actually happening the echo came in prior to him walking in that is true wearing Enron they really want him you had the petition to impeach Kavanaugh which has had over a hundred and twenty five thousand signatures progressive groups raising money to expel\nHim from the federal bench and the key Democrat lawmaker\nThing to investigate that edge to retake the house in November and I had some mainstream Democrats concern right now they don't want to look at this from that level they would rather just focus on the reflections but they're they're realizing I think\nPerhaps they're just figuring out wait a minute we don't have any real universal message right now that that we're looking at four and a child from the midterms other than not him and pointing either\nPresident Trump Brett Kavanaugh whoever happens to be in front of them when you're pointing to not him portion of it is their message meantime this really does seem to be unifying Republicans right now they're they're handling this is a watershed moment not just the swearing in of cat on not just the importance to that the President Trump has pointed out over the weekend but\nThey're actually saying that at this point the way that the Democrat Democrats have reacted in this entirety from the beginning of the Kavanaugh hearings with the interruptions and the outburst and people protesting all the way through to the end is going to be a big motivating factor for Republicans going to the midterm voting booths as well\nYeah I just keep it up and what about the dean of the Yale Law school is the up and say\nWell over the weekend I'm sure you can imagine that the the the sort of the parade of Kavanaugh accuser didn't stop and so you had a the former dean of the Yale Law school calling the cabinet confirmation an American tragedy he went on to say that this was in this was his description\nA black robe in body Mitt of raw partisan power inconsistent with any ideal of an impartial judiciary highlighting that Kavanaugh statements in front of the study this year committee\nOr highlighted him as a an artist and Ari part is in a hack if you will a that was going to be sitting on his bed and that's not a good thing so that's what he's trying to say going forward here in the meantime\nIt's kind of I guess adds some frustration level to all of this chief justice John Roberts is saying that he's received more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints in recent weeks against Kavanaugh\nAnd most of those centering on this statement the cabin I made during that Senate confirmation hearing so that seems to be what is at least for the fall of the time being having off through his reign of the Supreme Court justice\nSaid just going to try to turn him in a bad dream and and and then they ... some of them are on record Michael is in and want to make life miserable\n[laughter] yeah that's that seems to go on some level they\nFeel like a based upon the fact that he came out so so vehemently in defense of himself against you know he called a Clinton recalled other Democrats that that element of things as soon as he started to make mention of those names those people those individuals are going to start to make his life living hell while he sits on the Supreme Court\nBeautiful so uh they're doing they um don't a formal\nIntroduction noted the ceremonial swearing and that I write because the\nCeremonial swearing in tonight he'll be official swearing in on Saturday but you're going to have the the ceremonial one tonight and then\nThe Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh will take his seat on the highest court tomorrow a cases that he's going to hear will involve one or\nA involving a federal law that imposes lengthy prison sentences on firearms offenders another one asking the court to consider which illegal immigrants can be detained during deportation hearing just a couple of things on the docket that he's going to have going forward here\nAll right Michael thanks you gotta wait Michael bar in BC radio national correspond on your own\nNew impeach it's like when the impeachment for President Trump\nWhich if the if the Democrats like house in the midterms they'll they'll build start that process may ... over what they promised it I'm the only thing they can hang our hat on I think is that the language in the constitution is I don't know if it's intentionally vague but it's somewhat make high crimes and misdemeanors\nLight a parking ticket and you know ... that's a misdemeanor isn't it\nYeah traffic violation but does that mean high misdemeanors or just ... minutes to a crime is ... is is my ... we know when the crime is ...\nSo\nI guess they can say okay if you lost a court case ... are you a criminal I mean there's just for the number that cabinet\nWell his grandma ... insane and I hope they keep it up I don't really want it will take sixty seven senatorial
