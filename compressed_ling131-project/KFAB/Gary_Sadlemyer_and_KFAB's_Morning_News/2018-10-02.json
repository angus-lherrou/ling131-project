general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at say midnight in in the nation's capital\nHere or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because all\nBe on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always a rising and the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to feed and all the other plants like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own fine actually late on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars and um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but\nSome of Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this was what the old idea exactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness of pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nEverything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the look of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that it's free they taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's chart because it was a first\nBreath we're we're saying guess wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon the various plan if it's not that they're making things happen from outer space it's that whatever is born a person a president take an oath of office you buy a new car you\nGet a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that say about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers ... new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com and we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate you are you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know one on board months they in the area you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month staying here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things is a sunrise birth is is it near new and his son said is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same science but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts are moods even reincarnation and looking back at who may have been with the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of the life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing find which was signed rising the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nAnd uh and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah in this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay because I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was thirty what had happened twenty two when I got into the other is on the nuclear and an Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take

morning here I\nWas away last week so I'm not intimately familiar with this issue but I Do know there's a real\n... much there is apparently some dispute or exactly what your position proposed landlord registry Mentalist worst\nSure and there should not be any dispute whatsoever what I said I said at a press conference with all the media there including cafe be and I was asked the question by members of a oh talk one together\nOr um one together one community [noise]\nUm if I supported a some sort of a rant landlord registration after the uh it was the day that we have a code inspectors at Yale park apartments and what I said it's conceptually I support\nThe idea of a landlord registration what mayor wouldn't I mean are you know the primary responsibility\nOf government if the public health and safety of its citizens and I think he'll park apartments and demonstrated in an appalling fashion which some of our rental properties have have deteriorated to there's no doubt we\nHave others like that to what and that is exactly what I said as I support the concept\nI never said that our pie of asked are planning department to move forward with any kind of ordinance because I have not been gray made the statement that he has however as of yesterday morning no one has contacted are planning department or or law department to say start working on an ordinance\nSo what people like oh talking John traveling or saying in their press releases are not through the issue is the practicality of it and that is something we have been talking about since I was on city council other communities do have some sort of a registration\nThat rental properties are inspected every so often and then if there's violations they're re inspect it I mean what city wouldn't like to guarantee all the tenants\nThat the rental properties meet all code however the practicality of it is the issue for example la vista has some sort of an ordinance and they have about twenty five hundred rental properties in Omaha we have over Seventy five thousand\nRental properties so to have enough code inspectors to go out and inspect all of those\nWould be virtually impossible I never said we are modeling an ordinance after Minneapolis either we've looked to see what Minneapolis has done and what they have done they have that basically a whole department that does this and they have over fifty coat inspectors\nWhere you know we have a round of our building inspectors are I mean our housing inspectors we have around ten\nAnd so the practicality of doing this and their budget in Minneapolis is around eight million dollars a year you know to add another eight million to our budget in Eighteen or Nineteen 'cause Nineteen has done would be very difficult we'd have to have severe cuts somewhere else\nMust do your marriage surprise me that there isn't some kind of procedure employers\nAre much absolutely unbelievable\nAnd we have to proceed with caution I think there's a need for action I think there is no doubt whatsoever that\nThe tenets at Yale park experience unsafe and an sanitary conditions on a disturbing scale you know we have found over twenty five hundred are tally of code violations and Thirteen buildings and many of these were level one and two which are dangerous they're electrical firing gas leaks\nThese things are are things that we should not be dealing with and these are very powerful facts that these actually exist in the\nCity of Omaha but we really need are is that I Need to think in the city council needs to think and I'm attending a meeting at eleven today with the council we need to think through how far\nThis responsibility of the city would go to our to cause all of these landlords to to have to register um because you have to consider the property rights of the land thank you and we should also\nHave to consider what needs to be done to ensure the tenants understand their rights and that they have information on how to make complaints to the city if necessary and I think that the chances are good for progress however I think that we need to proceed very responsibly\nOkay just quickly just by email ... generally
