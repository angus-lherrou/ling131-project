D rightly say wait a minute you're kneeling against the anthem you're saying everybody who would otherwise stand for or everybody who's represented by that anthem deserves your\nProtest\nAgainst them

side we've only warmed it to the low fifties no temperatures are actually going to climb as we head into the evening and by tomorrow morning we could actually be close to sixty\nEven though he's never directed before they they told them Hollywood told him you got to direct TV first district a couple of episodes of something direct a commercial just to get your feet wet just so just so you don't embarrass yourself\nHe declined stating that there wouldn't be any stakes in a TV commercial or or an episode of some shell out there he needed the stakes to make it feel real to him so he went right in dove into the deep end oh hey I just kind of got that from the the song the the shallow song in the movie well a lot of what went into the movie Cooper has been ...\nBeing on it for four years now he's spent six months training with Willie Nelson son on lowering his voice and entire octave for the part\nHe became a professionally trained pianist and guitar player he didn't want to just get on set and mimic the movements these actually playing all the music in the movie is performed live it's not pre recorded in sync up with the movie afterwards and the music\nIs incredible I saw this Thursday night and ... even today I was still finding myself occasionally humming a few ... from the movie\nIf you haven't seen any other versions allow me to sum up the the story real quick no spoilers I promise I notice is kind of movie that people of eventually scene maybe not right away Bradley Cooper who is sober and realized place Jackson, Maine a legendary rocker a bit past his prime he's got a drinking problem many other problems but he loves performing one night\nHe sees alley singing in a drag bar and it it's love at first sight he helps or what they're singing career and her star eventually surpasses his that's the structure but I Will tell you going in the plot in this movie\nIt's secondary it's very simple it's a very predictable story\nBut a star is born still blows you away all avoiding common movie tropes about alcoholism and fame and all that stuff to directing it is phenomenal I was sitting there unable to believe that this was the first time director of the camera shots are beautiful there purposeful there's a meaning to every shot in the movie\nThere's just no way a newbie directed this but\nBradley Cooper has been studying the art of directing ever since his first TV gig on the set of alias in two thousand and one and uh he's been raped waiting for this exact moment that movie breeds\nIt takes a long time but it isn't slow it's over two hours long I think it's about two Fifteen if I remember right but it's it's intentionally paste it lets unless you catch your breath after a big moment and allows things\nTo develop properly as many questions as we have about Bradley Cooper singing in this movie we have the same questions about Lady Gaga acting ability granted she didn't win a Golden Globe for American horror story in twenty sixteen but you know not every TV actor can make the jump to the big screen you need the right role and\nAnd to no one's amazement she can play a ... a burgeoning musician\nWho is packaged by executives who hamper her artistic merit gee I Wonder where she found the inspiration for that character um [laughter] but besides that lady Gaga is amazing in this she's vulnerable she's beautiful and her performance as powerful I lost count of the number of times she gave me goose bumps on screen\nA star is born makes you believe these are two people who truly love each other I never saw Bradley Cooper on screen I never saw a Lady Gaga they get lost in their roles and transform into alley in Jackson, Maine Jackson, Maine I'm calling it now he is destined to become an all time great movie character you're going to remember him and twenty thirty forty years or so\nThe movie is dominated by the two leads but the supporting cast when given the chance they really do shine Sam Eliot as an actor when we that we just don't appreciate enough okay we need to sing Sam alley its praises okay he plays Cooper's brothers slash manager he's the one fighting the uphill battle of trying to help his brother\nAndrew dice clay yes that Andrew dice clay plays Eli ... father a guy who is a limo driver but he might also be mobster I don't know watch the movie\nIn that had space and tell me what you think that he's also poster boy for the I never caught any breaks in my life ... movement is one of those guys that I could have made it I could have made it but I just didn't Dave Chappelle continues the movie's odd supporting casting choices that somehow work as Cooper his best friend and a couple pivotal scenes a star is born\nIt as a rallying cry for anyone who ever wanted to make something out of themselves what you say and how you say it\nAre the two most important things that an artist has no matter if they're singing or talking on the radio and you shouldn't compromise them for anyone uh we have a saying in this building and all all kind of pulled the curtain back and let you look behind it\nGuys with ties ruin shows it's a phrase we say a lot in the building it means that executives in suits who don't have a creative bone in their body will train change what got you noticed in the first place\nThey don't care if they're wrong they'll just get another creative person and try it again but it's up to you as the performer to stand up for yourself and not let commerce given the way of art a star is born\nIt is a great movie but how great as it ever your reviewer\nSays that this is the de facto best picture winter one reviewer I Believe from variety said\nThis could sweep the five biggest categories on Oscar night a feat that has not been equaled since ... most of the lambs in Nineteen Ninety two I don't think it'll do that\nBut here's what I'm gonna go out on a limb\nAnd say that a star is born will do\nI think right now having seen no other candidates so I'm real comfortable in this production of a star is born is gonna win best picture best actor best actress and best song I've got going homeless for Oscars\nRight now that's that's a good night for a Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper I think they would each get too I'm not sure if Bradley Cooper produced this but he did almost literally everything else so I think he would walk away with two Oscars at the end of the night\nI'm neither Bradley Cooper or Lady Gaga has accepted an Academy Award before so it would be a great moment for them it is officially Oscar season and the Sears first major entry has set the bar extremely high on a scale of see it stream it or skip it\nI'm obviously going to say see it Russia and see it as quick as you can if you like almost famous across the universe or a dream girls you might like a star is born I'm going to go four and a half out of five stars for a star is born\nIt is phenomenal it's old school cool with a new age twist I Know it sounds cliche but I'm going to say it any way they don't really make movies like this anymore and they pulled it off\nTo the shock of every one I think PS guys if you think you're getting dragged to something by your girlfriend or wife\nThere is a bit of nudity and a cool dog so calm down you will get through it I promise I'm we will be back in a looks like four minutes with our first official friend of the show Julia Prescott she's got a new book on The Simpsons and we'll talk about it next on the shots and show news radio eleven ten cafe beat this is\nJosh on the show and I\nJosh that
