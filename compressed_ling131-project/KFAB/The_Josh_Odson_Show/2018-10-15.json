snow has moved out of the metro but some scattered snow shower still possible through early evening temperatures will be dropping into the twenties tonight so we could see some re freezing on area roads so use caution later tonight some ... ice is possible\nI'll admit it's very different but I think I liked it not every one well I I haven't seen it really done like that and it was a meat it looked meat on the big screen like that\nFrom what I saw Neil Armstrong was a man haunted by the grim specter of death that it followed him and it never deterred him though he pressed on and and that's a very American ideal you keep on working despite everything happening around you\nThere's a job to do Neal was willing to sacrifice everything to get Americans to the moon first it does address\nThe space race with the Russians there's a scene where the American scientist at NASA are enraged that they've been beaten in those early steps ... with a with Sputnik are getting the upper hand time and time again\nIt handles the conversation going on in American households at the time asking if the quest to land on the moon was worth it from a financial taxpayer standpoint\nHaving not lived in that time period I can easily say\nI don't understand why people think space exploration is a waste of money all all the tech that it gives you all the things we learn about\nHow the world works in you know even far beyond the world were really totally worth it in my eyes it's not even a question to me this movie makes very clear that the men in the Gemini Apollo programs knew the risks and felt it was worth it now\nAs for the big controversy surrounding first man\nThe American flag in a world where you have to denounce things you didn't think you had to denounce there's a flipside to that point you\nHave to say you agree with things you didn't necessarily think you have to say you agreed with well\nThe accusations being made that this movie is anti patriotic anti American were very clearly made by people who hadn't really seen the movie 'cause there's definitely a lot of American flags in this movie even one on the moon okay\nThat's another one of those images you see through the reflection on Armstrong's visor no they didn't dumbing down for you and do the standard plant the flag in the soil scene from a third person perspective\nBut it's twenty Eighteen you're going to believe whatever you want to believe and I won't be able to change your mind God Forbid we did our own research instead of take everything we read from a you know the Internet but back to the movies actual merits director Damien ... has made us expect big things at this point in his career twenty four teams whiplash\nIs a movie or going to look back on his being robbed a best picture\nA couple of years ago la la land it's gonna forever be remembered as the movie that won best picture\nUntil it didn't win best picture so your natural instinct is to say that this movie will be nominated for best picture\nI think it'd be right there are things that somebody gets a lot of nominations but it might come away empty handed on Oscar night might when if you technical awards but nothing that ah you know it's going to stand out as being a big win for first man that could take all the few Golden Globes\nBecause I won't have a star is born to contend with on the drama side she was those films they're all about sacrifice what are you willing to sacrifice to achieve greatness and first man is the story of a man who was willing to sacrifice anything and everything to solve the problem of landing on the moon no price was to hefty\nRyan Gosling gives a stoic focused performance Neil Armstrong didn't have a ton of personality or charisma as far as this movie is concerned\nHe speaks very little there's no hero speech made for the movie it feels very real to life how how people actually react to things happening around them clear foie plays Armstrong his wife Janet she gets a few monologue says her marriage to Neal deteriorates due to\nThe focus nature he's trying to get something done he hasn't he doesn't have time to take care of things at home and it's kind of an understandable problem she she could come out of this winning some awards and wasn't shocked me people like her she's a successful TV actress already on the crown with which is on Netflix\nAgain going in first man not at all concerned about the human element of space travel it is much more focused on the science if you're prepared for that I think you'll like it a little more that's a good thing to know what you're getting into before you sit down in the theater I think there's four things\nEvery little boy dreams of it at some point in his life one of those being the career path that he ultimately ends up taking\nThe others being you know as a child you dream of being a baseball player you dream of being a firefighter\nAnd your dream of being an astronaut I think that's just one of those things every kid\nKind of dreams of growing up first man\nIs a it's a wonderful film for every little kid who spent hours imagining what it would be like to go into outer space on a scale of us see streaming her skip it I Am going to go see it especially if you're a science nerd out there and I I use the term nerd as a positive thing okay it's not an insult I'm a nerd too\nIf you like the Apollo Thirteen the right stuff if you like a Nineteen sixty seven count down you might enjoy first men as well I'm going to go for out of five stars for first man a lot of people are going to find that long and dry\nI didn't I'm secretly wondering if there's a longer cut of this movie somewhere actually but a really cool practical effects they built a like real rockets and stuff and it's it's neat to see\nOn the big screen so far out of five stars for first man again can't stress enough because it's the world we live and nowadays there is an American flag on the moon in this movie stars and stripes on the moon it's there\nCalmed down snowflakes ah on my blog cafe be\nDot com yes I have my own page up there I enlisted the help of Nebraska's old astronaut Clinton Anderson we each rank

four on news radio eleven ten campaign made the jump shots and show would transition away from the front page away from the entertainment section on to the sports section full football rundown coming your way in about Fifteen minutes\nFor right now we focus on boxing Omaha\nA with a worldwide showcase last night on ESPN our own parents bud Crawford with a twelfth around the kale will host a benefit is fun to say about the way one man who was there in person actually got more camera time than Warren Buffet it's Tony boom from Omaha rolled Harold Toni welcome to the judge shots and show\nA chief know about that or should we take that conversation to at some point how did how did I get more airtime than he did I I don't know he clearly\nClearly didn't go buy a who could pay the most exactly Louis now let's start with the most important thing this is your second appearance on the show that makes you an official friend of the show can you take us through what's your feeling right now\nI'm I guess a little more calm than last time because the last time which additives also after Crawford fight now is in the middle of the Denver Airport now I'm at home and Omaha and still have power so all's well and and now they're on like last time a day off\n[laughter] well all the buildup I read for ESPN and other you know national sites kind of made the sun like more of a tuna for bud didn't think he'd get twelve rounds that've been of leaders were you surprised at when as long as it did\nUm I was but only because um I thought that all they get them off\nThe that kind of transpired a over the last few months and more importantly over the last week\nUm would lead to the fireworks so we kind of thought the end of the fight happening earlier in the fight I thought maybe\nFifth sixth seventh round that those two would stand Toto and trade and eventually Crawford land something big\nAnd as they seem to parents dropping throughout his career when it gets got in trouble is one of the best finishers in the sport and we saw that again last night in the final minutes of the fight 'em that one to fight Crawford that need to knock down and he certainly didn't need the dock out but\nUm I think it kind of shows that there's something really special about him that he was willing to uh you know kind of put everything on the line and go out there trying to get out of there even though we already had the fight well on hand at that point\nSo the the stuff we saw leading up to the fight that was released to to like each other rights I wasn't so some tickets or get a few more eyeballs on the fight\nNow and that is the case with some uh fights that you do have the animosity or the hostility ahead of time it does seem more kind of staged or at least it's just bravado boiling over in this case yeah they absolutely didn't like each other and it\nGoes all the way back to earlier this year a benefit as a felt like Crawford team and passed over a chance to fight him when they were both back at the hundred and forty pounds but sort of been in\nOver the last two years now they're both at one forty seven and a Crawford happen to be at a fight or benefit as was going to fight in Corpus Christi in February\nAnd the way benefit gets helped me the story out Las Vegas this summer is that he got off the scale the it's like you're already got a happy dude I'm On the day that you why because you just cut all this weight and he's like I get off of there and ... right there like Crawford is just there as a bike or he's not even involved are whatsoever\nAnd better leader said something to them then about ducking them and the two almost came to blows at that point Crawford told them if they wanted to they could take it outside\nAnd a kind of starting there than the fact that that would be just as long proper under Carter Vegas that all kinds of led to the match up being made and\nYou know ... Jose with an undefeated fighter us the number one ranked die by the WMBA are certainly a war given titles shot just the sense that you had a long amateur background Q.\nUm signed the top rank of the young age it was an easy fight to make because they've all had the same promoters um yes people love seeing property and against another champion but\nMaybe that's what the throw a white guy even though it was a big underdog I think people really didn't know what he had at that level and um although Crawford I felt like it was wanting to fight ... convincingly last night I don't think that anything that that is to make if they could have some some kind of bomb I think he's the guy that's\nGoing to be there in the water weight division of uh probably at some point to get another title shot even if it doesn't come against Crawford\nI was ... he could take a punch\nAbsolutely top guy\nYeah uh you know he bug dot the knock out in the twelfth and final round but like as you said he was winning almost everybody scorecard just about ... when did you kind of know that despite was in the back ... without a lucky punch more or less\nWell I'm In most Crawford fight what we can just\nDina and last night didn't play out any differently over the first couple of rounds you kind of takes his opponent to the okay this is what this guy's bringing to the table that nice\nAnd these are the things I Need to do to make the adjustments and you know kind of counter what he's doing to how things go my way I felt like an round three last night Crawford was already starting to take control now around for I thought was the only round of the fight that if I was wearing it I Would have given the benefit as it was the only part\nOr are the only round rather on two of the three judges score cards the benefit is one there were some other rounds that were given to him early in the fight by one judge but not to the forces probably the only round you could say that he actually won so I think at that point you're like okay we might be in for a little bit of a fight here for a while but by round five\nCrawford to turn the thing completely back around and from then on it was just kind of a downhill slide it the rounds got more and more and more decisive\nTo where um you got to the point to you thought you know probably around eight and nine that you know benefit has really needs to do something here like score a knock down or you know have some kind of fight changing power punch 'em ... who's going to be a landslide in ... in ... uh two Crawford's credit and that could have been to his demise that it worked out differently he was\nStill willing to over the last three rounds go toe to toe with this guy and um again as we were talking earlier I thought that might happen earlier in the fight with the fact that he was willing to do that or one that was already a decided on the ...\nI think says a lot for profit in the competitive nature he's a guy and I wrote this actually in my fight stories that was in the world health this morning um\nHe might be the best boxer on the planet but he is still a fighter heart and soul when and if you just stepped up and went to challenge him in the wider rounds you know bud really stepped up his game and and turned it up a notch himself and [noise] you know what I mentioned led to a sensational knock out that everybody was talking about all day today\nOr Tony ... world Harold with us please read his articles on Omaha dot com they're greeted by a paper read them to email is buses telling you love them because he was actually really great at this a woman but seeing the you after the fight the didn't make your article\nUm well a lot of it actually will make a the the column that's going to be in tomorrow's paper I've actually already shared it on Twitter but I'm a lot of it was some of the breakdown about how that punch 'em that that he landed that ended up being the decisive on the upper cut the knock them down and put them in trouble\nUm was something he'd been looking for a fight and I thought it was a a very cool a cropper to tell us how he was patient with that he knew that that punch was going to be there at some point\nAnd how we had to kind of wait until his time and tell them so no not yet a and tell us about the opportunity came up in that last round and actually even in the last minute\nBut before he landed that thing so we talked a lot about that um he also was talking to myself and and you know a couple of other of the the national guys as well just about his future and and the more things are going forward\nI'm into one of the other things he said was that he did his best to not let everything that happened over this past week even though he took a swing it but if he does have to weigh in on friday\nTo cities like I did not want that to take me out of my game plan at all and I thought to his credit he he didn't at all he looks like the same bug Crawford in there that had been in there with guys who hadn't gotten under his skin before I felt like everything that happened last week was a bad idea by the benefit is clan although I I get why fighters tried to do that\nBut I'm them being a little bit different than everybody else I think they really thought they had the better fighter until last night and Crawford is you've done all the all the time and he's been pushing shown himself to be in another class\nAnd I I always have to ask this question when we're talking about proper what's next for but\nWell I think that there's a you know a couple of things out there I'm first and foremost we we talk to to bother 'em ah who's the hall of fame promoter who had both Crawford amenity to us", "show_name": "The Josh Odson Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day":
