not move on to another candidate\nSo essentially if you can manufacture enough questions than those questions supplant\nRules of evidence as the normal measure to indicate someone's likely innocent or guilty\nThat's the formula that you don't like somebody generate a whole bunch of questions and that way\nCan subsequently say well we've got entirely too many questions surrounding this guy so we should move on to somebody else by that measure you could ensure that your party never have to accept or live with\nAnother nominee it doesn't like ever again all you need to do is simply generate a whole bunch of questions so that you can subsequently then say well because all these questions surrounding the guy we can't move forward this is all born out of that same proclivity of saying hey you know what\nWe should actually now judge people no longer on a preponderance of evidence but rather a preponderance of accusation now of course by that gage were all screwed well you know what I'm going to tell the militant left watch your ass 'cause around the country we're getting fed up with you\nAnd people are standing up against you\nWord for word Fisk for fist knife knife and bullet for bullet\nAnd if you're going to take this acrimony to a point that actually borders on violence in the streets [noise] let me remind you of something there's three hundred million in guns in this country trust me the vast majority of them are not owned by the left\nAnd I want to shift gears a little bit take a look at the NFL or some intriguing things they're happening or assisting in the opening in analyzing sticking around we appreciate it Matt Sylvan managing editor of him or the culture at the media Research Center has been a writer reporter and editor for more with more than Fifteen Years experience met we previous to appreciate sticking around thanks again\nDon't thanks for having me\nA Trump recently claimed after he put that NAFTA deal together that the hey he fixed the NFL TV ad deal with Canada it's just a couple of minutes [laughter] now do you ever see him taking care of the controversies surrounding the kneeling during the anthem in as much time you said\nOh that would be nice but it's not going to happen uh in fact the less he says about it the better because it is starting to duck\nDown a little bit [laughter] um but here's the thing it's it's coming back ah it's boomer hanging on the left age not hurting I guess the individual uh football players who are protesting except for um\n... if you believe is suit against the NFL that there was got Lucian but um people are sick\nOf being preached to of having politics thrown in their face when they sit down to watch uh entertainment show a sporting event um we did a survey recently with McLaughlin and associates I'm\nSeventy four percent of people say that when they watch sports or entertainment they're trying to get away from politics\nThey don't want to be bombarded with political messages forty three percent of those people are less likely to watch a live sport\nSporting event or like in a ... award show because they fear that it will go political as soon as they tune it in\nUm and this is we're seeing is the second time we've done this and it it it bears out um\nWhat what has been driving what has been driving me nuts is that folks think\nThat oh you can't get into your up their First Amendment right to freedom of expression on the field\nIt's none of their platform they had the first amendment right to their own venue their own platform but that's the NFL's platform and they work for the NFL so whatever the NFL wants to express this to be expressed by the NFL players\nRight their prerogative now having said that looks like not much is really being done but I think the reason why a lot of folks were so upset with the kneeling\nIs because they were sensibly in agreement with the new lawyers as it relates to wanting to wipe out racism however when you take a knee during the anthem that's embrace by America as a whole you wind up painting with a broad brush the name of racist across the entire country\nSimply by disrespecting the anthem that so many embrace\nAnd it looks as if it was a ham handed way up punishing the very very many for the actions of the very very few and the very very many who took on average I think took umbrage rightly say wait a minute you're kneeling against the anthem you're saying everybody\nWho would otherwise stand for or everybody who's represented by that anthem deserves your\nProtest against them\nAnd it didn't look very targeted that's why I took offense and I'm a vet are and I think all that to whoever pledged allegiance to this country and did so by putting their their John Hancock of John Hancock on a piece of paper and binding themselves do it naturally take umbrage at this your sense of it\nI think that's absolutely right look ... each of them is judgment of the audience for one thing I mean who who goes to football games who watches football games it's Americans middle Americans mostly meat and potatoes people who you know\nDon't disrespect the flag who believe in the flag who respects veterans um this what's this was one of the most\nIll conceived protests I think of all time because they completely misjudged what the American people care about and what they're willing to uh ... what they're they're willing to let go\nA in this for the sake of the first amendment which doesn't even come into play here [noise]\nNo I mean that's that's just functional illiterates [noise] I mean it's like a syndicated talk host we have a First Amendment rights they would with every one of the show but it's being carried by station [noise] and that station that has the first amendment right to determine what's going to be expressed [noise]\nI don't really get their ...

underneath me\nIt's one of the best of might not be the best but it's one of the best movie theme songs of all time the forty the anniversary\nOf the John Carpenter classic is next week the twenty ... if I'm not mistaken is the exact date or the newest movie in the series came out this weekend made a killing pun intended at the box office this weekend were dissecting it all tonight on the jump shots and show I was um [noise]\nI was lucky enough to be joined by Eric marsh earlier this week he\nTeaches film at DePaul University in Chicago specifically the films of Halloween director John Carpenter and I asked him what the legacy of the original movie is\nThe legacy of Halloween is is bad but uh not only of course says it produced a never ending creative sequels uh but it's one of the great I think\nA sort of her romantic independent film tales of of American history was a film that was made for very little\nA very little money that is very little time and it was a film that\nEnded up catching on like wildfire and not only you making a bunch of money but uh was also a beloved by fans critics alike and I think the the legacy really speaks for itself after all these years people still watch it\nAnd for for me a little background on me a Halloween is my favorite movie of all time it's not I don't think it's the best movie of all time favorite movie of all time there's a there's a distinction there if you think about it up for me look this film\nIt does the absolute best job of any movie ever of letting ... mood at the entire time how does how does it go about doing that whether a consciously or subconsciously\n[noise] sure I think and I think nude a is a great way to describe a lot of the John carpenter's films especially his horse films but I think\nUh one of the thing is is scores or it could poses his own music to his work and I think his sense of rhythm with cutting camera movement\nHe really just has a masterful control of all those elements [noise] um and he's a big movie buff and I know a Halloween he was distinctly you know self consciously ripping on\nA lot of the classic a horror film of the classic Hollywood period as well as its stock so he was\nWell studied well learned he and he loved the movie and I think he brings back a sensibility\nAnd there are there's quite a few Hitchcock references in this movie rental those off for us [noise] oh yeah there's\nQuite a bit ah not just in you know the style of the film itself um but uh in the character names or Hitchcock references there Hitchcock references are really throughout and I think the idea of voyeurism\nAnd the idea of using the camera as the surrogate sort of perspective a has a lot to do with it and a lot to do with the sec the success of the film not just\nPutting the audience in the eyes of of Michael or the shape as a they called him a but again that sort of tension that suspense I Know they had a joke or when they made the film when a Jamie Lee Curtis walks across the street towards the end they called it the\nThe longest walk in Hollywood history as a joke because they thought it was\nSomewhat boring but it really draws out the tension in a in a very Hitchcock way\nWe're talking with Eric ... teaches film and to poll University in Chicago how did Halloween become the horror movie that redefined the genre\nGreat question I think the biggest thing in the landscape of Nineteen seventies horror films seventies we're a great time for American or The Exorcist Texas Chainsaw massacre uh these films were very big hits\nAnd I think one thing that sets Halloween apart is\nAre the sort of rendering of evil in you know in body by Michael Meyers as\nThis unknowable on quantifiable and to see a you know there are horror films there's usually a source of evil and that is vanquished but I think one of the really unsettling things about Halloween is that\nIt's all unsettled and that was a very kind of knew or or sort of different way to approach or the concept of evil that I think really unsettled a lot of people\nAnd and I I think that might be the answer to this question in slasher films like a friday the thirteenth nightmare on elm street you end up rooting for the killer more or less now why in Halloween do I root for Lori strode and not Michael Meyers\nI think a lot of bad has to do with I think I should mention here is Deborah Hill who was John carpenter's co writer and co producer out in the film she I think what what's so special about the movie is how she specifically imbued those those high school girls with\nA sense of believability they're funny they're goofy\nA and you don't want to see their fate or you know go to the way that it does and I think uh they're how yeah the just the way we can relate to them as audience members ah I think is a much stronger connection than some of the slasher is that followed\nIf you're just joining us first of all where have you been you're late second of all we're talking with Eric marsh from DePaul University in Chicago he is an expert on all things John Carpenter and the movie Halloween\nHi my name is Becky I've never had more than three months of sobriety I was killing myself I was at that for fun\nAnd the road where I just didn't know which way to turn and teen challenge has totally changed my laser\nNarrow needed vehicle and do go to to see them id dot org

F. A. B. on I hire radio [noise]\n\nEight thirty three and all news radio eleventh and camping need the Josh shots and show the time has come\nForty years later is a man with a knife stocking baby sitters still scary Jamie Lee Curtis were prizes or iconic screen queen role in the sequel to Halloween [noise]\nGosh go to the movies [noise] um [noise] like really a lot\nBasically they're all the time [noise] I guess we should let them talk about it about time for another installment of producer Josh review the movie\n[noise] [noise]\nOh that's hiding all the preparation for nothing [noise]\nAttempt priority of family ... family if the way I raised her mother\nAnd she hates me [noise]\nAnd that she has her parents\nAnd the horse in this world than [noise]\nHave I might call and get over it\nTo call the new Halloween movie unexpected it'd be an understatement Michael Meyers has not been in the new movie in nearly ten years Halloween had been re booted re imagined and done to death flashers aren't really the sure thing at the box office that they once were\nIt's too simple it's not believable they're scarier things in our society now times have changed plus\nThe timeline of events in this series of becomes so convoluted and warped that no one could make heads or tails of it at this point some sequels follow this this and this timeline but leave out movies X Y and Z others follow the complete opposite it ... it would be too hard to explain to viewers what had happened\nAnd what was important leading up to a new film enter David Gordon Green and Danny McBride who are those names you ask well\nThey're the ones behind HBO's east bound and down and the stoner comedy pineapple express yes that pineapple express\nThey had an idea strip the plot down to nearly nothing pretend every other sequel never happened to go back to square one what would happen if Michael Meyers and Laurie Strode met up again great idea\nBut she'd made a lot of blessings before getting that off the ground well the stars aligned original director John Carpenter gave the project is blessing even offering to create a new score with his son it was just a chance for the two of them to make some music together which is his first love\nSo why not Jamie Lee Curtis agreed to play Laurie Strode again the character she played in the first Halloween movie okay\nSo you got an idea you got some people in it you're making a sequel to a horror movie forty years after the original even after all of that that you've gotten accomplished you're not going to pull this off right\nI Am happy to report to you today that yes my friends\nThey pulled it off the twenty eighth team version of Halloween is the best sequel in the series it took me\nA few days to be able to admit that but it surpasses Halloween too in Halloween H ... as the best sequel\nTo Halloween there's a saying in broadcasting and I'm sure it it's a hundred and a lot of other workplaces kiss keep it simple stupid it's an acronym keep it simple stupid that theory flourishes here don't don't complicate this movie the plot it's as simple\nAs the original Michael Meyers has escaped\nAnd he's hunting down Laurie Strode killing a bunch of people on the way the timeline is simple none of the other Halloween movies ever happened everyone involved with this movie\nTook such great care and making it that you can tell this isn't a cash grab like so many other horror sequel is on the surface Halloween yes it's a slasher movie big man with a mask kills them terrorists is a town but\nIf you did a little deeper you can see this is a movie about what happens after trauma Jamie Lee Curtis plays a woman who went through hell forty years ago and Michael still haunts her to this day eventually\nAh Jamie Lee Curtis this character refuses to live in fear she needs to end this she will either kill Michael once and for all or die trying either outcome ends the nightmare of the last four decades from her so many horror movies focus on violence none of them ever focused on what happens after the violence\nThis movie does Jamie Lee Curtis is a total bass in this movie she is a marksman her house has every security feature known to man\nShe will never be the victim again we see her\nTrying to men relationships with their daughter and granddaughter like in the clip you heard before I started renting here on the radio\nWe see her living in the woods off the grid it's a very logical progression forty years after the events of the original Halloween it makes sense she has pie TST she replays that night over and over and over again she's in therapy\nThis isn't a movie built on Gore and murder it's a movie built on coping through the unsinkable as a family bringing in directors and writers from pineapple express some old movies\nAnd that's a nice element of comic relief to the film when someone isn't dying there's enough humor to keep the movie entertaining something a lot of the other horror sequels\nDidn't do a good job incorporating there are big old massages to the original Halloween\nAnd tiny ones that only diehard nerds like me will pick up on if you love the original you'll notice quite a few of them if you've never seen a Halloween movie in your life I don't think you'd be lost by any means because you've seen so many copycats of Halloween you get what's happening on screen\nThis was a movie made with love for the original it shows it isn't lost on me\nIt cares about its characters you can see it wants to protect the legacy of the series\nI Love that in the last month or so which I've seen so many articles so many interviews so many fans lining up to digest this new Halloween it's made me so happy with the original being my favorite movie ever\nThere was such a long time where the most popular horror movie villains we're Freddie Krueger Jason ... who might be Scott's brother I don't know I've never seen them both in the same place at the same time and now\nMichael Meyers is king again I Love that the interest in the series has never been higher it's an important movie for so many reasons and it's been brought back to life the thing I Love most about Halloween forty years ago\nThat it was led by strong women in the new version shows three women all of different generations refusing to be a victim they're not damsel in distress they can handle their business there is no man rushing into save these three\nAnd it's really cool to see that especially in a horror movie the movie builds to a final showdown that ends\nOn a very satisfying no I'm not going to spoil the ending for you come on you gotta see for yourself based on the opening box office I think in the next Eighteen months two years you'll see more Michael Meyers at the multiplex one way or another I for one I'm willing to watch the saga play out\nUntil the end of time on a scale of see it stream it or skip it\nAlways tricky with horror movies and sequels you don't want to recommend things to a wide audience knowing the horrors kind of a mixed genre you know if you're in or out for this movie at this point all I'll say is that it's worth it if you're a fan of horror movies definitely definitely see it\nIf you like the original Halloween if you like any other sequels if you like any John Carpenter movie ever made you might enjoy the new Halloween I'm going to give it for out of five stars that makes it the best Halloween sequel\nEver and remember if you're a huge horror Halloween fan that's typical sentenced to say whore or Halloween than\nA tons of
