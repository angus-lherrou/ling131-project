believes the scammers are taking advantage of the weekend power outage\nBecause that costs money and we would much rather use that money for things that can help us Stay elected officials and help our political careers All right uh what I found interesting is I read the story\nThe victim's father was not even allowed to make an impact statement in fact I he he made a statement after the sentence was handed down after the judge had gambled this court session closed\nAnd for those that don't understand what an impact statement is in in in most cases in rational thinking parts of the world\nMostly America everybody else sucks where the best um the victim's family\nIs allowed to make a statement to the jury into the judge to talk about the person who's been wrong in this case an individual who was killed by a drunk driver and they get to talk about that person and they get to talk about the impact on their lives of losing that person\nAnd I don't think it's any secret that when you lose a loved one obviously it's an enormous impact on your life it's heartbreaking it's crushing especially when it's a parent\nWho's talking about their kid and anyone is a parent you know that you expect your kids to live long after you're gone\nSo to have to bury your own child I Can't even imagine how that affects individual and so in in my humble opinion I'm not a slinky judge I'm not a lawyer on just a guy on the radio but\nI think it's ridiculous that a parent is not allowed to make an impact statement before a sentence is passed on and when you read the story\nFrom the Omaha world Harold is says the judge had him had imposed both sides agreed upon sentence so what you had here at least I'm speculating but I'd be more than happy to put money on it\nThat both the prosecution the defense had a discussion and they thought All right how how much is going to cost to go to trial how much is going to cost to do this how much is going to cost to do that and I thought All right well let's just say the state of bunch of money and let's just come to an agreement on a sentence\nAnd they did and then they went through the dog and pony show motions of actually deal and out what some people might call justice so I don't think it is justice\nAnd I understand that the driver of the car as a student un oh and this was his first offense and all those other things but it doesn't take away from the fact that he was a drunk driver and he hit\nAnd killed another guy who by the way it happened to have had some drinks himself in fact he had had some drinks himself and he and his friend realized we don't need to be driving so let's take a cab\nAnd they did\nSo injustice once I got out of a cab to cross Pacific street he gets hit by a drunk driver\nSo\nDoes the guy deserve more than fourteen months in jail I think so but again I'm not part of the system I'm sure there are other mitigating circumstances I'm not aware of here but to deny the father is a family members and impact statement so that they can ... so that they can talk about their loss\nAnd maybe when they talk about the last and in fact the judge even told the father's father literally had to stand up and says gives me a I thought I Would be able to give a victim impact statements\n\nAnd let me read to you from the Omaha world Harold article judge James Gleason\nLooked it's once and then it prosecutors than back that's once Gleason said he wanted to hear Swanson statement but cautioned the fifty seven year old father\nThe sentence won't change for Esteban ... forte\nEsteban excuse me\nThe twenty year old twenty eight year old defendant twenty eight still going to you in a huh okay\nI'm I'm Sorry that just sounds like a yeah\nYeah okay sure whatever will listen to you but I mean it's not going to make any difference I mean to me it just comes up like a screw you\nAnd maybe that's me\nMaybe I'm just reading too much into this but you know when when you when you constantly look at the cycles of life when you when you watch the ins and outs the good the bad and you see things like this just makes me just me myself no one else it just makes me wonder\nWhen it comes to the ruling class\nDo any of us really mattered to our kids really matter or are we just all expendable\nBut I'll give you another example of this nonsense to cost you four hundred thousand dollars this

get a better helicopter I'm not saying that when we have is bad but you know what they're maybe get a new one\nOr on a refurbished one but what these type of policies in my opinion are designed to do is to get the police to stop chasing bad guys\nAnd if you talk to bad guys are and there are communities where police are not even allowed to chase them and if you talk to bad guys they'll tell you off I Know that they can't chase me I'm going to run and I mean think about it if you know the police can't chase you let's just say you're an average everyday dude or do that\nOr says whatever\nAnd you're driving down the road and you're speeding and then the police officer gets behind you and says hey you're speeding you need to pull over and you think to yourself well he can't chase me so you punch it\nNow I Know that there are people who were going to say well Chris if you have the license number or you could you could just go to their house later an arrest them won't want not necessarily because you don't know who's driving\nYou know you could use the old hey man or alone my car out to some guy one guy I don't know it was just a guy\nAnd then you're not going to be able to prove that in a court of law I'm no lawyer but I Do understand how you approve stuff and a quarter law so I'm a big supporter of police chase policies I Want policemen chase bad guys and I want bad guys when they run I Want them to be severely punished complete with a little tune up\nI'm obviously a little tune up is against the law and it would just be a nice in a dream world but in reality you can't really do that but how about at\nTwo years on to their sentence whatever their sentence may be just because they just because they ran wild and that would mean Chris we'd have to put more people in jail and that would be really expensive and our jails are overcrowded and the ... and the convicts aren't scared of being in jail because they don't lose their good time and they'll just beat up\nMore guards or ... should I say prison officers so the question is should we or\nShould we end police chases because here's four hundred thousand bucks I don't know what the city has paid out since the

and\nCrime is out of control Mary ... out of control and aren't you glad you're not this guy got it let's go to Cleveland, Ohio okay I was in Cleveland, Ohio for the Republican convention right very exciting at a nice time there in Cleveland did not get to go to the rock and Roll Hall of fame\nOh yeah and I was a drag on her to go but I didn't get to go but still had a wonderful time in Cleveland is a\nIt's a different kind of place I Will say that are at a gentleman in Cleveland, Ohio an elderly gentleman sixty eight years old had continuous problems\nWith burglars burger going through his back\nDoor don't even show the guy said All right fine if nobody's going to stop these people I'm going to stop these people so he booby trap the back door with a shotgun\nVery similar to a Wylie coyote plan is what it sounds like to me I this is if you see this in a lotta movies you know they'll take a shotgun they prop it up they they run a string\nTo it from the door open the door opens up boom it pulls the trigger and then what\nYou got is a well you got a guy shot up well problem here is if you're going to set a booby trap like that you might want to remember it\nBecause according to deputies demand booby trap the back door with a shotgun butter around eleven thirty AM he opened the door to feed some squirrels\nWell guess what the shotgun went off\nShot him he went to the hospital he's going to be OK other than the fact is neighbors are never ever going to let him down ever never ever I mean come on all the troubles are rigged the shotgun\nTo keep guys or break it into your house first of all do you disguised the shotgun do you do you put a what a lamp shade over it do you you hang a tarp over at like all out just a tent or something that I have no answer too but I Would just like to point out that you no matter what\nYour challenges are most likely are not going to try to set up a shotgun on your back porch that goes up whenever you open your door okay you even if you did set up that shotgun\nI'm going to bet that you would remember that and if you decided to go out there and feed the squirrels you'd either a walk around the house or be just throw a bunch of nuts out there anyway well in advance so the squirrels could feed themselves that their leisure\nI give you credit so remember no matter what your challenges are no matter what is driving me crazy no matter what you think is keeping you back\nNo matter what is causing you to question your sanity your intelligence and your self esteem I just want to remind you you're not a guy who set up a shotgun on his own back patio and then opened the door and set it off shooting yourself\nOn\nYour not\nThis guy [noise] in my life sucks any particular [noise]\nAh yes saw right there you go a you are not that good boy that would be very embarrassed can you imagine that when that guy gets home from the hospital\nHis neighbors hey how's it going I'm All right we're going to come over later will come in
