at no I didn't I thought that\nPass a that a rough in the past year call I thought that I didn't think that I mean how does a guy stopped his momentum he was in his face when he threw the ball so yeah that\nWas you know I Know I could I'll be honest I was on the other end I was a hundred and twenty yards away from the call I was on the other end\nZone that line but even I couldn't see from there that that was a horrible call [laughter] I\nWas at that point I'm like well they're on the one yard line the breath is going to win this game I mean there's very few teams that you know Ninety nine no time out I\nMean every time you tackle a guy in balance with no time outs that's like a thirty second play twenty five second play right and so [laughter]\nWhen he started talking about it even more I mean getting frustrated about it I'm Aaron Williams was the guy I felt like that that that struggled and Scott profit Clinton they will just beat him he had a good day\nThey targeted Aaron Williams in the passing game ten times and he gave up ten catches for about a hundred and Seventy hundred eighty eighty arts here at Fort penalties on the day two of them were declined\nI'm so just not a day for him at that Nicole corner which probably wasn't honestly a good match for me going against the shift the fast walk receiver and and that's one maybe a wonder if they would have looked at it again with the match that up differently because that was the one guy that continually ever ask if northwestern it wasn't running backs\nBut a quarterback or sixty two passes the second most passes a team is ever throw around the brass in history there's been two teams that have thrown a it was sixty four actually Saturday I think that record is sixty eight that's happening wife\nWell so they threw it around and and the brass was up for challenge for fifty five minutes of that game and then the last five they they want you\nKnow something as I point out positives here I'm going to say that the play of the divine as a bowl has been just\nOff the charts I think that uh that he's been spectacular or since earning that starting position and to me that's that's kind of what has gr football's all about tough guys earning that starting position and then delivering and yeah there's other players doing well as a you know starting as well but\nI I have really enjoy watching that guy play I mean he's he's definitely not playing like he was playing two years ago under Mike Riley\nYeah in put it in perspective pro football focus great it out of I Know it's like those game on Saturday as the number one great it out running back in the country\nAnd what really jumped out to me Chris was about eighty percent of his yard on their on their charts came after contacts so it wasn't like he was getting necessarily great blocking because northwestern the way they play defense you're not going to get a lot of this big holes\nHe he was running through guys and running what purpose and um that that there was a lot of effort to his day and you know he was recognized as the top grade it out running back in the country for Saturday's performance\nYeah I just I'm just really enjoy watching that guy play I loved I loved guys that you know because it seemed to me that that he was kind of being written off and next thing you know now I mean he fought in there and started his way into the starting line up and he's delivering week after week and I just think it's great\nYeah you kind of was written off I mean you remember last year they it took a few games are for even solve the feel that\nYou know he got his opportunity but it was you know he didn't get great opportunity last year he's definitely leaving it all out there as a senior and now let's go when some games and you've got Minnesota coming in the brass cause a three point favorite three and a half point favors they started out three you know but they've lost her last three games\nUm so they're they're you know they struggle and the brass can might be getting the golfers or the right time they're getting in the week after they played Ohio State\nIn Ohio State probably beat him around pretty good last week in that game so I'm hopefully that will help Nebraska this week at home\nYeah All right All right John Callahan while we look forward to this next big game it'll be great get that's first Scott Ross one at home\n[laughter] go way probably what happened and they were\nProbably thinking well we got this game at hand here at Northwestern but you know I really think coach frost started when his first one at home so when I was you know tell you what a Carlos once you buzz through there and knock down the quarterback and make the rap man what the heck we'll get we'll get Scott is a first one at home I think that's I'm going to go with that\nThat's what I'm going with [laughter] All right well we'll see I mean but you know I'm I'm\nNext hour as well Gary in GMO we'll talk more about it\nYeah it'd be

they're getting flag because they are poor technique I'm In a case of of the Davis flag at the end I personally don't like it\nBut they're calling that every time if you hit the guy in the head and if
