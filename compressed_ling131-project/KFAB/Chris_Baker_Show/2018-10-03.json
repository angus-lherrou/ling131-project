know what are these with these people trying to do what I think\nWhat they were doing is just exploring what ... what I think what they've done is they've asked the planning department to look at what other cities have done how they've done it and basically what is it going to cost because depending on what we implement the cost of this could be outrageous if you think about having to inspect eighty thousand property\nYou know how many how many inspectors we would need but um you know we've got you probably need forty or fifty inspectors\nWe have ten so you're going to add ... thirty five thirty five to forty full time employees to the city the cost of that is going to be enormous and they say well that's why we're targeting the landlord that's why you have a registry you have to pay and then that'll pay for the program up as you know that never works\nWell first of all either we'd have to charge an exorbitant amount of money on a minimal amount of money or yeah you know it doesn't work because by the way you hire that many fulltime employees you have to pay benefits they're going to be on that you know put that while they be on the cash balance plan I guess for the inspectors but\nYou're still going to have other costs in addition to the salaries and right now we have I Believe\nTo open positions unless they've been filled but as of when we were doing the budget over the summer we had to\nEmpty positions not because the mayor said don't hire 'em but because planning says we're trying to hire somebody we can't find good qualified candidates who actually want

[noise]\nBy radio eleven ... can't they be encouraging this somehow firefighters rescued one person and the dog from a smoky\nFire at the Boulder um apartments attempt in Leavenworth this afternoon salt\n[noise] oh yeah I wouldn't say that it yeah I think guys are just getting more and on board and the guys that don't want to compete or work that maybe came in Nebraska for a different agenda things aren't going that way on that particular agenda they originally came or for their just leaving at this point and\nSeen that are ready to go back and look at that two thousand Seventeen or CRE class nine of those\nGuys have either left already are never your ... to Lincoln\nUm so that recruiting class in general when you look at the pure numbers there may only be four or five guys that contribute a with Brennan Hi ms and Damien Daniels being far and away the two best guys that entire recruiting class than\nI mean there was a lot of hopes and dreams tied to that class I mean we we covered it a lot we talk about a lot of people made these caliber ask a T shirt eight thousand people showed up to a summer football camp to watch these guys are memorial stadium\nAs we're learning it it just kind of fell through like a big Ponzi scheme\nAnd yet here we are that's around zero trying\nTo rein in our house it was a big Ponzi scheme oh well that's too bad sucks to be them so ah heading into a the Wisconsin game Wisconsin they got they have a massive offensive line um you\nKnow it it's not a game that I'm expecting any giant upset but I think\nThat we're going to see a lot a lot better effort and I'm hoping sharper football\nIn other words less penalties guys being when they're supposed to be a cause I don't know about you Sean I look at this whole thing where you know guys getting bench guys quitting or this this seems to me that you know this this is a moment where I think that will look back and say okay this is where people started figuring out\nHow they're going to play football here in Nebraska\nYeah it's kind of a draw a line in the sand type moment I don't\nCare what you were ranked as a recruit ... the highest ranked troops in two thousand eight all of our jacks and another\nNational top one hundred level recruit I don't care all I care about is building this thing the way I Want to build it and I made no promises to you the only promises I've made is I'm going to play the best guys that are bought into this culture to want to work and compete at the way we want to do it\nYeah well I'm I'm fine with that I think it's great and like I said well look back we'll look back on this day and say okay this is when people started to figure it out that we're gonna we're going to where we want excellence it doesn't matter who you are and what got you hear is what you do when you are here that's what I hear this is\nNot about the short term I mean if it was just trying to squeeze out a few wins\nThey wouldn't be doing some of these things they're looking at what they want to do and built in the future and Scott Ross is one of the rare coaches here that has the ability to do this you know Mike Riley bow plenty bill Callahan they didn't really have the luxury to do things like this because I think the pressure was a lot higher on a lot of those guys\nYeah I'm ... and everything [laughter] things are at where they're at now on top of the backing\nCommitment made the Scott for off that he can get away not get away but he's able to do these types of things I think Nebraska and I hope our understanding and supportive in what other not going to pass on the head rafts back in practice um today they haven't had a raft in practice since August\nOr during scrimmage is I'm starting this week and you know every Tuesday Wednesday going forward or they're going to practice officials that are Big Ten certified wrapping everything in practice and they've got to address it they're ranked second to last right now and penalty yards and total penalties individual one football\nAh running the stairs or anything like that I'm just wondering you know\nThere are averaging ... penalties in Ninety seven penalty yards per game so they're bringing back the practice wraps and it's something that Scott Frost didn't do at Central Florida but probably thought that they didn't have in their budget I mean you have to pay a raft hundred bucks apiece\nTwice a week which is an expense um that not every program probably can't afford it we add that up fake twice a week that's sixteen hundred bucks a week times four times a month I mean that that is quite an expense that have referees but it's a well we're worthwhile expense\nUm if it can help you clean up the penalty problems that we've seen here for the brass 'cause the last few weeks\nYeah All right All right John Callahan as always we appreciate it let me just send you out with some slow groove\nHere and ah yeah they get on the whole birthday and yeah I can then [laughter]
