an interesting anytime something like this happens the first reaction of the political class is well people need to tone down the rhetoric you know people need to do this and they never once reflect on their own actions and their own words and their own lives and their own deceit and their own double standards\nThat could possibly cause the person to take such a horrible\nTrack in life okay and I can sit here and lay out a litany of examples of that coming from both sides of the political aisle okay all\nYou want one fine I'll give you one in fact I'll even pull one where we could bash

gets elected the president of the United states and says\nWe want to build a wall he also said Mexico's going to pay for it right let's be honest there ain't no wall I Try to shut eye and\nMexico said screw you are not going to pay for it only tell you something going on down there in Mexico\nThe United states of America has been giving the country of Mexico billions of dollars just for security okay we've been we've been paying for their police forces we've been buying their police vehicles and the whole idea was to help them stand up to the drug cartels\nThe drug cartels run Mexico we've been given these jerks billions of dollars and the Mexico the Mexican police the Mexican army can't stop the Honduran hoard from coming up through Mexico\nSo this president is saying okay you can't stop them I'm cutting off your aid\nAnd we got people whining and complaining about\nThat the same politicians that we're talking about being tough on the border the St politicians that we're talking about border security we've got to do something about drugs are going to do something about ... no we had to do something about ah all this crazy chaos coming across that border\nOne guy says we need to build a wall or if you guys don't stop his horde of Hondurans were going to cut off your aid and now they're crying and sniff a lot about that\nThat infuriates me and I think it infuriates a lot of people right when we see politicians live by a completely different set of rules than we have to live by okay let me ask you this do you think you can ignore some pay a subpoena from the United States
