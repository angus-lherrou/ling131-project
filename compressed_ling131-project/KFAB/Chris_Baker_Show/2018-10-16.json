I was a moron or did you just sit there and think it no I kind of agree with you oh okay I Do I feel sorry for her\nBecause here sure her her lawsuit against the president was thrown out of court\nShe now has to pay the president's legal fees and I know that I've had numerous e mails and seen this on social media that you know she had this ah go fund me page where people were giving her money and now that money is apparently going to go to pay the president's legal fees lab lab lab lab lay\nI feel bad for her because\nThere's I see what's coming down the pike and that is she's going to get a

goofy for saying that but it's true I Do I feel sorry\nFor her why do I feel sorry for her because just because of her career choice she's\nBeen discounted marginalized all because she made a career choice would obviously a career choice that that most of us would not make more of us would never admit to knowing about it\nBut just because she's made this choice I don't think there's any reason to ride her off of it as if she's less of a human being\nAs if she is less of a woman\nAnd so I Do is first of all I don't even think that she ever had any action what the president I really don't uh
