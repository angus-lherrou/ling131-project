timely because Camille has a new book and it's a collection of essays over the years\nShe is a legitimate feminist she's not a militant new wage than fat she regrets and very much abhors\nSecond wave feminism which is what she calls the modern era I trace it back to the late sixties early seventies second wave feminism she thinks is\nHas been horrible for everybody and I just have a couple of soundbites here she speaks like a machine gun so make sure you listened fast\nHere in the Nineteen twenties Nineteen thirties that's neat is my favorite period in feminist them because these women admired what men\nAnd there was no male bashing and became the nicks okay the second wave feminism absolute poison spreading worldwide\nBased on denigrating Noam ... might have done a defining men as as a practicing tyrants their history okay in absolute lie there hadn't been crimes against women where they have occurred we must condemn them\nThroughout history have given their lives and their land or for the support them women and children I thought this is an element of second wave feminism and to me is the next Appalachian I'm neurotic system on the part of the matter is if I knew about talking to this movement\nNeurotic system on the part of the ... we're talking psychological disorders that have now assumed a political identity or political issues but man is she right on the money with this the feminism she says she admires never sought\nTo denigrate and destroy managed to miss current was never a male versus female thing and she of course this and she you know she is a ... she's an art expert an analyst and a cultural professor University of the arts in Philadelphia I'm\nHere this this one this next bite from the same battle of Ideas Festival in London a couple of years ago this I predict will sound familiar\nTo human beings need religion they need a religious perspective cosmic with respect him and getting rid of the orthodox religions because they were they must do conservative has simply led to the new religion not political correctness and at the same kind of fanaticism\nI may have found that the second wave feminists now it's like the Spanish Inquisition I'm not getting any anything with any form of dissent even within feminism is treated as heresy ... and they actually tried to destroy you\nKnow you would think that a an ongoing professor\nIn this modern era wouldn't be recommending and advocating for modern day feminism but you would be that rock she is she's right on the money for goes if you haven't heard this little stories sixty minutes once profiled me way way back when they thought I was heartless\nAnd they profiled her at some point to and it came time for them to have their twenty fifth anniversary dinner earth thirtieth or whatever it was\nAnd they it was at the temple of dengue are exhibit at the museum on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan\nAnd they invited me and they sat me at her table because they thought that there would be fireworks\nThey thought that I Would refuse and that I wouldn't get into arguments and I would have actually walk out and I we got along famously and during the night\nThere Steve Croft walking by take it all I didn't get it at first and then ... say for what started walking by a ticket and then they were given a and brass at one of these guys leaving their table they all expected fireworks at our table\nAnd they were hoping to see it and of course they didn't get it\nBecause we uh we had a lovely time that night so [noise] just just amazing as it is and I it took me a while to figure out you know what they were what they were doing\nWith this and I was naive back in those days at anyway that's a brief break before we wrap it up\nOn his own awful rash probably miss radio on living\nThey folks the IRS does not mess around you know this they have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck even your home in business\nNow if you all back taxes it's about to get worse the IRS has added a small army of private tax collectors and their job is to find you to track you down\nYou need to co opt them a tax relief they're the good guys the experts who do this best\nThey're experts in a fresh start initiative that's a special IRS program that could save you thousands even tens of thousands if you're qualified one call can start the process to stop the

consultation now it's free calling you have options eight hundred nine seven three seven\nEver since they decided to send in shock troops to the Yale park apartment complex and um I uh I still am going to stick by what I said earlier and as we've talked about this I think this is a\nIs a power movement a land grab I don't know who's doing it but I think that this was a power moving a land grab\nAnd frankly I'm just going to stop it that I'm not going to start putting people in fact I'll do this I'll say it's Josh\nJosh the producer of the show it's a power Lou land grab by going here ... am I missing this up yeah All right but then I'm going to go back to my original statement that I'm not going to throw any names around I think the fact that I'm spotting this land grab a\nUh I yeah whatever and and power move yes\nSo anyway we'll find out from a senator Justin Wayne a about this and how this is going to work and all those great things are so we'll be doing a big show today are also on the ... program today in fact I just talked about it just for a moment right now the president\nA signed a historic piece of legislation today a a a basically it's the music modernization act and what this does is make sure that ah musicians producers\nTo make sure that they get paid in the digital era\nUh in fact ah musicians and artists are back in the early seventies before Nineteen Seventy two or they're now going to get paid and I I Am one hundred percent but ... but behind this bill\nJust because of the simple fact that these people are artist\nThey put out content and I know that some people get get annoyed when someone says well you know they're an artist\nThey are artist but what they put out is content you know it's just maybe it's a song maybe it's a comedy album whatever it may be it it all comes down to one thing and that's content\nAnd that content has value and there are many people who have written great songs and put out great content many many years ago\nAnd they don't get paid yet or various other entities do\nOkay your music streaming services even radio stations well that's going to put me in a bad light around here uh they're making money right they play that they play the content they sell advertising they play the content they have concerts they play the content they do all kinds of things\nAnd people who created that content for for a long time and now she did and they don't to me in person\nI don't think that's a playing field that will ever be leveled but you know you take what you can get a so people are going to get paid for their work All right and especially when it comes to the the world of music\nOr you know you're lucky if you write one song that any one even knows All right I mean think of the odds against riding a hit song where people flock\nThey flock to get that man I've got to get that song got to hear that song the odds of someone doing that in a lifetime or astronomical\nSo if you're able to hit the jackpot if you're able to grab that brass ring if you're able to stumble upon something like this then you need to be compensated so I I I support this and I think this is a great thing that the president has done today so they're regarded coming up on the program\nOr just in Wayne is going to join a state senator Justin Wayne who is uh from what I've been\nTold a going to file legislation\nSurrounding these this this this what I call power move\nOut of start regulating rental properties and it's something we we all want to be paying attention to because I'm just not a big fan of uh overreaching government and we'll see what Justin wanes idea is before I started saying it's horrible\nWill wait until we find out the details then we'll call it horrible but I won't call it
