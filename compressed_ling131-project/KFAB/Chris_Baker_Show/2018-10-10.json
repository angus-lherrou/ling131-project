hit Georgia as a hurricane\nThere and then there's the eye and then it comes in I mean if people not figured out the whole concept of a hurricane yet no offense I get it\nIt's big hurricane we've had big hurricanes before\nOkay a but it it it's you know history begins in the morning it's hurricane all we've got to go through it all again who got reporters outstanding in a hurricane and I was watching earlier today where they were asking reporters windy\nYes yes there's a lot of wind with a hurricane so what does the wind do\nWell the wind um what is the wind do it blows\nMuch like your broadcast right now I'm just saying ah I Would think that\nThey would figure out the hurricane tornado came through the area last night known as the Trump NATO\nAnd we had a very good time out of Hooters yesterday and a meeting all of you and it was so awesome to see the joy and happiness uh of of everyone was there I mean people were happy people were in a great motive was a very festive spirit\n[noise] [noise] um [noise] I don't know how to describe it I got home last night and uh I watch\nThe uh Trump's speech if you want to call it a speech they ought to just start calling this an evening with Trump hanging out you know my wife uh this is it in this\nUm disappoint I'm getting out and I'm just wondering how many people that run into this recently last night I sat there with my lovely wife and we watch the Trump NATO route\nAnd I'm very familiar with the president I followed this guy for years way before he ever was the president way before he ever had that TV show The Apprentice which by the way I never watched\nUh I I've been very very I'm very familiar with the president Donald Trump very familiar and\nSo I have always known what we're getting I've always known exactly what kinda presidential candidate he would be I've always know what kinda business ... years I've always known that he is a guy who is bigger than life\nWhen you meet him uh he has a warmth that unless you meet him it would be impossible to comprehend um\nMy wife is watching last night and she said to me she turned to me and she said you are so hot then All right I I just do that in a but she said\nTo me um you know I really liked the guy I just wish I just wish he was more elegant\nAnd I of course it you know as most people will respond well what an elegance get us\nAnd she said no no I I Know what you mean right this guy's done more in a couple of years than than\nTwo three presidents before him\nBut I just wish that he was more elegant\nYou know at one point when the when the Trump NATO said or where the hell am I who the hell am I talking to you never see the president of the United states say stuff like that my wife even made a comment to me last night she said this guy this is the most effective president we've had\nSince Ronald Reagan and of course but she said that I\nJust said you're so hot right through that and again but I was glad to hear that because I see it the same way but I was just really strict ... it really struck me\nAt how the substance of what he does and the substance of what he says and I know that there are people that would probably argue there's not a lotta substance to what he says 'cause he's just he's just stay he's a broiler\nA and I just was really struck me that my wife saw it in such a way I just wish he was more elegant and she even agreed with me well elegance what does that get us\nWe need action I'm just curious a and I'd like to ask somebody you uh men about this new women I Love women um\nDoes he strike you that way too I Know that uh Ben Sasse our senator\nUh I get from my conversations with him that he would like to see a more elegant president he would like to see a man who were strains himself this guy does not restrain himself he's never had to in the past he's always been\nA businessman a construction guy a broiler in New York City so he's never had to worry about constraining himself but he's never had to worry about checking his language has never had to worry about All right what am I going to say should I say that\nAll those things that politicians of the past have had to worry about he's never had to worry about it and as obvious that he still doesn't worry about it I don't know about you I find it refreshing but I again it it it just really struck me that that my wife\nWas longing for a bit of class a bit of civility just a little bit of toys you\nKnow he's walking around the stage and you know you never see a president do that your president walks up to the podium and he gives a speech trumps walking around the stage he's pointing he's like what what what they won't even turn the cameras are as my favorite parts like my my two favorite parts last night where one when he was imitating the general talking to him\nSir ... says the guy how much is it so [laughter] I thought it was hysterical um\nAnd then the part where he said they won't even turn the cameras around and show you how big this crowd is you know those things I ... I Love it when he talks like that my wife on the other hand she would like for him to leave it out\nShe thinks she's a great president she thinks he's successful she loves America First\nIt's the toys that she that concert I'm just curious\nIf she alone All right anyway Chris bigger radio program coming up on the show or we're going to have a big lesson or listen to this ... boy do I have something for you today we're gonna have a big lesson in politics and posturing\nVery excited about this Rand Paul thinks there's going to be an assassination also\nIf you don't like the dry cleaning business\nSell the dry cleaning business I don't want to cast any is perversion has been when we find out that that fire at a hundred and sixty eight than Harrison was according to the inspector arson\nAnd I got a few questions about that so we're going to explore all this coming up on the prospect of radio program on news radio eleven ten K. if maybe\nThe Chris maker ... return from ten minutes NOW News radio eleven ... maybe ... dot com\nCarbs complete ... is an elite preferred dreams hardy contractor and it's certified certainty single pastor or free estimate on a new roof origins hardy citing carpet four to six five one fourteen Ninety three or visit carts\nOmaha dot com is moving difficult is the pain impacting your lifestyle let the specialist in Nebraska is fine hospital help you live surgery is right for you visit Nebraska spine hospital dot com ... to keep your spine healthy and to learn more about spine conditions and procedures\nHardy and American clubs in the affirmation patterning perfect now asked Johnson who's being marvel at the crafting creativity if they're from the Eighteen hundreds today as the example that these hairs object bowl and design and patterns in Joplin first ever expedition devoted to\nRemember when you had a full head of hair what if I told you you could have a full head of hair again your own hair without unsightly scarring\nThanks to the all do robotic hair transplants system the first in the mid west performed exclusively by Dr adjusted missed go at J. miss go surgical design feel at ease with the skilled hands if a surgeon having a full head of hair will change your life and\nLast a lifetime we will go men and women for a free consultation James go surgical design ...

districts nothing and Troy Walter said we've got to do a better job of\nGetting off to a better start our defense actually helped us out early give us a chance and we couldn't repay that favor to them so that's something to watch 'em one other interesting nugget involving the former staff we learned today ...\nNebraska it's former defensive coordinator who had the largest assistant coach contract in Nebraska history has now been elevated to a full time coach at Oklahoma with the firing of my students\nAre now the ... going to be the line backers coached not the coordinator metal ...\nBut we put a request and um for his salary information you only make forty eight thousand at Oklahoma\nThen store next point was what does that do to the payout Nebraska\n... well today we learned that Bob ... such a good contract with his unheard of versus the coaches that when he was fired um he was basically given everything is eight hundred and Seventy thousand year one lump sum payment um which\nUh Disney reveal the forty eight thousand they've ever mattered in Nebraska is they've already paid out by ... tirade or Seventy dollars a year\nSo it was that the end of it or do we have next year to pay him to\nKnow that ... that oh okay I'm\nAssistant coach contracts are generally two years and once you gain employment um you know they they subtract difference will and the ...\nCase whatever way more in taxes [laughter] you got it all\nLike you got the whole thing um and you know it tells you have the time how desperate shot I course was to get that deal done because you don't the assistant coaches get a deal like that very often if ever I'm where they say you won't give you everything if you're fired on one payment\nI'm In a long line of work man\nTypically you break that out over twelve payments and if you gain employment you deduct everything from that well he was able to get everything I'm On that eight Seventy or from Nebraska no\nGood good for I guess in\nWhen that deal came through they needed to get the coordinator hired and you think about it way back when they fired banker and the I don't do it and they didn't do it and they they they I'm sure I didn't think he'd be fired eventually down the road either so\nUm but yeah it's final ah through it all now Nebraska's still owes between Mike Riley ... three other assistant coaches out there that are still in the tap
