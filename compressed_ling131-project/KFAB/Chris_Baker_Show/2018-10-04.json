{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "Binary choice about the much broader issue of whether we do or don't care about when that is simply not true that is not what we're doing this weekend\nThat is Senator Ben Sasse thank goodness this guy has come out there to try to bring some sanity to this and uh I got a lot of emails from people last night said you hear my bed Saturday hates\nTrump he is the\nMost articulate member of that body\nAnd do I agree with everything no I I don't there are things I disagree with but there are so minor that I really don't care\nSenator Ben Sasse really laid it out last night and he took these people to school\nFor so many of them are asking the last two weekends when I've been home\nHave been much more nuanced than the kind of screaming we hear on battling cable news channels a Supreme Court confirmation vote isn't a grand choice about whether we love our daughters or whether we trust our sons that is not the choice before us this is a consent decision about one person for one seat\nAgain I'm not here to talk tonight about the particular vote there's lots of lobbying going on around this body right now I'm not here to talk about that particular vote\nSee the thing that I like about Ben Sasse and I think the thing that people misunderstand about him is that Ben Sasse\nWants people to be dignified he wants people to be statesman he wants the constitution to work the way it is supposed to and in my opinion he is absolutely one hundred percent accurate\nWay he says that these people have forgotten about the constitution they've forgotten about the rule of law they've forgotten about the dignity of their office and they've forgotten what they owe you an or the American people\nThey owe us a responsible behavior they owe us to follow a system okay here's a deal you people last the last election you'll lost it a Supreme Court seat became vacant\nThe president appointed a replacement\nAre here we go about doing what about what about those guys they cheated Obama the\nRepublicans played that just stood there ... stupid they should have gone through the process had the hearings checked out his record discussed\nWhether or not had the debate gone through the process the way they were supposed to\nThey didn't shame on them but guess what I'm consistent because I said at the time you don't like the guy you don't want to put the gun Supreme Court go through the process and they don't vote to advance his nomination that's what party control of that body is about\nBut know what they do they figured oh no we're gonna share buddy one butch tough guys we are we're not going to do anything we can see where the arms folded me because it showed me\nThe mentality of an eight year old thank goodness Ben Sasse has come out to bring some sanity to this right we'll have more Ben Sasse audio and those would be that hate him or to yell at me you can do that to you Chris make a radio show a
