visit in February and uh finally went on a visit him I didn't really agree with them being down there but uh they had a good time they they uh were safe but\nEverybody that had a any property or a businessman or anybody that had any money at a house with a huge wall around it with barbed wire on the top and armed guards\nSell though to your daughter save\nThe tall wall armed guards and ah they were very smart and vigilant whenever they went out you know they went to the market they always were with people and and they had armed guards and stuff too so\nDid they ever talk about are things that were going on in Honduras while they were there\n[noise] yeah there were they they a witness that few um they didn't see the killings but some killings happened close by um I saw a lot of a lot of poor people but I saw a lot of uh the people with the well I'm like I said they had a\nLot of the students at that school they had to um lemme drivers and the SUVs that were totally tinted windows every window was hit that you can even see in the in the\nCar yeah or these armored cars to your knowledge up they they probably were er yeah um\nThey um they have body guards that drop the kids off

of Middle Eastern descent that were ... puzzles from the south is that not correct\nWell that's been going on for quite some time in fact there was a story last week that I Believe in Guatemala they pulled out uh what was somebody set up so I Can't remember the number a hundred or a thousand or\nWhatever it just said terrorist and I'm thinking well okay how do you know there are terrorists did they lay hair you look at terrorist odd darned you got me you know I mean they do that\nLet me propose something because you happen to be a man that knows people of political power how about this anyone who sponsors people infiltrating this convoy this this uh uh invading way are sponsors of terrorism I mean would that not qualified to say that that's\nNot a lawyer but I don't know how they would make that ... that leap\nWhy bet your Trump get make it because here's what\nI mean is there I mean I I don't speak for the president I'm just looking at this from a practical perspective you can you say well you are as helping this a mob on their way up here therefore you're sponsoring\nTerror well maybe ... but what I'm trying to get out on a technicality is sort of suspend some of his\nBillion dollars to cause the nefarious people to infiltrate groups of people to come here to do was political damage but I think maybe he should spend some of ... billion dollars to defend himself an\nInternational corners yard you know\nWell okay that sounds once you do me a favor and go arrest him giving his address\nI don't have that just you had George Soros his address and then we ... we hang out a law and order known that he had an old\nMan without prior special forces forty five years re rescued I'll take\nYour you would uh I think George Soros has more homes than Bernie
