Sean Lindsey also left the team\nHad really yet from from the anarchy would expect and and I would always what with confidence kinda kinda built their office on and kind of filter identity office with a with a strong running game with\nWith the office of Wyman kind of leading the way and and so I think it's really easy to uh to kind of slip away from\nFrom a winning culture and an identity that you have a even if you have enough to stay in it\nA long time like Wisconsin so I don't know to breath or I I think higher you got to stop the guy that that was there during their here and there ... years and and when they were actually winning I think that could\nThat could be the key that could that could really help I'm kind of get them back to that point out obviously that didn't work so far but it's only four games that I write it rocked the chance to be really successful there in a loft here\nWell I Do too and and we're seeing signs of the other culture being implemented here in Nebraska because uh the last two days we've had a couple of players that were highly\nHighly touted recruits have decided you know I'm going to pack up my junk I'm going to go somewhere else because they got demoted they were starting they're not starting now\nThey got replaced by people that were working harder\nAnd now they've decided okay you know what I'm I'm gone I'm going to go somewhere else where no one's going to challenge me\nAnd I think that you know and I wanted to point this out because Wisconsin does have a as a rough tough football culture or some is you know it's pretty much what Nebraska was many many years ago before someone decided to try to make it a pretty football team\nOr do you think there was constant is getting to see you know watching Wisconsin I personally I don't think that that they're getting the respect uh that they deserve not only in a big tent but in a college football in general are due badger fancy it that way or am I may be looking too deep into this\n[noise] well I I think in the past that it's probably been the case but but I honestly think the cutting into the seat and they were getting a lot of high they are they are a number forty eight people to start a year and a lot of people were actually taken into whether they tend to see that and then they they really haven't started off well you know they had the last you argue that kind of shocked everybody and\nThey were able to pull that went out in Iowa a couple of weeks ago but they didn't even still didn't really play well in that game so I think at this point they they're gonna have to kind of\nA you know ... you know re prove themselves I guess to everybody in the country people even before the season that I think at this point people don't really think they have any chance to make the to rebounded and win games at Michigan at Penn State and ... and things like that but um I I think a lot of people including myself at the defense is kind of\nFalling off a little bit from recent years as well as some of the started they had to replace and the off season but uh you know that they'll have a chance you know over the next couple of weeks they they go at Michigan next week and they played in state November and they'll have a chance to kind of show that that BYU game was was was more of a one off game rather than\nRather than who they are so I I Do think that you're all different that that they could actually get a lot of respect for the free season and it hasn't really\nWorked out yet but we'll see how they read them\nYeah I I still think that there are dangers team I think they can win and uh I'm not writing them off so uh but you know um what do I know about division one football I've never played nor coach so who the heck am I anyway listen I Want to thank you very much Jason best of luck to you and your team this weekend\nAnd uh when we build our culture I just want to quote Scott Frost you'd better\nGet us now okay just just pass it around okay [noise] yeah you know I mean some of the\nThe guys leaving earlier um program I I'm I'm doing a story on on our Ninety three rows walking right now and you know and when he came in Nineteen Ninety a you know he had more than that the players like the program and at first off season and they wouldn't want it said in his first year in in three years later they were\nKobe can champions and in one of the rose bowl\nYeah see it all turns around and I think Wisconsin really is is somewhere that in a brass fans can looked at and say you know what that we can we're going to be right there is we just got to go
