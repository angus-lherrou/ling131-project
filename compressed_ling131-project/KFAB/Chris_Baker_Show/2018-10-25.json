tuned and Amazon Prime and may Taylor joins ... joining a welcome to the show\nThank you for having me pleasure to be here\nSo I'm Glad to ah to talk with you because I'm so glad that you have done this project because I\nHave been so suspicious of these giant tech companies I applaud their ingenuity but\nI also know that every living creature wants to be on top they want to be the winner\nAnd uh I've always been suspicious and I've also felt that the the Internet and all this high tech all these gives Moses some would say that we now have at our fingertips have been used like a a like a heroin dealer or turns people ended junkies they they they hooked us\nThey got us all sucked into it and now\nThe rules seem to be changing is that\nIs that what got you involved in this project\nAbsolutely I mean what we used to have a barrier between us technology we could turn off TV and go outside you can get away from it um [noise] leave the opposite\nNow uh we had no barrier with that technology is integrated into our lives um there's no way to get away from it and you know we have to start reflecting on what is it on me take that free email what is the cost that free email and for us we don't think that's where the product you're getting it\nMay Taylor is our guest or the movie is called the creepy line it's available on iTunes also Amazon Prime and let's go let's go back into what they did it just seems to me that they just kind of sucked us in and we really kinda signed up for this whole thing\nAbsolutely I mean look this isn't a in a we gave our our identities we gave up our our freedom\nOr we gave up all of the details I mean most people don't think about it I guess you could tell ... more than you tell your your best friend ... held them everything and they collect it all uh and then they take that information to advertisers\nGovernment and in some instances law enforcement and so they have very low profile and everything you do and I would argue they probably know things about you they don't know about yourself [noise]\nUm and so the question is what are their motor\nAnd that's really what we're trying to get down and uh\nA what the creepy line fighting so far what do you think their motives are I I have\nAn idea I own idea what I think the motives are but what are you what do you think their motives are\nWell you know then I think about it and it's been a number of leaks recently or whether it's the good censor ah or the number of videos internally about you know Google um and also by such and Facebook are there either utopian they you know want to make money in one respect\nBut they have a world view that they want to push into 'em or an actor in our world they want to build the world and the thing is is now they they're playing politics\nAnd if they have the power to change and ships political perspective um one day and we think they very much what we think they have and we think they're doing it right now I'm In of course you can break it down to like oh they vote this way or they have these leanings\nUm but but the more the fact that like how did they get the power of the ship the things in these directions and shift our opinions without us know\nAnd so that's really kind of are concerned that they could undermine democracy doesn't matter what views are the fact that they could do it at all or is a huge problem\nUh when we left off we were talking about um Alexa right I don't like this election thing\nAnd my wife has you know my wife loves Alexa set the alarm Alexa do this Alexa blah blah blah\nAnd I'm telling my wife listen ... don't get don't get hooked on this tell us a little bit more about Alexa\nWell you know the home devices and you know there's Alexei Google Home and you know of course the apple has a home ... theory these devices are always listening and really I think a kind of a fundamental issue\nAt least I have with these devices is that you know Google has been wants to be the arbiter of information right there the there is a member of the good denser\nAnd what the devices are doing is as opposed to Google picking and links and providing you with an auction their options are on their only providing you with one option is single option a single answer\nOn and so I think that if there is in fact by if we believe there is and we know that that's how the search and works\nUm than there will be fired the single answer on the other thing is that they're listening and they're they're they're picking up the information that you speak about your wife when\nThey when you're not thinking about the Alexa or the Google Home and its transmitting it back to the home based\nOn that how it works how it gets it are making the returns you um and so and it from my understanding and I can't verify this theory may also ah from apple may also be happening in the Google or make them ever Google it there that that they had the biggest search engine they've done the most work\nThey click it the most data they return the most answers or they understand it and that's how they're able to get the information but I think that when they are picking one answer\nOne answer to all the mall and you ask a question and if it isn't the answer we think that's true and that can get their opinion so I think a home devices are concerning uh simply because who they're tied into so they're listening all week\nBut I Want to talk about this thing just listening deal because that's where the wife and I ... I keep telling her they're listening you know that you know they're listening when when people say that they're listening\nIs there like a bank um guys sitting there with headphones just listening or is it somehow or some system where where it's a automatically catching buzz words are key words\nWell I mean again I I'm not the engineer but from my understanding is they are with the court he sprays uh-huh I'm\nYou know so you know for example you know you have a home hot and you say hey theory I'm it will wake it up but that means it has\nTo be listening for [noise] for it or hate eerie right I'm hopefully I don't set up a set off any devices right now where I Am\nSurrounded by apple things [laughter] but\nBut the thing is is that they're listening to watch your phone um and of course these devices so hey you know as a theory taking notes and they will do it so it is with us today it doesn't mean that it treads meeting at that time um but there have been reports than we do have a specific report that we highlight in the film\nThat talk about how Google Home divide was in fact ... ... ... feet without and asking and transmitting it back to Google\nSo here's the thing you put this thing in your house you don't really know how it works and you don't know what it's really do it and they say oh yeah it does this and that does that\nYou don't no way to verify any of that and this is not a company I trust because they have they have been repeatedly part over and over and over again either leaking or information are violating our trucks so why would I Believe that it's one

radio show election coming up Medicare expansion [noise] that's a very tough topic to talk about because it's incredibly important and it's the same time it's incredibly boring [noise]\nSo uh let me just lay it out real quick carries a deal a Medicaid expansion if ... if it passes in Nebraska three years from now it's going to cost a hundred million dollars\nAnd that's a conservative estimate by the way so when you hear these people tell you well it's going to create all these jobs and stuff but I don't know what they based that on I really don't know what they base it I guess they say it's gonna create all these jobs to administrate ah the ah Medicare expansion\nThere's I don't I don't know what they they they measure that on and we'll find out as the week goes on\nBut I'd like to know what they base those findings on water and not spend all this kind of money and people got shovels papers\nOr if that's the best you got that's crazy\nAll right so that three years from now they passed Medicaid expansion right and you want to get people you want health care for everybody I got it I get it but there's better ways to do this than to burden the tax payer three years from now with a one hundred million dollar tab so in other words just so we're clear\nThe feds are going to help out for three years after three years you're on your own\nK. they're going to take the leash law for you and then I ... in fact I guarantee this is going to happen there's going to be so many strings attached such as well uh you're going to qualify for the Medicare expansion benefit\nBut oh look

um so he's obviously all of us don't cook and uh and he's now ... sans ... coach for quite some time so that connection is there\nAnd uh from from what they told me is a shot back to be called up somewhere over episode a couple of months ago or I guess shortly after the elkhorn game was cancelled and they got to talking and put Sam's on the phone with Scott process and those that previously because you know but then when you see after so close geographically\nDown here right and the whole thing just kind of went from there and you know they got the eighties involved in that worked at a deal and you know shoot if if someone would pay me an eight hundred thousand I think I'd go anywhere in the\nHum yea me too and if I had a hundred grand I'd I Would pay you to go somewhere just you know in the spirit of diversity intolerance sound like you know here's one thing I'm looking at is that up here a lot of people they keep talking about boy to bad the band won't be here\nCook was not bad football team and there is such a wealth of talent down there ah that that these I don't think this is a a team that teams need to just be writing off [noise]\nNo I mean but then then the one thing and and that's exactly what Scott Ross wants Scott cross the up and he and vision you often she ran at\nAh UCF is exactly the cook runs and that's what the players\nYou know you know the Florida players that play risk which is Florida's always known well that's what Scott Frost wants and what do you eventually it's going to have in Nebraska you know even he looked at Scott Frost when he was at UCLA Adrian killings you set the you know who sets of all on fire with prosthesis yeah he's from me I mean he's from\nThe high school that is a stone's throw from the ... and that's just the kind of players\nUm that that Scott crossed one so yeah I mean but the cup and does that players that speed you know the players from Miami in Georgia you know junior college trash person\nLike that so now I mean it's not a team that you can take lightly that being said\nI'm a tune in my opinion is in a bit of a down year right now in their foreign born coming off a conference last to North Carolina and she just kind of give you some perspective\nAnd then that's where to recall one uh graduated from obviously to have gone the bears now so I'm so they just lots of them at the end they needed to be in order to be in a conference race so kind of a down your carpet soon but yeah I mean as far as players go um they have teams speed\nAnd uh you know they they hung twenty nine points on Florida Atlantic a few weeks ago so they can score\n... a good well I mean we look forward to a great game here but I've also heard stories from both teams that they're kind of looking to play a lot of guys that normally wouldn't play just to get a look at him to get them into a a big game environment are you hearing the same thing down there\nWell I think you got to read between the lines you're there you know they're not going to come out and tell you but you talk to some people find a scene in the kind of\nDo a little dig and then yeah that's exactly I think ... gonna do number one but their quarterback keep us Williams they don't even know if he's going to play he heard me last week against ... tea and didn't finish the game and soon a had their first practice yesterday and he did not practice\nAnd he said to be a game time decision I'm not even sure if he was healthy how much he was going to play anyway because again I mean but soon cook when they're still on a conference race and they still have three conference games after this and this was obviously it's supposed to be there by week so\nI'm not sure how much they're going to put their players out there I I think the players who travel and the players who play will be mostly started how much they play and\nYou know Nebraska goes out there and hangs twenty eight on them and the first quarter which which very well could happen um I wouldn't be surprised to see some young quarterbacks get them look especially you know the red shirt will now you can play any of these guys and it doesn't matter um\nSo so I wouldn't be surprised if if you see a lot of young guys I'm sure process going to do the same thing I mean I don't think Scott's looking to embarrass anybody I run a score up I think it's going to go out there and probably\nPut up twenty or thirty five in the first half in and get his young guys and and\nThat's exactly what I imagine both teams are looking to do in this game we're\nTalking with Zach deem with the Daytona Beach journal here on the ... radio program I Want to turn to\nThe focus on something else here in Nebraska of course after it was announced that that Scott process going to come back home and coach uh in fact when he was coaching down there just in general people in Nebraska are really following UCF\nRooting for UCF I mean I watched I watched that game against all burning I screamed my lungs out it was such a great football game\nOr are people in that area of the country following anything going on up here in Nebraska right now not that you know not that we're saying hey rate but I mean it's certainly been a bizarre year but things are looking certainly good actor or last week but are people interested in how things go up here after his run down there\nPeople are interested in Scott Frost absolutely I mean yeah again Daytona Beach so close to use the ...\nIt's an hour you know an hour from it so there's a lotta UCF crowds over here a lot of all um I work with a bunch of him in the office I'm a gate or myself so I get the hell out of the times because they still call themselves the national champion this year\nAnd they should I I think that you know\nI I had a partner a buddy of mine who's I mean just unknowingly a national champion UCI pathologist so yeah\nA ton of UCS stand in this area Scott Frost fans I think everybody kind of knew about midway through\nLast year when you see apples on us run that they were probably started to appreciate Scott a little bit more knowing that it probably be gone pretty soon I'm and lo and behold it's exactly what happened so yeah people are following them up there and\nAnd and I think there was no ill will at him leaving whatsoever I think everybody wants to\nEverybody and I mean if you if you reduce yeah than you would love for Nebraska to be seven an hour right now I don't think\nIt's one of those things were oh UCF still undefeated and Scott struggling for asking now I think they would very much love to see Nebraska you know top in the country right now in seven and now so he has a big following down here and I'm pretty sure they have already built the statue overhead is\nA good well that's good because\nThat was an amazing season last year and I know that a lot of my football buddies up here they're following you see it again this year and\nA you know myself I Lived down there for for several years I've been following UCF since Dante colpepper so out yeah so I mean you know that's a great program and\nUh you know it it's a yeah I'm Glad to hear that did people up there I have an attachment like people are up here too so uh that's very cool All right are you coming up here for this game\nI Would love to come up here for the game if anything just because I Would love to go to
