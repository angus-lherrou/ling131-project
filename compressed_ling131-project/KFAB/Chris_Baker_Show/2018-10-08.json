thought you were in bed last night but you were on a killing spree really\nCould've sworn I went to bed like I remember last night I went to bed day uh the uh Houston Texans kicked a field goal but ended a football game with the stupid Dallas Cowboys and uh I remember thinking to myself you know football's become incredibly boring\nAnd then I think that uh I I turn off the TV you know laid there for a minute and\nHer my wife's nor a little bit which is always very comforting and then I went to sleep nope nope you were on a killing spree I don't know if you realize it or not you really uh you you are your hands are soaked in blood that's interesting I'm looking at my hands right now they're perfectly clean\nWell that's because ah well maybe you wash them uh after you kill those as I don't get it anyway a\nResidents of very small brass county they're owed twenty eight point one million dollars a part of a wrongful conviction a lawsuit a Nineteen eighty five it was rape and murder I mean just a horrible and heinous crime\nAnd uh they didn't they didn't do it uh they ended up\nServing a combined Seventy years in prison for the slaying of a sixty eight year old woman and then they were

really hard to\nTo say so uh anyway uh they um [noise] well they finally got out of prison and they sued\nOr engage county is now trying to figure out okay well we have a judgment a twenty eight point one million\nI don't know how we're going to pay that and I think it's a good question because you know should the tax payers pick up the tab I don't think so but then again at the same time or are you telling me you can't find twenty eight point one million in the budget to cut\nIn order to help these people because I don't see I'm torn on this\nBecause I don't think the tax payer of Nebraska

many years ago who was in the body repair business and one of the things he used to do is he would go by these totaled out cars\nAnd then he would take what ever is good left in the car and cut that part off\nYou know sell the rest of it is junk and then when he would find another car same kind of car that say had a front end that was in good shape and the rear was terrible and he would get another car or the rear was in great shape and affronted was terrible and he would just cut that apart and put them together and ...\nNot really it's actually dangerous so [laughter] and because there are people who who are in the car industry that will do that but they won't tell you I think right then there are other people who are are people of you know of high caliber and they're not going to hide you know this is what we did we\nWe took the front end of a really good car and the back into the same kind of car and we put them together and now you have like a Frankenstein car\nSo which I always ask my friend I said you know she had to do you want to put the front end of a Camaro in the back end of a fire bird together\nJust for the heck of it right I Would look at it hey what the but I mean they get really good at it cause medically they they look like brand spanking new cars is just that you find out later you know I'm trying to remember\n[noise]\nHow it was a friend oh a friend of mine had a wreck\nAnd he took his car into the body shop and the body shop guy came to him and said hey you know that this is two different cars right wow well I had no idea and that's when he and I both got a crash course in how to look at used cars to see if\nThey were cars that were kind of put back together out of different cars but that's not exactly how limousines are made but it's similar to how they're made so now you know there are people who are saying hey hang on a minute\nI don't know about this whole limo idea\nUh that's why now a lot of people they'll they take town cars and and ah Suburbans and things like that is a very long way to go\nSo anyway this limo this horrible wreck that you've been hearing about that happened over the weekend in New York state or twenty people were killed and they're now are saying hey this limo company this little company wasn't even supposed to be operating\nRight so here's another example of where government says oh yeah you need us to intervene and then they didn't do anything you know they they shook their finger like a wrestling referee at this company\nOr they're now speculating that the limo driver did not have the proper license to drive the vehicle uh I have a story in front of me also that this uh twenty person a party was supposed to be on a bus\nAnd the bus broke down so they sent this a rickety old limo and its place\nSo uh and now I'm reading where there were several text messages coming from people in a limo to their friends saying this thing's a piece of crap we can hear its banks it I mean they were they were complaining via text to their friends who weren't you know on this little jaunt\nAnd uh and and saying hey this thing is bad news ah so you know here's my by the way here's my respect a recommendation I'm not part of government so this is why this is a really good idea if you're ever in a limo car or something\nAnd it's too loud and you can hear each other which is was apparently the case here or you smell exhaust\nWhich has happened to me in the past\nStop the car get out\nI don't even waste any time don't even say to yourself well I guess we'll just wait you know we get to wherever we're going and then maybe we'll get a job or something like that no tell the guy pull over right now\nBecause if this thing is supposed to be a limos is supposed to be the creme de la CR him so to speak of transportation\nIf it's not working right get the heck out of it\nBad news I have more on this story and uh it's it's it's an ugly ugly ugly story um and this company wasn't even supposed to be an operation so it leads me to ask\nIf you're a limo company and you can't pass the inspections to do business then should your limos be impounded\n\nMary's over there shaking her head yes I don't know if I can actually ... boy I really torn on that idea anyway I Will give you some more of these details coming up on the radio program also are coming up a well we'll give you some
