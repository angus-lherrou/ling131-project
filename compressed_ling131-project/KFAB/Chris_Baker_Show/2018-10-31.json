in the big show should day a and one of the big things here in Omaha which I'm actually really glad to hear about a lot of crime stoppers\nA is offering a an enhanced five thousand dollar reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction\nOf opioid dealers I think this is fantastic and I'm gonna I'm not joking when I tell you this but when I go home tonight and I would recommend all your parents do this except for your parents or go to school with my kids are I'm going to go tell my kids how did you like to make an extra five grand a month\nOkay here's how you can do that you know a dealer at your school rat them out you don't have that you don't have to give you name all you got to do is give them the information you can remain anonymous five grand a kid could finance his college education if they wanted to\nWrite no it's not every kinda dope dealer but its opioids okay it's pain pills and things like that and those things are rampant\nIn fact some schools I don't want to mention any names but uh that is the drug of choice you know this I don't know parents realize this I'm sure most of you do but just in case\nA your kids are going through your medicine cabinet and looking for your old drugs\nI don't know if you know that but they are\nAnd all of us I think and in fact in the Baker house what we did a uh last year my wife and I my beautiful wife and I and I really did this just because I wanted to see her get up on a chair\nYeah see Josh I Am thinking\nUh we went through the medicine cabinet\nWe went through the medicine cabinet you looked for every single old pain pill\nEvery because I had knee surgery I had you know I don't I Can't remember what else I've done I've done all kinds of busted up my leg\nIn fact I tore up my knee right and so I so they don't me a big time on that and I just want to say it was awesome uh then I had surgery on my knees so they don't me up on that and may I just against say that was awesome\nUh but there were leftovers so we went through the medicine cabinet and when you really start going through your medicine cabinet it's almost like going through your own little history\nOh gosh I remember when I have my appendix out of that sort of a gun I forgot all about\nThis 'cause you're gonna find prescriptions from years ago or maybe I'm just a swab I don't know but it's certainly something that a lot of parents should try to do\nAnd so the wife and I did we went through we found all those old pain meds and then a one night over the weekend we should all of our kids over to spend a lot of their friend's house and we got hammered art I'm kidding I made that up\nBut uh this is what kids are doing right now they are going through their parents' medicine cabinet their grandparents medicine cabinet and they're looking for pain pills and then they take those pain pills either they take them themselves\nOr are they sell them at school so\nI I Love this idea Omaha crime stoppers are in Omaha police and other organizations have all gotten together and they put together the money to start giving out an enhanced five thousand dollar reward\nTo uh to help stem the flow of these dangerous drugs into our community and I applaud this I think it's fantastic I Love the fact that they're thinking outside of the box and I frankly would love to see this expanded to other crimes such as human smuggling\nAll right guys if you head into one of those love your longtime parlors for that massage [laughter]\nI Know there's not a lot of those places around here but I have noticed that they are popping up no pun intended and I don't know if these are legitimate massage parlors\nOr if there are these love your longtime places but gentleman I think what you should do is you should go conduct your own investigation that if you could power the evidence maybe we can get them to start giving it enhanced by grand reward for that\nThen you can take that down to the peppermint HIPAA I'm kidding I'm kidding joking I Love this idea and I'm I Am I'm going to tell my kids tonight okay here's the deal for every one of these guys that you know what your school that's selling these drugs you can get five grand up pop\nI got a guy going to college next year heck he could probably work off his tuition over the summer\nI think it's a great idea I applaud crimes diapers I applaud uh Omaha police department I applaud everybody involved because you know what sometimes the best way to make your community better is not buying a politician\nOkay uh sometimes it's throwing the money right at

Myers\nAnd first of all why do we need a new one\n[noise] well I think you need for three reasons one um we use I got elected aboard two thousand four and a since I got on the boy we had a just a dramatic space that you want a and third thing is I mean the two second things when I got on the board there was a constant um\nConversation going on without juvenile court judge is about the need for more judges to handle a ... court system\nAnd a third or is the issue that just got passed the state recently um eh will be seven well it'll be eleven twelve we've gotten merged and there'll be six Seventy and I say that because\nI'm for years with senator chambers in the legislature the cow juvenile court was advocating for another judge but Senate the chain was at the time had had an issue with some processes and things that were going on over the last couple of years he was finally convinced that we needed to judge because the longer we did have one it just made the situation worse days so\nThey gave us the six judge a then we're talking about giving us to seven and eight and we couldn't handle that at the time right now the six judge they gave us is in a small conference room there and also um we space issue I mentioned at the beginning we got a tremendous issue with uh\nThe staff of the public defender and the county attorney's office did we didn't have space ... so we needed to do something to respect to the building\nOr to make sure that we had this base a base on the agreement with the legislature and uh with that you know\nThe need was there and we had to go about the process of trying to make sure we addressed at me we had been talking about this for ten years as we begin the process of trying to recall my juvenile justice system matter of fact\nUm we talked about it at a site on forty second street we're talking about a deal Federal Reserve building\nThe ideal side would have been downtown but the opportunity never presented itself so when we had the opportunity here we've got approach back up a business um and a private funded us out of that about trying to make it happen so we that's when we started to move on it because the Space Needle nap to ...\nAnd a imminent domain come up and you know building Neal the owner he loves he loves his building he loves loves that building and uh the the plan is to as I see it or they want to tear the building down build a whole new building or how come the option of judge rehab in that building is not on the table\nYeah we we they went in there and looked at the bill will let me say first you know the county didn't take that that option lively one when we begin the process of looking at\nUm there were no tennis in the building that we know there was no water turned on so it wasn't as if we would take in a um an existing operating building going from there and we looked at that option\nUm the results came back that it would just was not an option to rehab that building plus there three build is connected there there's the always say building that we bought this joint building that are the dot com is invested Doug's ... technology commission\nThere's a wall this joint there between dot com and Mr Paris building\nWhen we were going the plans to build the court house that joint wall there's no way that we can make the first project happen without destroying is of the war started building so we had to get the bill from that point of view and so that's why the option\nI mean like I say we looked into it um there was no permanent occupancy in the building the water was on it was just by the time to uh get the bill for the public use so we went to every means to make sure we when disrupting anything to that degree but there was no way to avoid hitting his building so we had to go for him to\nDo you think ah that instead of going eminent domain route a lot of people I'm not a big fan of eminent domain\nMyself but I could just be a matter of him just maybe not here in the number that he likes yet\nI guess before but um\nI Can't speak for this I Know that he had a similar piece of property that was located around you and you see when they were building if I'm any went through the same process but this one hadn't come out as a matter of I don't want to put in his mouth but I'm sure any right number would always be the I mean right now\nI'm we're offering them doubled away before it\nReally well see now that was my building I I I'm gone [laughter] guys are we going that I'm going man I Am gone with that\nBig profit All right so let's get into public safety aspect or when I look at this uh I noticed that\nThat you're going from the current senator about a hundred and forty six a badge or to detain juveniles down to about forty six beds you why would you go from a hundred and forty six down to forty six well\nLet me I mentioned before that you know about ten years ago we started at the juvenile justice reform process and those can we started to because at one point in about two thousand five\nOr ... the number is actually one forty four in at the time we we're averaging I'm about two hundred and twenty kids I'm there that caused us to do some to do a study and to go about trying to reform at that point so since then\nWe uh when it phases we went from one forty four will be two hundred and twenty so be it that's when we may twenty so the staff security staff secure means you have people in there but there's not a contained environment so from that point now I really ... operating capacity is\nNinety six babies that went down because of requirements for the prison rape elimination which is called ... right now we have about ... range some Seventy to eighty keys in depends on what it is\nA missing a a law at the time he'll be eleven twelve that got merged into will be six Seventy a debt redefined how juvenile can be detained in Douglas County a juvenile uh cannot be placed in detention in spinal placement meaning when an adult goes their\nTheir final place needs to serve out time an adult to the juvenile you can't of Seventy five is okay is that we have in their twenty of them were there for really serious crimes India waiting to have the day in court to be transferred down east Omaha right remaining kids that are there are a waiting to go into some type of program\nAs a result of bill B. six eleven ... LB eleven twelve which was ... six Seventy a kid can no longer be detained a by ... uh in regards to harm to sell or because they don't have a final place when that law goes into effect of July Nineteen and makes you\nWere gonna leave lose probably about thirty kids right there if that if that was that happened today and from um the trans or we go out to kids getting arrested and the and the additional programming that we're doing I think we get that number usually because it's going to go down to forty five with the ability to expand up to sixty six\nSo okay we're going to oh here we go we got to play more political ads All right we'll come back and talk more with Chris Rogers Douglas County commissioner Christian radio program juvenile justice is on the plate here on the big show and we'll come back and have more with our guests are Chris Rogers Douglas County commissioner here on his radio eleven ten K.

and ah so let's see where are we on the big show today a we had some ... ... email we got that out of the way coming up in the shower an episode of aren't you glad you're not that guy and a Honduran hoard\nUp day but also need to get to\nUh some of this audio a Don Lemon you know we've been hearing all these uh pundits out there saying we've got to tone down the rhetoric we just\nGot to tone down the rhetoric\nAnd you know I get it that when you're a guy on TV you gotta have something to say what do these guys think about what they're saying and let me give you a great example so we're in a big discussion first she got Franco Cuomo who\nIs talking about all these all these bad white guys all these horrible white guys they're very dangerous\nAnd then Don Lemon does not just doubled down he quadruple down listen to this\nSo we have to stop demonizing people\nRight first married we stop demonizing people could point okay we're going to start or demonizing people All right All right so that's what we have to do such Don Lemon\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized ... up to the right\nNow good thing they stop demonizing people I'm Glad that they have real lives that they need to stop demonizing people refreshing yes thank you done that is fantastic alright here\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized like ... and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nOh yeah what do we do we got to have a white guy ban\nWhere we got to have a white guy travel ban maybe all white guys have to go through some type of ideological litmus test\nA show that a herd lemon will allow you to travel you see\nNow obviously the jerk main horrible person that would go shoot up a synagogue or some idiot jerk that decides sent fake pipe bombs to people those are anomalies but apparently\nAccording to a Don Lemon that we're gonna have to have some kind of watch list I find this kind of language\nAlarming and predictable I Believe I'm the guy that's been predicting this okay I've been the guy sounding the alarm here we go were demonized and all these white guys were demonizing conservatives where we're dehumanizing them show now by the way down lemons ah man is a white guy\nSo Don Lemon sleeps every night with a white guy I don't know what that guy's terrorize and and I really don't want to talk\nAbout it but Don Lemon is a very concerned that we don't have a white guy watch list and white guys are traveling apparently very scary here's some more from the great philosopher and the man who does not want to demonize people\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this\nIs white men\nYeah okay well thank you Thanks Don I like that so so I thought to myself okay maybe he's on to suffer maybe white guys are the great domestic terrorists so\nBut using CNN I did some research and well here's some notable terror attacks with fatalities on us soil since Nineteen eighty alright Nineteen Seventy eight through Nineteen Ninety five three people were killed and twenty three others were wounded\nBy a string of male bombings carried out by a white guy\nAnd a moon bat Ted Kaczynski type\nFebruary twenty six Nineteen Ninety three a bomb blows up\nIn the world Trade Center the first World Trade center

Obama let her out\nBecause she was sick she needed to get out of prison she was sick and then she got to present day she finally ...\nIt is now hopefully burning in hell I'm\nA but it took her a long time anyway so there that that would not be a white honky cracker Nineteen Ninety five ah Timothy McVeigh\nBlows up a bomb outside of the Murrah federal building so there's a white guy ah July of

for the big\nTest against Ohio State has ... by ... fit or good afternoon Sean Callahan hey good afternoon\nChris we talked a lot off into coaches today following practice\n... acting a very physical test from the Ohio State defense they play a lot of press man coverage similar to Michigan and we knew how we know outlook against Michigan about a month ago a they're expecting a very similar type of test with\nThe way Ohio State attacks than what pressures stunts with physical man demand covered so this will be a a true test to see maybe how much growth this team has made can\nThey handle a game on a stage like this or are they ready for it after a you know making some steps in the right direction the last couple of weeks yes\nI'm going to go ahead and answer that question yes I Believe they are ready for it I think this team is just come miles from where they were when they played Michigan\nAnd the kids can they get the momentum on op ed starting this with the ball and I I think for the deep that no one's expecting Nebraska's defense to completely slow down and shut hello how states often but can they generate enough stops to give Nebraska's chance and this game\nThink the ... will be able to move the ball and do some things but you know on the other side of the ball at the defense can't really settle and that's where this game was getting really how hard southern Nebraska's enforced Ohio State to pump the ball to the last two times they think about that for a minute\nUnbelievable stab 'em and speaking of unbelievable stats recruiting I Want to get this to Nebraska picked up another commit today their\nThird of the week um and there's a pretty good chance they'll get their fourth of the week tomorrow but Jay Jay even write the son of former Oscar great Toby writes ah one of the hardest sitting black shirts all time they say a committed in Nebraska today over UCLA lives in Arizona\nBut does it like in a way back for I Believe the Colorado game and made it official Oscar now tomorrow about one thirty wander\nRobin and the fire Truckee um who's dynamic skilled player as a running back receiver\nA score forty five touched the junior and he's going to do something very similar to this year as a savior I'm is going on now between the Glasgow Iowa State Alabama Kentucky and Purdue and bras is kind of women could be the leader in the clubhouse by most of us\nAre more the kind of how that plays out tomorrow but\nThat would give them Twenty one commit in their class they're going to take about thirty I'm so there are getting getting there but um there'll be a twenty five year I think before you like your eyes and they'll have a couple of spots probably open after December at the lookout for February at a later science\nJunk ... just for the Oscar buzz real quick Sean does Ohio State have a hole in it I mean all I keep hearing about is how deep they are and they've got so many great blue chip players NFL quality do they have a whole\nI think the whole earth or secondary Purdue expose that a little bit\nThey're not the traditional Ohio State secondary you know a couple of years ago people thought Ohio State at a secondary better than than I fell teams um and then you know their their past Russia step back a little bit they both got hurt and it's no longer playing he's going to be number one pick of the draft maybe never to pick\nSo they don't have him anymore that's made a difference I think what their defense um you know they're not often they're often the wind has not been able to consistently get them to push to lead J.K Dobbins their star running back who killed in the ... year ago\nYou know really break free like you did last year but I think some of that Chris has joined Haskins is not a running quarterback he likes to flow gotta NFL arm but you take away the threat of like ... gave them as a running quarterback or they get made\nDobbin hard job that much harder if defense is kind of conditions on and on him knowing that Haskins is not really looking to want it that often\nUh-huh All right I just want to know see I'm looking I'm looking for that stuff and you know what I don't know about you but\nI'm I won't even compare last year's husk or team to this year's Oscar team because to me it's just a different mentality you know do you\nMean the the the teams on the start and the fact that this team kept their their focus through all that and and still believe what was going on at the difference where last year you know it's pretty clear that a lot of guys checked out late last that\nI Love the bench the guy who's to finally said okay I think I smell the coffee\nTwo guys quit so that's a totally different mindset if you asked me so oh no doubt and their\nDiscipline guys behind the scenes and and those guys are playing or you know they think you guys the freshmen locker room if you're older guy that is not doing things right they pack up your locker they move to the freshman Walker\nAnd they're
