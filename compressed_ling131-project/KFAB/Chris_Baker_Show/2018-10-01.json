comes this big push for a new ordinance to regulate landlords tells me about well\nIt's my understanding that uh the time that the rate occurred the school buses were already lined up to haul people out of there and move them into homeless shelters [noise] before any inspections that even been done [noise]\nAnd you know we're we're not on a police state system we are on a a code system where we go by the Omaha city code right not at the whim of some uh administrators at the city but we go by the ordinances\nAnd we are a complaint based system and it's been that way longer than I've been around forever as far as I'm concerned um there was something in the newspaper about how ... had prevented the city from inspecting properties before complain had been filed\nAnd that is totally ridiculous I I don't know how we could prevent them from inspecting property but we are a complaint based system not a registration inspections system\nAnd uh I'm Sorry go ahead the issue is go back a long ways I'm back in two thousand three uh our association filed suit against the city because they were abuses of\nLandlords and and property owners at that time and the property owners had no right to an appeal [noise] well\nThis goes against the constitution and the bill of rights and so we filed suit in two thousand three and out of that uh we we got the right to an appeal uh we got the right to a question a code violation notice um [noise]\nAnd at that time the landlord was given a code violation notice by the inspector they had thirty days to fix everything if they everything wasn't fixed to the satisfaction of the inspectors and the the landlord received a three hundred and forty dollar\nUm fee it's called a fee but it was actually a penalty\nAnd the property owner had no power over whether the list can be satisfied to the satisfaction of the inspector so it was really kind of unfair to the property owner\nSo out of that we got some really helpful changes I'm providing due process and at a right to an appeal to the property owner [noise]\nThen along about two thousand ten eleven twelve we started getting a lot of complaints are from abusive practices of the code inspectors\nWe actually are hired a private investigator that followed up on a lot of these problems and there was one account of a woman or being a accosted for sexual favors to make her code inspection list go away\nThere was another whoa wait a minute you're saying that a property inspector told the woman or you want these things go way tell you what your shirt off or something along

F. ab market afternoon\nChris ... how are you my\n... I'm a real good and I'm Glad that you could take time to join us today of course for those that may not know mark Ryan a mark Ryan is an expert and hypnosis and training\nAnd uh does a amazing job and now by believe he relocated here in California and then you left California did you do to just get too crazy expensive for you\nKnow was it about the expensive it was about the politics and the weather and things like that so I Move on down to Phoenix\nArizona and I love it here I Love hearing people talk about the kind of politics and the things that I Want a germ\nOh good good good All right well let's just let's get into some stuff that I Want to hear about God I'm watching this girl testified this doctor Christians forward\nAnd I was taken aback by what seemed to be her child like a behavior I thought she talk like a kid uh I found it interesting that she's a doctor allegedly a PHD\nYou had she didn't know the definition of a pretty but actually basic words\nUm and I I don't know it just didn't seem right to me and then I noticed a a\nA several other people were commenting as well and so there's this idea that she may have been under hypnosis you are Mr hypnosis uh what were your observations\nYou know I got a lot of observations but I watch this alive and I'm so many things came up and I've got pages of notes but there's absolutely no doubt in my mind\nYou know a lot of times we talk about acting when people are act well she was just acting well yeah at ... at the method acting is hypnosis they use hypnosis and what they called deep trance identification\nGet great actors into roles and the thing is sometimes it's hard to get them out of the rules\nBut what she had going on there was definitely some training of I Know some body language experts that that teach people in the media they teach people how ... how to get across a certain message with their body language and she was thrown all the markers but the thing is they didn't have much time to get her\nReally good and proficient at that so she was real jerk yet it's always real obvious what she was doing\nGive me an example by what kind of body language or you saw that was something that would be used to make a point\nSo one of the things I like to teach by contrast so\nThere's a certain point where she's wearing the glasses and you can tell she's not a glassware now she may wear reading glasses and I've I've talked to other people that were glass all the time it like where we could tell obviously so\nPeople wear glasses could tell she wasn't a normal ... but they have certain glasses on her put it on her to get a certain look\nBut when the prosecutor from Arizona was asking her question at a certain point she flipped her glasses up like people do with reading glasses when they're looking at you like to see the reading the book and then you say something and they ... and she did that and boomers they change she was completely now she was being ...\nPatty believing that and that's part of your values system you don't want this guy in your your your family is associated with government agencies your family's associated with a abortion activist and abortion pill manufacturers\nAnd the Gulf on me that could get in over a million dollars there's a lot of motivation to move forward there's nothing saying no I shouldn't do this then hypnosis becomes real easy dust stage ship noses when you see people on stage\nAt that they're going up and they volunteered to go up on stage nobody forced them to go on stage there they got permission to be a ham and to go into ... big time tramp states so they're more apt and it's a lot easier to get that narrative going\nWe're talking with mark Ryan about hypnosis serves some believe\nDr Christine Ford was under hypnosis when she testified before the Senate Judiciary committee a mark it's do you believe and I know that I'm sure you've never talk to this woman I Know I never talked to this woman but if someone were to go and talk to her today that she would sound different\nYeah okay so here's the deal the first thing I started doing was looking for other narratives over on social media\nIs wiped clean see the thing is if if you're going to convince a bunch of people you better not have contrast because people have concerts and they can see her acting differently like she did when she threw her glasses up overhead set up straight and got in a different khaki type of a mode of all that's the real her there she is she just popped out\nBut if you go on social media you cannot find it it has been wiped clean their it's gone even her yearbooks how who how did she get the company to take down the yearbook photos this has to have had some kind of help with Google or other big companies to do this but if you saw the contrast\nAt least joined us by the time for hope and healing luncheon with Patrick Kennedy on October sixtieth register at the ... foundation dot org\nIt's the time of year when sports
