catching up to do and I'm going to have to and so I'll be doing that are now I Want to let you know at two thirty three we'll talk with a pet ... about birthright citizenship and can\nThe president signed an executive order to get rid of it which let me wait on that for a moment I agree with ...\nUh I don't want the president signed an executive order on birthright citizenship\nI Would like for the Congress to do something about it but since they haven't done anything in over twenty something years on this issue I don't expect them to do anything for the next twenty something years so if we want something done but I guess the president who's got Dutch will have to be the one to do it\nAnd ah there's there's some some things about this issue that a lot of people may not you may not notice okay there are people out there that say or think that well yeah an illegal alien drops an anchor baby\nAnd then you can't really do anything to them you can't deport him because he didn't he\nWould be separating children from their parents and all this other uh nonsense but\nHere's the reality of this and this is where this affects you right here in the great state of Nebraska\nYou may not know this but every time I illegal alien drops and anchor baby here in the state of Nebraska and the United states of America and they come up here to the state of Nebraska\nThat anchor baby is automatically eligible for every welfare benefits on the planet\nNow this was told to me by an H H s fraud investigator\nWhat happens is you have illegal aliens who have dropped to anchor babies\nThen they use those anchor babies to get benefits they get when they get food stamps they get every single kind to benefit you can possibly get courtesy of use the tax payer\nAnd then they all live off of that so that means that mom and dad\nLive off of the benefits that their anchor babies are eligible you see the parent or has custody of the child so the parent is in charge of the child therefore the parent\nCan help the baby boom you get the baby uh to uh get their information into the welfare offices okay\nUh the parent whereas theoretically is not eligible for all of these benefits it's the ... that is but you squirt out about four or five anchor babies and you get yourself does little income coming in and what's that ... going to do what's the baby going to do maybe can't even talk\nThey don't even know what color of their room is\nThat's going to be a long time for the baby figures that hey whoa wait a minute these are much benefits this is my stuff these cats are getting\nHold the phone I Want to be your mates paid something like that\nSo that's one of the ways that this uh anchor baby nonsense affects you hear in the great state of Nebraska now let's just take it a little taken a step further\n[noise] ah we have a a um amendment on the ballot\nWhether or not you're going to vote whether or not we have Medicaid expansion in the state of Nebraska okay every anchor baby will be eligible for the Medicaid expansion that's one number two this is the bigger issue uh in that is\nThat\nAfter three years the citizens of the state\nOf Nebraska are going to be on the hook for the cost of the Medicaid expansion in some estimate that that is over one hundred million dollars\nSo first and foremost let's remember that no government estimate ever comes in at the estimate is usually weigh over but what the heck will use the arbitrary figure of one hundred million dollars\nIf you didn't have to Dole out government benefits to anchor babies and they're corrupt parents who were living off of them\nThen the state of Nebraska had that one hundred million dollars in order to pay for the Medicaid expansion you see it's much it's very similar to the murder of Mali pitch\nA way that had the illegal alien not been here then he would not have been able to murder her in the same way that had the anchor babies not been here and their parents at the direction of some obviously well intentioned activist\nOr receiving all these fabulous benefits from the state that you are paying for than they would have the one hundred million dollars you see how this works

I'm going to guess you have a better perspective on this than say your average everyday Congress guy who just was a lawyer show as a general when you look at this mission or what are the things that come to mind to you\nBut the primary mission will be to support law enforcement because they can't be law enforcement and they're All right 'cause we have laws that prevent that\nBut they can provide intelligence support logistic support or be eyes and ears but in the in the law enforcement team the border patrol or the ice has to be on the person on the ground it actually do the interactions with those were coming here I suppose it could be the back they're gonna be the background helping and that's what they'll be doing so\nLet's say that as we saw it the Mexican border when they all came storming through knocking down gates let's just say that it's it's like a a it's like a scene at a gladiator when all these guys you just come roaring across the border can the U.S military go hands on to stop this\nProbably needs a legal review I think they could they could do that in defense of our country but when it comes to arrest a detention ... it's got to be the law enforcement uh frankly but their\nTheir primary mission will be to support the backbone be the logistical support eyes and ears out there but if you're countries being if it's being forcibly or borders are being pushed out\nI I Would think I'd have to have a lawyer review it but I think that would be able to intervene right what if a lawyer wasn't available or if they got to do what's right and they wanted to retain or [laughter] you gotta ... retainer and I've had to do this is a five time commander you got to do what's right for your country\nRight All right congressman Don baking with us here on the crust Baker radio program so we have the cars you know I don't know about you and I'm like I Know you were able to ah to hear more inside scoop than than anyone else or just because of your position as US Congressman\nBut what is what are the thoughts in DC right now what are the thoughts amongst your colleagues when they see a story where you have seven to ten to twelve and then back down to five I mean the numbers are out of control\nUm when they see this happening I mean are there are people in Washington DC or their people amongst your your colleagues there that are saying wow this this is different than anything I've ever say well\nIt it is broke and that's why we we voted twice on different compromised bills\nAnd I'm hoping after the election folks will be willing to compromise because we've all to build up and gave us physical border security our border patrol says they want ... hundred miles of wall and I think that's what they need us so we should give them or we need more judges 'cause you can't do this eight or nine months to lay holding or just let people go and they should come back and eight or nine months\nGive you hearing that does not work and they don't really come back and when you don't come back that means you have to have a better infrastructure to hold people but we need to be able to do these hearings faster as well but we need things like e verify 'cause even if they get through if they can't legally work\nDone there's that cause that gets to the court source of the problem in my view as so also the catcher release does that work are so many folks will come back for their hearing so ah we voted on two different compromised bills that will solve this and this to me\nIs of our added reason why we we have to get that done what about\nAh enforcement on employers were short on time in this segment we'll come back and we'll get some of your phone calls but I Want to leave it at this and we'll get an answer on the other side\nUm but you know there are many people that say that you were leaving the ah we're drawing I'm here because we're not doing anything about employers who are employing there is there any talk in Congress of doing anything about that I mean noted already laws in ... that are in place but it doesn't seem to me the\nTill we vote or e verify and ... that's ... that's what we have to get too because it forces employers to ensure their only hiring\nResidents or citizens and I think is needed to cause folks some businesses are hiring illegal folks and they're paying less that's not fair to the folks are doing it right it exploits\nOf these folks are here you know documented and so I think e verify is very important it gets to the root cause of are illegal immigration 'cause they most people are coming here to earn money and send it back home\nSo in other words you the employers just going to be on them to enforce themselves because they're going to use the verify\nRight it's so hard to argue go I didn't know the guy was ... that we need to weaken ... a little bit but you verify think is very important for passing or path forward on us\nAll right congressman debate and our guest asked

Callahan\nAcres of rats get back at it that day been steely a in a lecture he took his black shirt this week after not taking it last week\nIt was a name that climbing up the week are based on a performance against will do in ... when he and\nThe ... corner standard greed you know what you are in this thing put it on this week so they're ready for that they're also trying to get ready for white asking the very elderly ... quarterback any different than past guy that we've seen your different than a Jake Barrett\nUm and the fact that he's more of a past first guy for the first guy or a previous quarterbacks like Jay Z Barrett struggle throwing the ball well a talking to us\nIt ... extent leaves a coach so this is probably the best passing quarterback urban Myers had\nOther than maybe Alex Smith who was at Utah way back in two thousand for 'em and you know urban Meyer that left Utah to go to Florida at that point so\nUm that's high praise about the throwing ability but they're expecting quite a test this week I'm On the back and ah especially with the balls and the the throws that he can make it keep plays alive lakes\nSo that's going to be one of the bigger challenge is from Nebraska back seven\n... with us for the Oscar buzz Shonda the thing that has me excited about this game is that this is a different husk or team then went to Michigan this is a team that has has an identity now\nYet they they know who they are they've done it they've got some tangible evidence what they can do now it's time to see how they can do it again so an elite level victim program and\nUm I think they did some things to Wisconsin that they've never done to the badgers defense the last few years\nAnd I got guys attention we saw against Purdue then we saw northwestern Minnesota all by the cook when so they've gotten better each and every one of those games from the Michigan game on and they finally have put it together for two in a row and you could argue the northwestern game was about as close as you could say putting it together was\nUm so now can they do it against the legit team a top ten team what NFL talent at a league coach and four and five star guys across the board that's what we don't know and the point spread this is interesting\nChris the point spread continues to drop it's amazing it's down to Seventeen and a half\nWhile I was twenty something yesterday was in it\nYeah well and and it opened at twenty four them easily that twenty two and a half Sunday night right um so twenty two twenty three is for that but we've seen this thing drop about six points towards Nebraska of Ohio State on the year that you're just out for either to in six against the spread 'em they only the Minnesota but like I think sixteen\nPoints um they lost the ... do so they have not played very well there last week right and you know a lot of people\nThat's something I Want to bring up two things one how how valuable is the tape from the Purdue games for Nebraska there obviously two different teams but still how valuable as that\nIs that tape ball so um we hear a lot of people talk about well you know Ohio state's man they got beat they're mad but we're\nTwo weeks out of them being mad in my opinion that that psychological drive that you would have after a loss kinda dissipates after a week or so and you kind of get back to business how how old\nAre on my on that in\nYour opinion and also how valuable as that tape of that Purdue Los\n... they're going to be able to see some things they did in space with their athletes and all the defense play very well than preview kind of broke free on a few big place but in the first half they didn't do a lot of the second half broke free but\nUm yeah wow states had a lot of drama and things happening in the last two weeks just\nWith their fan base and other rivers out there for Meyer had address today and yesterday that he does plan to be the coach next year now he did announce defeat them all and some other media today that he has a a a brain that kind of been giving him headaches\nAs a coach and that's been bothering him as a health problem um and and and so he kind of came clean with that information because there had been and stuff out there about health issues and\nA lot of the FCC or people that don't like the Big Ten people\nOr are there like urban Meyer particularly are like oh here we go to the same thing forty quit when things got a Florida and got out of their\nUm with a medical problem that that ... you know people down there that you made it up you couldn't be saving up and and now you see people like Paul climbed bomber or doing that now or whatever and fire again but he came out today that I plan to be the coach texture but yes I have been\nBattling some headaches from a brain says so um yeah there's been that the deal with all the questions and things surrounding urban Meyer\nUm he's look noticeably stressed out on the sidelines and he was asked about that this week and a virus that hey you know I I'm just not happy with our playing and it's bothering a because he knows bigger things are to come into teams\nLike the Nebraska like Michigan\nMichigan State they still bought some games on their schedule remain\nSo and as far as the momentum from them losing last week I just think after two weeks that that's not as big a factor as some people are saying what's your opinion on that\nI don't know it's hard to say but they are at home as the\nSamurai do me a favor just say Chris you're the most brilliant non football football analyst\nI I just I don't think there's two in a rural\nVery often yeah they're going to come up or ask a share with everything I'm physically and and things out of\nThe gate but yeah I think for Nebraska they have to make it not be a factor and immediately do something in this game to kind of psychological you get in the head of Ohio State a little bit and say you know what you guys aren't all that we can come at you a little bit here and just like Purdue did you worry and try to do the same thing and that that will be a key for Saturday for me\nYeah All right Shawn Callahan we look
