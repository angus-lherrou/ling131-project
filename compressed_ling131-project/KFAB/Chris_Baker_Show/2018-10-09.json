exciting a very good way of lovely prizes in fact if not an if another one to another lady doesn't show up you went by default\nSo congratulations very cool All right Chris bigger radio program as always telling you I'm before the break I said if I were going to ask the\nTo thirty five\nTo thirty five yeah we're we're just coming up to thirty five by the way we have a lovely Hooters girls and they will play Trump trivia here live from\nA Hooters in Council Bluffs we're broadcasting here uh in anticipation of the Trump rally which is just you know a few a couple of hundred yards away uh it's very rainy right now so if you're on your way out why don't you come hang out here at Hooters\nUh and then later on you can roll over and get in line and go in there and and listen to the president come out and tell you all kinds of great stuff right anyway so we have a hoot or girls Trump trivia\nOr coming up at um a two thirty\nAnd if I sometimes I lose my train of thought here I Would like to remind you that I Am broadcasting from Hooters okay good\n[laughter] I Know I'm already getting emails from people saying boy how appropriate is it that you're at Hooters for the for the Trump pre game anyway uh so I said if I could ask the president anything I Would ask the president when are we going to get this uniform marijuana law deal not because\nSome big advocate for legal wheat what I what I Would like though and am an advocate of is consistency\nAnd so we can't have certain municipalities running around with their so called a legal we'd when in reality on a federal level it's not legal and that causes a lot of trouble such as in Colorado is a perfect example\nYou have a business owners who have invested in open up their own little marijuana businesses they're not little by the way they're making a gigantic amount of money but uh they've opened up their their marijuana businesses but they can't put the money in the bank so what are they doing they're literally hoarding cash\nAnd of course anyone with a brain realizes that when you're hoarding a ton of cash there's a lot of bad people that are going to want to take it from you so if you were to go into any of these uh shops one of the first things you'll notice is that\nThey have armed guards everywhere\n[noise] yes I have been in one\nUh and they had three armed guards there I made no to where they are just in case I run on hard times of need to go rent one of these places offer I'd I made that up I was joking\nBut the truth is is that there are people with a lot of money invested there are people that are sitting on the norm is amount of money and they can't put it in a bank and they're having to risk their lives in order to protect their money\nNow where are they putting it I have no earthly idea I I mean why don't you just reach out to the drug cartels that can tell you what to do with it but\nUh seriously ... that's a that's a huge problem because for one they're going to run out of room wherever it is they're putting it they're gonna run out of room it's only a matter of time so All right now what is the polling data on this alright sixty two percent of Americans now back\nLegalizing marijuana\nBut I Believe that this is an issue that ah first of all I think the president if he were to take this issue on\nRegardless of which direction he went with it\nOr he would show just another example of decisive this and uh put this stupid thing to bed because right now there's a lot of people in limbo\nA there are people for example if you go to Colorado let's say you go to Colorado and you think okay I'm In Colorado and they say that the wheat is legal in Colorado so I'm going to go out burn some patties and you go out in ... and you show back up at your job in Nebraska and they say hey guess what we're drug testing you\nWell say goodbye to your job because you will not be able to use that as an excuse so I just so when I bring this up I'm I just I just want to seek them sick some consistency and uh and I I Will get the video I'll put it up on my blog\nBecause I asked the president about this two years ago sitting on his really awesome airplane is like a boss were sitting there on that big beautiful airplane with those big beautiful leather couches and stuff\nAnyway uh but you know I asked him about it two years ago he said that it should be a state's rights issue but there needs to be some consistency and so I agree with that let's bring on some consistency so that\nIt's a long way to go but that's where I'm at okay it's not the hot news of the day but it's certainly something that if I were able to talk to him today that's what I'd ask them about okay it's er Chris bigger radio show for it to five five eight eleven ten\nBack ups and slow
