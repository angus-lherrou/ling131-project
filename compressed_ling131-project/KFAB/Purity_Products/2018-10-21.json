damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's\nIt puts a

continue to do the same ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nShe did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the

let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because\nShe was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur for its been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote a wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have

then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalin's Russia and the er the programs and the the the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth\nUm but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about it someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nOr paint me I'm a ... a portrait of of a young FDR\nNo actually I was a I pledge they always say it was

I mean we do\n[laughter] you know I mean is it they were just sitting in the news was old world well I mean there are ground where quarter\nMile down the road is of anger deal man you know they're on the some basic parcel of land I mean to say that this guy was wealthy in and had every single thing if if I were desired was under state um you know they get every anyone people at nothing\nSo um he was a you know it was all but that was out around was not establish student or\nSees all the way through school a he'd rather live off and go play football and so forth and uh it was a well hey here's what was that I Want to use but he was a hit on something and it was really a you know it was\nIt was something I didn't think anyone was there for the asking and his political where to start out with the loss of Maine and can help them to physicians and they blossom them being governor of new or by the people don't know what I was governor of New York that are they forgot or they're just not talking about it any\nMore or less you know he was ... main mainly just talked to him [laughter] over Roosevelt was born and Roosevelt maybe it'll Roosevelt by Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman got hit a change in a monitor grammar and part of life actually [laughter] no\nUm no I mean this is the evolution of his first\nCousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was the second or third cousin\nWas the second week of\nRight and and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about what\nBecause that was just not the way that he was raised with a that Roosevelt name that was done anything to find people ... if he was a drug narrowly a full on their special and like some\nOf those so if it a lot of things are with unsavory ban some self marrying his cousin on finding a\nNumber Teddy Roosevelt in ... it was awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York classic now he was he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have the um\n... I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy sock scene Kmart back in the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV reporter he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they will amongst us but they have no idea what the hell were about it's incredible really the ultra rich off during the training and people who just hit ... and they don't have any idea about us or what we do you know and sometimes I Wonder if they really want to but it's not the\nRight All right if he's the founder it was like they lived in the clouds but he had he not contracted polio uh he ... he may not have been well he may have been president but it's certainly changed the trajectory of his life that you would imagine it would but also his\nPolitics talk to me about how polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this was where I I gained a lot of a lot of respect but\nAh I was not necessarily enough the fan I'm not much socialist personal but you know when somebody comes down with instant pop relatives because we're all week and loses her head and they fight their way back using sure will um installing\n... bars over over the bed so they can use their arms and dragging your body will try and get themselves to walk every day the ... when that happened to him you know the our ways uh started to you know obviously you know we'll be non treatments came in and actually work\nEstablished to identify with people who are suffering and who are needy they lose a gigantic flights a humble pie actually change of life\nRight I mean he displayed ... you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had a hunch is Iran's but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had ... spelled out in front of the Roosevelt mansion and he would\nThey have some of these races and he would use crutches and he was just incredible but yet if you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg\nAnd fish oil does so many incredible things for our health one of the things basically the only major thing that fish oil does not do at least has not yet been clinically shown to do is to lower cholesterol and so obviously tens of millions of people are concerned about their cholesterol\nWe just we're bombarded by customers who said you got to do something to help us out with our cholesterol\nSo instead of selling them to different products we kind of did the simple thing and said you know what let's take these plants sterile that have been developed recently a new brand of plants they're all that we get from Europe with great clinical data to lower cholesterol by up to Fifteen Percent it as little as four weeks we took that\nIngredient and we combined it with our pharmaceutical grade fish oil added something called co enzyme Q. ten another critical heart new trend and we've got a triple action formula here like no other we call it the omega three super pill\nJesus let's break it down let's go through these different items one of the time omega threes all over the news big headlines major research articles why our fish oil so doggone hot these days\nWell Fifteen thousand published studies on the role of omega threes and human nutrition\nAnd it grows by the day just about every single dimension of our health is now shown to be positively impacted by omega threes basically everything but as I said cholesterol fish oil and not lower cholesterol\nBut it will manage triglycerides will support blood pressure it will help keep your veins flexible and functioning well it'll keep the blood flowing it's great to maintain a healthy heart rhythm\nFish oil is now being shown to have an incredible role in cognitive functioning we're talking about memory mood brain aging infant development sell to sell communication\nFocused fish oils will enhance or increase performance in the brain actually been shown to increase gray matter and it goes to work in only minutes\nWhen taken as a supplement new studies showing immediate benefits study showing long term cognitive benefits they're looking at fish oil and just about every area of health joined health weight management prostate health skin health\nThe list goes on and on the big issue for the average person out there in fact nine out of ten of you out there right now\nAre clinically deficient in E S face the essays are called essential fatty acids\nAnd the two most essential fatty acids are the two that are found in fish oil the H. A. N. E. P. A. that's the business and the fish oil purity is the fish oil products\nThree times more concentration of these two key fatty acid than standard fish oils these are called\nPharmaceutical grade fish oils meaning they're manufactured in one of only a handful of pharmaceuticals license facilities right out in Norway they make the best fish oil in the world Ninety percent concentrations\nCompletely pure know mercury issues no fish tastes no fish show there is nothing like that\nJust the incredible concentrated delivery system of the ... and ... and if you're deficient in those two key fatty acids there's a\nA long list of symptoms that you could suffer from the tea poor memory poor immunity certainly pour skin health dry skin obviously your cardiovascular health might be impaired you will and potentially have mood issues\nVery clear correlations now between mood problems and low blood levels of ... P. A. N. D. ha circulatory concerns all of these things are associated with low omega three blood levels most of us don't eat enough fish\nFish is really the only great source of these two compounds\nFish oil supplements Haitian has now become the biggest category in the vitamin business because of all the benefits all the clinically proven benefits of EPA in the ha purity has really taken a leading role because we feel we have the best product and now the best product combination\nWith other ingredients we've combined with fish oil deliver even better benefits for people\nWe're talking with Jesus in camp president a platonic development of purity products about an exciting new product available exclusively through purity products called the omega three super ...\nWe've got a special offered to the free bottle offer stay tuned we're going to be given up that phone number ... Jason let's get to ingredient number two because there's so many got three super pill does something that no other fish oil product can do it actually lowers cholesterol talk about these plants\nIt was explained how this works and why it's so important\nRight well I don't know anyone who is in concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one compound one ingredient\nThat stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical studies shown to lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol\nHDL the good cholesterol though obviously you don't want to lower HDL plants they're all only target LDL and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in his little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from\nFive to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level safely\nAnd naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all since the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to Staten\nStaten work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plan sterile work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called my seals into thinking that the plants their roles\nAre actually the cholesterol particles so that my steals pick up the plant sterile instead of the cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles instead sort of just get pass through your intestines in you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them\nThe point is if you're on that and you can take plants they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants their roles to deliver the benefits as shown in the studies\nThat something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that laws on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever shown any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow Jason let's talk about the third ingredient in the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all over the world tell us about co Q. ten and why it's valuable for our health what does what does it do\nWell co Q. ten is found in every single cell in your body if they're from the moment you're conceived until the moment you leave the earth unfortunately as you age\nYou lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten one word should come to mind pat\nEnergy you cannot make energy without co enzyme Q. ten ... is the critical\nPivotal energy component of every cell in your body Ninety five percent of all your energy is related to the amount of co enzyme Q. ten in your body without an adequate supply you become energy efficient you technically would have energy efficient cells\nSo co enzyme Q. ten delivers a whole Napoli of different benefits were putting in fifty milligrams a perfect dose for you to get every single day it's going to support healthy blood pressure it's great for your gums\nIf you're a person who has tender gums maybe when you floss or brush your teeth you noticed a little ... maybe a little bleeding could be a sign that you've got to co Q. deficiency coincide Q. ten supports immune function\nSupports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti accident in fact one of the most powerful anti accident\nEver discovered they're actually taking a look now at Cohen's on Q. ten and its role in exercise and muscle performance one other interesting no coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where\nOne study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled kept them as little as ten weeks or so\nWhen you use topical he's a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and so the three and one product we're talking about these three amazing ingredients extremely safe for a long term use for short term use in any dosage\nAnd I don't know if you saw that report the other day but basically half of Americans are taking one or more pharmaceutical drugs so I Know a lot of people out there listening already taking something they're thinking is this safe should I take it to my doctor\nThere may be no three safer ingredients than the three we're talking about today\nNow Jason as if the super ... wasn't enough with the co Q. ten for energy the plants generals for controlling cholesterol and the fish oil for just about everything else purity is putting together an offer you see people can't reviews tell me about this great double free offers you got going on right now today to get people started", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "21"}
