but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a ... year peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but\nBut I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um I tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is\nA former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but\nHe recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface of sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this\nLook if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots Howard by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we\nThat they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know ... it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is is developing you know I talk about how\nIt beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded\nTo be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah you know ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ...\nThey're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... it just putting it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seemed to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty five so yeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is let's use in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities and or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives\nWho's to say that that that average you know I used to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\n... are like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose the right ah yeah no but I talk\nAbout I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely senator and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile then people would like to think it cannot stand\nAll the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought

invitation and grateful there's so much great music from all the classical composers and then those people come up and go when you do in Star Wars again so he got a mix all of a right\nWe didn't do that and I think that's that's one of the great things that people don't necessarily always know about this is an orchestra is it's an incredibly personal Oregon there's sometimes we have the orchestra getting four different programs in a week\nIm program where our primary audience is early elementary school kids in the same week during a program working with our Hispanic community to celebrate Hispanic heritage month at the same time rehearsing for the opera which is the next week and doing a symphony rocks show all in the same seven days and that I think this is the gift\nThat it can bring to the numbers are quite staggering actually so when you think\nAbout the um Hudson's bay in fact it was just over a hundred and twenty thousand people every year and of course a number of those folks are in our culture but I Would say over thirty percent are now and we've got twenty five thousand dollar\nArea students to participate in education programs all the way from Michigan

the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying criticism multifaceted problem where one we're not getting enough vitamin\nD three in our system ... vitamin D three is responsible\nFor activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it surprised me because of medical school we learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phone we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story\nRight hand for the first\nTwenty some years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone\nThat should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D were from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy\nWas due to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading the study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of ships in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful you know you're young raise and and they're developing\nSkin cancer but then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went home it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength can you do three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down first it's kind of a quandary thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then at the lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nRolling from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt and your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat said this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of there's vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball muscle pain fibromyalgia\nI Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nSo of course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you tickets what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those of you who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically so it's kind of like feeling a little bit younger Chris\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses the you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nWell one of the surprising one would I gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred for one three six seven seven nine\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr

done that so this is now the best of both worlds but we didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've added vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the amount of ... sixty seven percent so this now becomes the finest omega three nutrients in the world as far as I'm concerned\nThis is very very exciting this cruel oil sensation I mean it is all over the news
