{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "There was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that you use for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese\nBut they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nOh they're aligned mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\n[noise] but that's that's that's\nOne of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is\nResearch done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional self\nRight and have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being said just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's astral into ... dot org and there are great resources on their uh\nUm I I found specifically ways that you can take yourself into and it will be in there and you want to go through to do that there

with people that their loved ones that um can you help them with answer\nWell you can definitely contact loved ones uh it depends on whether each individual is open to whatever information you want to share but we have the ability to contact\nOur loved ones face to face\nYeah amazing experience that is incredible and\nAnd we don't need a medium to do it [noise] that ... every medium we'll give you

com and sign up\nThe onset uh Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis I'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices\nAre footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone and that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your closed ... at night and you can begin to see you are already in the\nProcess of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body you're\nHaving it doesn't mean you've exodus your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at a for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is\nI find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nThat event on because then I'm tired I Will switch and I think his muscles are you saying that now the money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is\nWhat I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is ... we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLosing ... image\nYou're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experience\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream again or\nThey may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc it temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what\nThis multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people are only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it\nAnd you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell that makes you wanted to ask the question like how did you hear in their ... year would you go into and it'll be an arms that question and have you ever tried dead and I'm curious how can you give me an imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience or okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in\nThese experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nMean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us\nOr we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just the download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present and when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get\nYour own verification oh what's going on and I think this is very important because no one's telling you\nDo for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's this is not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you know\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say\nEducational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody that's an avid believer and anything left backed up special your religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see\nWhat's real and look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this\nAnd it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of ... ... ... ... years old and he put ... recount Canton and it's often heated experience happened over and over again but he declines during early teeny here why do you think that is really get that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest just a sec says something to do with it\nEverybody including ... yeah refocusing\nTheir attention on their um let's just say their biological urges so mhm\nBut children or I I have an entire chapter devoted to this is my second book\nAbout children's out of body experience I have received thousands of letters from over the decades from parents who share their experiences with about their children unfortunately\nI'm In our society sometimes these or misinterpreted and you know they they end up taking their child to a psychologist or psychiatrist because it's out of there out of the\nNorm for our family to deal with so they end up giving the child Ritalin or something else to calm them down or whatever or it's\nUnfortunate because there it's just natural you know ... or ... you know what's funny is that Ninety over Ninety percent of Americans believe that there is an afterlife\nThat we are non physical spiritual being in other words and if we are as most people believe them why would we be locked into a biological\nMachine for our entire life Web when that's not what we are we we have a natural ability to explore beyond\nTheir physical limits the Buddhist sub known this forever that's why they train young Buddhist boys at a very young age to begin their training and meditation because they're more open to having profound spiritual or multi dimensional experiences when they're young right\nRight and you know\nWe don't receive dot com we've been trained to be a very materialistic from birth so that has a tendency we have to overcome that conditioning that most of us have every\nAnd tissues of your body you get the vitamins and minerals to fight uh nutrients\nThat we missed
