I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail and then he is kind of you if you can test and said yep was really sorry about that then you let go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get the best and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nIs that right ... ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for that believe all the things you're told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know go O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bump like that or is it just is like a it's\nA I mean I realize that they always kind of get

can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist and not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their host or too cold tourist and throw happens their biggest one is October which\nWill never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the states is open and I I Would never guess shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but but other than what the realizing is there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now is certainly open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round at film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know behavior or to or how they want tourists to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like to be around that time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting over Iran and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on\nThem and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts but that there's there's on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not in front of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start hitting the train

crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs ... allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime\nBefore a death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric\nThe focus on the acts of the killer or satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice\nAnd on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham\nAnd not run for your life\n[noise] ah all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell\nAnd the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalist need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experiences on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things have ever happened not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was against verse she'd have old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up\nPeople who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victim centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and I keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on coast to coast am this is Ian ... [noise]\n... whole body which is kind of harsh I've had I lodged condition is also a killer\nHow just how to stop talking out of it was just incredible set on the show before you can rent my when I have the auditor and two months later something amazing which don't taste while I actually have contracted\nA staggering it it's one thing that you can put a lot of soft [laughter]\nActually kind of weight my results I mean it kind of are caused [noise] excuse me [noise] well I\nThink that works beautifully owner\nRichard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has hailed this gentleman's hard perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit\nC.

the show was going to happen because of the world series\nAnd and now I'm I mean I'm not rooting against the Dodgers but I'm Glad it happened that the globe didn't send you to Los Angeles to cover the series so you could be on with us tonight to talk about the men from the train\nBut thank you very much for having me on the I actually I work for the red Sox and I uh my son lives in ... lived in the LA area until about a few weeks ago and just move out he was still there I'd be I'd be in LA or with the world fair group but uh he moved out so I I didn't go\nOh well gay and and I will tell you though it it did present a small problem regarding our interview tonight\nBecause I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't be on with us so I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series I I packed the book\nIn my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to\nK state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the two of them on so I Move into Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors\nAnd yet I wind up in Manhattan I Know very well and they were\nGoing to you oh totally cool so that so I packed the book and then I got the call like four days later on always good to go like\nUh the book isn't on the head of the overnight me a book so and I had it in my hand but unfortunately loves them and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax than I Do not want to miss with this true story of the the ah the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nCarter is my daughter read daughter my daughter she she's a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out\nI didn't really say that and I worked\nOut well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say a great book obviously desserts all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case\nIs very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to\nCongratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would add to capitalize on it I Would have been torture to keep all the way I have to be going well over here [noise] ah\n[noise] but you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last the last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] oh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the ... along with hundreds of other crimes are going to book I wrote\nMaybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or what I did um [noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an interest in the box and stronger case and publish some theories about it which might be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I mean I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the men's on the train is a story it is it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\nNow you see there's a youth molecule on the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nIt's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. A. it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smoothing skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an inch space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluids\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's in molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at a laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's gotta be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... about ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening\nIn our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells that connect all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose\nThe substance the scaffolding that the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking\nFor a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose it we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ...\nGas it well it took Thirteen Years for all the costs of me it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are gonna take this to the doctors and pointed out\nAs they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts with patients and people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these youthful levels of ha restored in their body\nNow you've written a great deal about the role of highly ironic acid in the bodies connective tissue sound as each a work in the joints and the connective tissue\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surrounds the nerves there's a sigh addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve all of these\nAre going to need a special cushioning that ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you\nIt work miracles for him why because purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called Hydrox that's taken from all as a pat you notice\nYou can put a bowl of olives on your table in a year later come back and except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there they didn't shrivel up and waste away do the fungal contamination so\nThere's something very strong and olives we've known it for a long time\nDr Roberta Korea an Italian researcher who is now here in this country doing some research on hide Roxy tier is all\nExtracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules do that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so we began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives\nInto ... new ha joined for a meal you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill of rights to us this year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nYou see this is the kind of thing we hear and of course there is founded with this\nThey just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a doctor ... saying he looks like a man that's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe his level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula and of course he sent us pictures on the Internet\nHow fit he looks for his age and you're going to look a little younger because when you were young you had a lot of this now this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean and it's all safe all natural its purity H A joint formula and pat\nMost of the people who write to me or call me or not people who regularly fall for you might say radio commercials
