what is this this\nIs weird but then I realized that I'd run out of ... formula and I went off of it for several weeks and I'm the minute I started going on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it\nThat's how you know something's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best tests that anyone can listen

monthly subscription programs as as a one time order folks so the number to call is one eight hundred for one three\nSix seven seven nine I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred for one three\nSix seven seven nine\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying criticism multifaceted problem where one\nWe're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ... vitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it surprises me because in medical school we learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phones we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first twenty some years I practice I never\nDescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies that just show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone\nThat should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D were from the U.S navy okay\nSo I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading the study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the decks of ships in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing\nSkin cancer but then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers inside and I went home it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength can you do three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then at the lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt and your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of this vitamin D three of my formula\nSo if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain ball and pain muscle pain fibromyalgia\nI Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear and is that the best way to get it into your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you'd take it to what your body absorb\nOne I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those of you who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger Chris\nAnd who wouldn't want that way and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and as blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred for one three six seven seven nine\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results and by

but we didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've added some vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the amount of ... sixty seven percent so this now becomes
