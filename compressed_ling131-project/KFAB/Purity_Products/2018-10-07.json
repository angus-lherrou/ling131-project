talking about the origins and Halloween\nAnd uh oriented time we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes tiny stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think he has he didn't like and you know it works with the will of saline theme um goes tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's deep darkness and said panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grabs her ... somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's if for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause you can because of its roots with with with pagan ritual but\nYou know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if you drink when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the famous paid hear what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nUm and and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA seating and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at exit is twenty two Eighteen you know ... not suffer which to live\nUm and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is fine uh and this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously comes up every every year\nSo it's coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing\nIn the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons I'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a\nWhere'd you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so so concerned\nThat using the ... board was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever I I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rules you know sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern\nIs uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing\nFor Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... that a kid the dresses up as a witch or goal will become interested\nIn witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party\nSo they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from Holly and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know the parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up\nPrincesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and ah\nAh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations that ... W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nIt came to Christmas and just the way it was right down the marathon\nBar on either right away I Am doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great oh I'm taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grab that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written or something yeah\nAnd the real or on the back oh man I Googled afterward on here and uh\nAnd uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nNever ... all the producers were were watching that cell or say hey you guys are going on the air now\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff\nAnd now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street that nobody ... the abandoned homes or\nA ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the energy board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you have written quite a few books actually\nAnd you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I despise writing that's why I like to talk\nOf her life I'll just say that all admit that I liked\nYour let your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences of now I find I found it interesting that you had said to me\nUh that uh people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would go ... why would you want to talk to a stranger\nYou know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know and that's true why do you now\nKnow that was that was ... when things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those it's basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the good um ranging from basically pre history\nA but primarily through the the the Victorian era up and up at today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find that the the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know you're leaving Macbeth I mean banquet so there's there's there there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history\nBut you know typically go or or if it's typically if if you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for reasons for example you'd be talking to 'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently hum and the the idea that somebody would\nTremendous effects on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of co factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it need sink and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it\nFor getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it or taking the wrong preparation can learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and\nSecondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil so what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't pocket on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish will\nNot let me ask you a question here because I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case vitamin D can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just going to read off\nA list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek\nOr Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D\nLondon time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk I Am a news that's American Medical association or listen to this that vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem sets the American Medical Association the you know it's just truly amazing the reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure health\nHealth all these different things as because vitamin D pet it's not a vitamin it is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ... it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight\nAnd what's eventually made is a steroid hormone now steroids hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid on and the way they work that is the key there are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it unlocks two thousand gene\nIs the key that two thousand one tenth of your genome by the when one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it and the only thing that can unlock it is vitamin D that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your\nBody knows what it needs it just needs the key one lock the right gene\nNow Dr you say we need five thousand I use pretty now here's here's the problem I went through the the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering your I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out in the the noontime sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know these the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way with purity products why the importance of this five thousand number was that the magic bullet\nYeah because of the single fact and this that changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime\nAnd ... for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now that's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much\nAnd then the that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to the ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefits\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering the test the problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right then you have to go and have the blood test done\nAnd then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way out of their symptoms I could look for that when you tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week ... talking about vitamin D is effect on athletic performance\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient\nWon't have any way of knowing it because they'd been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think\nAnd then we move is normal yeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\nWell more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient of course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nAnd about half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking the ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and\nIf you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nLet me ask you this when when people start supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference and they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\nYeah that probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by wellbeing I just mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month to month to month where you you know you get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low and and that's one of the first thing that\nAnd the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move are very similar to the close we had for heart healthy you're going to talk about that later but but people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mood to hire you live closer to the sun so the higher the altitude you live at the better your mood\nAnd mood improved in the summertime\nMood improved in the summertime and worsens in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this type in the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found they found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven times eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold ... at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave a about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life\nTo make you feel a difference when they start to supplement Robert Lewis takes about a month I let me let me get this special offer because I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you've got the vitamin D the recommended dosage the five thousand I use per day\nYou've also asked them to combine it with their omega three fish oils and there's a reason for that I Want you to explain that the synergy you get and they seemed to make each other even work better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good how are you paying for shipping and the shipping deals pretty good\n[noise] yeah when I approached purity I said you know vitamin D needs again at the special form of vitamin K the expensive for vitamin K to it needs to ... and I wanted to beat the patented bore on and it needs magnesium and it needs think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Omaha", "day": "07"}
