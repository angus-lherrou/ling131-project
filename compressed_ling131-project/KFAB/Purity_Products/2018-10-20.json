our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying criticism multifaceted problem where one for not getting enough\nVitamin D three in our system ... vitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nReally long list and I honestly it surprises me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phones we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first twenty some years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands\nThe study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show the vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea\nIt's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nCan you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D or from the U.S navy okay\nSo I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading in the study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah it makes sense you know people are out on the decks of shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers on inside and out all night it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down for us it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then at the lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially here in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurting your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that sets this setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three and my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain\nFibromyalgia I Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear and is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take it to what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast smell the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those of you who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger Christ\nAnd who wouldn't want that right and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results are basing\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol
