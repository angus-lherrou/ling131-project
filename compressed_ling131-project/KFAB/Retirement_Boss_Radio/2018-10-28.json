breeds a tend to Fifteen miles per hour but those wins will die down as we head into the evening temperatures in the middle fifties by lunchtime topping out in the middle and upper sixties about sixty five sixty Seventy degrees across the Omaha metro with laws most accurate forecast\nThe Social Security software and presto outcomes if you take early to maximize not always waiting the very longest will you maximize your Social Security\nBut it's eleven page it poured it has it's pretty cool it gives 'em um and gives a graph it shows break even points or whether it's um you're married you're single you're divorced or widowed all of those different things are worse than the report which we offer at no charge to the folks that want that\nGreat I mean I ... and and you also factor in if there's if there's a couple you also factor in the difference in ages and and how those\nTo Social Security benefits because right who a fence exactly right it emerged if you will yeah yeah so how do we figured the the the benefits I mean how does that even begin to become you know I mean we all pay Social Security so how do we know\nWell Ninety four percent of all Americans have a Social Security benefit or when they get towards that retirement age sixty two over ... percent that's a lot\nYeah and the other six percent they they don't have a a a enough quarterly credits used to be called quarter personally called just credits okay the credits are when if you're in Thirteen hundred and twenty dollars [noise] you get one credit\nIf you have four credits in a year it's fifty two hundred and eighty dollars that's index of ... what they do is they figure up you're thirty five\nIndexed to inflation adjusted okay so suggested for inflation of what your salary or what your wage is for that year so what happens is they take your top thirty five years\nThey have a formula they figure out from there so the more you may in those years then what happens is the the higher that your Social Security benefit is if you don't work a full thirty five years then you get zeroes in those others years so I just talked to\nTalked to a couple and the and and the lady is is got a I think like three zero years left and she's thinking about quitting her work entirely she's able to work part time I said hey if you make above this year if you make above fifty or\nFifty two hundred and eighty dollars you'll get four quarterly credit so when you're feeling in a zero it's much bigger than let's say that her income was thirty five thousand and and then the next year she makes thirty eight thousand it might go up the teeny bit here you're replacing has zero through income and I said\nYou would like to work part time because you will certainly build up a a lot every year that you feel emphysema or so so there are certainly some strategy to Social Security are claiming and and we're fortunate because I Do have an expertise within that arena\nThat's great I alluded to this a bit of go about spousal benefits and you know that that claiming strategy\nTech tell me about that where is the benefit there\nFrom a basic standpoint if you have a husband in a wife and I'm just hypothetically say in this let's say that the husband's got a um a two thousand dollars Social Security benefits\nAnd the wife certainly didn't work but but then she took some time off for kids with happens a lot in this era and let's say or benefit is eight hundred\nWhen she goes in in claims if they both claim let's say that that's up there full retirement age sixty six what happens is\nHe will get a two thousand dollar benefit 'cause that's his primary benefit but the spouse can take all of hers\nOr half of his whichever is higher to claim yeah he's a claim to do this but what happens is if she's getting eight hundred and then it has benefits two thousand half of two thousand two thousand she gets a top up of two hundred dollars even if she never did work\nAnd she has no benefit you're still entitled to half of that stuff but she still would get a thousand as long as he's claiming so knowing how to work that spouse will benefit in your favor can make a big difference down the road ... what's your total value of Social Security lifetime is absolutely\nWell they tell you what why don't we open up our phone lines lessons like folks to give us a call come in and get that Social

out of\nTime and place where all your money for you\nCalling your local wealth financial\nShape for open an eight eight eight and nine seven five eight eighty nine seven five Seventy seven [noise]\nBack consumer advocates seems that oh this is retiring the boss radio where you take charge of their money and to give us a hand of course we call on day ... Davis financial advisor for Calvin and associates about thirty plus years in the business end up serving a Nebraska that your area for pretty much that old time right\n[noise] yeah you know what it's it's fun to be in this business started I'm actually in Nineteen eighty one of the first couple three years and insurance and then I got into securities\nBut but helping people with financial matters helping people with a good investment choices helping people with Social Security is here in retirement planning in general\nThat's what I Do and I'm In my my focus has around really kind of pre retired\nAnd just retired a person where there's a lot of decisions\nThat are being made but one of the key decisions is for you to take charge of your money is important and we help you do that absolutely\nSo we've been talking about Social Security and and ah well we'll we'll kind of dig back into it and uh one of the areas that um that's also scaring one we talked about the uh the cost of living\nThe cola benefit a ... percent this year I'm so now I'm let's talk about income for survivors and again not a not an area we want it's not a pleasant thing to talk about but it happens [noise]\nNo that's exactly what you don't want the guaranteed things that will happen in our life is we're guaranteed physically to pass away I mean we're not going to live in a hundred and fifty a hundred years of age it just doesn't happen in so so what happens here is is that income for survivors this really goes back to why so scared was set up\nA under Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Nineteen thirty five for benefit paid out in Nineteen forty what happens is is there was you know so many people are there was a lot of single women weather in the ... most of it was not divorced but it certainly was\nFrom from from surviving their husband and you know over fifty percent\nWere where were you know destitute they they didn't have the money they they were they were considered very poor and this was really a help\nTo them down the road to have some kind of guaranteed income from the government's Social Security is right to to to help them not not to pay for all their bills with to be a supplement so what happens is is that\nIncome for survivors\nThinking that it gets complicated but in just simple terms what happens is is that let's say again that uh in today's day and time that the man was making two thousand for Social Security the woman was making eight hundred that the man that passes that wife can jump up\nCommitted this terrible act I asked again that if you have information that may help please contact long push FBI\nSpecial agent Robert Jones for mass shootings to mail bombs in Fox exclusive homeland security secretary cures to Nielsen said these actions cannot be tolerated she says\nPeople using free speech is a shield to hurt people is\nNot America you also violent called disruption are not affected not productive and frankly they can any hot dish and all I ... accent of our ability to work together boxers ... this is Fox News [noise]\n\nLook I hear all the other commercials on their confidence eulogy for St Thomas's financial plan for you we have something in common with armor planning than have\nTo be complicated take advantage of our luggage and make sure that your retirement plan really in the line with your own minimum on coal your local will money annually in some coach named them for a moment of those\nNine seven five eight eight eight nine seven five to six seven seven [noise]\n\nUnwelcome in we are back on consumer advocates Steve's at all and this is retirement boss radio where you take charge of your money and with me in Studio of course they've been very is financial advisor it helping and associates a Dave how are you good to talk to you again a force\nDoing very good Steve are you doing\nYou know very well and um so you know you're talking about things that you want to avoid and retired but I mean it seems like there's a lot of things that we that we want to do but again there are some potential pitfalls out there too that we should probably steer clear of you then\nYeah you know let's see what happens is is that there's bull markets and there's Barrett markets bull markets is when the markets are up um corrections normally are when the market is a ten percent down across the board or their market is what is down more than twenty percent and we have not had a twenty percent decline in the stock market\nFor over nine and a half years and that that makes it\nOne of the longest if not the longest in modern history well markets ever so you know what happens in the markets it it doesn't always go up up up up up there are corrections there eventually are better markets and of course this is something that you have to keep in\nHave to keep the back of your mind because we're we're we're we're getting along in a to Z on this bull market right now\nSo let me ask you this so between the ... you know we talk about the bull market and how long is has there ever I mean what's the longest bear market is that is that something that we should be worried about\nYeah you know what happens though bull markets are almost always longer than barrel Marcus if you go back to the bear market it two thousand ah two thousand eight which really started in October of two thousand seven okay and it ended in March the ninth of two thousand and nine so there's basically I'm I'm\nA ... the Seventeen are so months there ... uh the bull market lasted for five five and a half years of bear market than lasted for about Seventeen months so bear markets are kind of fast and furious\nAnd out of the decline bull markets normally take a ... a a a longer time period to go in and to make that happen\nWell good luck [laughter] let's hope for the short merit alone ball right yeah you're right you're right so what else\nDo we need to worry about it I mean in terms of you know uh being being cognizant of what you know what the bull market versus berry market and then what else can we do to sort of you know pat against that\nSure I think he got it when you get\nKind of pre retired or at that retirement age are in retirement\nThere's no doubt that that you're looking at not having that steady stream of wage or income ... of those ... W E a two income or if you're self employed tens of income coming in because you are going to retire or your retired so what happens I think that you you start\nAt you should have more of a concern about ... tech ... yourself\nFrom big losses and that's that's tough I mean you can do it a lot of different ways but what happens in in our business is we're we're really more concerned about not losing big money than making big money but\nNo that makes sense absolutely yeah\nYeah because the recovery from losses is tough and I always say that that people you know if if if it if if you give me a dollar and it's a great marketing and we're up that year fifty percent so a dollar goes to fifty cents\nYou're down fifty percent then I say hang in there market's gonna come back in the next year the market's up fifty percent so got a dollar down fifty percent the first year of fifty percent the second most people say well gosh you got your dollar back but if you do the math on it you don't\nYou have a dollar the markets down fifty percent now have fifty cents\nAnd now the market is up fifty percent fifty percent of fifty cents now you're Seventy five cents you're still down twenty five percent right so the market goes now fifty percent you have to gain a hundred percent the next year\nJust to break even yeah now I always say that that that law says controlling your losses\nIt's a mainstay of what you should do especially when you're getting towards are in those retirement year absolutely\nAnd then you know the bombs fit into this picture how I mean 'cause we always hear about ... and and the bond market and how it ... acts and react with the market\n[noise] yup bonds of course are loners ship you're loaning you're you're giving your money to a corporation or government I mean there's some ... some kind of institution and then they are going to give you an interest and if you hold that loan or or or that bond to maturity\nThen you get back your your principal that that the goal now what happens in the interim of that\nIf you had asked interest rate volatility hits it's it it it it goes in and it moves opposite of interest rate so all the bonds are considered\nLess volatile and stocks they still have their downsides in interest rates\nAre one of those so here's how it works if you buy a bond and let's say that it has a this is just hypothetically but it has a four percent\nA coupon and interest rates go up to ten year bond and you sell it in five years but interest rates have gone up in that time you'll get less than ... value for that bond you'll get less\nIs that what you put in if interest rates go down you would get more\nSo it has a fluctuation has a volatility primitive itself you hold it till maturity as long as they're solve it yeah then of course then you get your money back on that new issue bond but I think when people go in and say you know that that that quote\nA when you look at bonds versus stocks and you say how does it fit in my portfolio there's less volatility but that doesn't mean that there's no volatility if you go in and you sell in the interim of that bond holding\nPeriod it's kind of like a big teeter totter right like on the playground between on it as it goes on rights yeah goes opposites of in straight sets the yeah right yeah\nAnd then um where else do we have to worry about too you know taking care of our retirement making sure that we should avoid some things in in the process\nYou know we we talk a lot about an income plan because when you're when you're working the income plan is your work income\nI mean especially if you're married husband and wife both working you got good income coming in hopefully dead as being paid off in the kids are through school now when you get towards retirement age but what happens is is that\nNot every one but the majority of the people that I talked to income plays a a vital role in and I always I always talked about the five pillars of income five pillars so so what are those five pillars of income well you've got wages\nBecause that's a pillar okay I've got tensions okay I've got um um invest\nDouble assets\nOkay soaked into your you know we're retirement assets your brokerage assets your your savings accounts et cetera\nYou've got required minimum distributions I include this is an income source because it's Seventy and a half on your traditional retirement plans for one case I raise for three days four fifty seven governments all of those retiring plans you're forced to start taking money out at seven and a half\nFrom the U.S government so that that's an income source and then Social Security\nSo I have an expertise in in Social Security claiming of windows maximize that Social Security and and I'll say one thing about so scary I always say it's the most\nUm flexible of of all of your\nIncome streams I mean ... you could started as early at a at the age of sixty two at a discount or you could wait as late as Seventy\nAthletic keep growing taking the income but keep growing so they benefit gets bigger when you start taking it it's it's it's it's quite flexible compared to other income streams so it from an income plan is kind of figuring out when is the best time\nFor you to go in to not to just take your Social Security but what income sources should I take from one of the things\nThe that comes up a a lot with myself but people wouldn't think out on their own is they were just going to go ahead and take that Social Security earlier at a discount means they're not going to make as much but taking your earlier and they were going to go in and in in let their\nSay retirement monies go all the way until they're forced to take it out but remember if you look between the ages of sixty two and full retirement age\nYour your Social Security on an average grows between guaranteed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement Boss Radio", "city": "Omaha", "day": "28"}
