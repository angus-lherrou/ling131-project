standpoint I see probably is almost as many people at this age the game that's over ensure that under insured so so you want to buy what you really need you want to buy the protection of what you need not what you needed at the age of thirty five or forty\nBut at the age of sixty sixty ...\nThere's of age right okay well good I mean you know that whole thing that a whole and sure we can have a whole show about insurance and what what it is what avail yeah I'm not but again this one to me is that was one of the most important and that is\nTo make sure you take the emotion out of it I mean when you're dealing with whether it's an illness or whether it's a hurricane or or whatever it might be we are emotionally invested in can sometimes not make the best decisions\nYeah you don't want to make\nBig decisions um after a you know after a big emotional I'm kind of a misshapen big emotional event has happened and the reason for that is is is there is a left brain has the right brain the left brain is the more I'm I'm kind of calculating\nA mathematical the right brain as more of the emotional part of the brain and what happens is is that your decisions should be made from a factual standpoint\nAnd many times when when tough tough things have happened\nUm whether it be a death in the in the family say a spouse or a child or there's been um um um you know you're retiring or got you just got fired those are the call now if you're retiring and you've thought about it for a long time know you you pretty much kind of went in and\nAnd I understand what's happening but if something happens all of a sudden\nThen you probably don't want to make big decisions right after that if you can so so taking a motion you know in in in the stock market itself and I already said in in today's show but you know you can go back to economics one on one you make money\nBy buying loan selling high course but emotionally Steve people are ingrained\nTo buy Heinz so low when things are just pop in and everything's going great you're just going to get on that bandwagon but the train is almost pass the station and I'll go back to Warren Buffett again he's a value investor he's one of the probably one of the top professional investors ever\nIn in the world and what he does he has lots of cash on hand a lot of that emergency fund but what he does the he gobbled up companies and purchase companies no doubt\nWhen um the value is still there but the stock prices down social try not to pick decisions from an emotional stand when when you're kind of an emotional state\nRight now if we're dealing with these kinds of situations a tall to you would be the right thing to do\nYeah you know we get a referral calls we get a lot of calls that\nThat call into our office and they they they need help either with Social Security because I have an expertise there and and and and that extra nice to have just because the age that I'm working with three retired retired it certainly is the IRA roll\nOver or the four oh one K. rolled over um industry and you know and that's where the majority of the money for equity is in the household right now and you know what I mean it's it's\nIt's pretty gratifying to me but I look back over my thirty plus years at a sense that says that\nYou know mid eighties since I've been in the business what happens is pretty gratifying when I go back and look and say hey you know what I ever really help this person get from point a to point B and you know there's there's amount of risk\nThat a person takes and there's the amount of will reward that they're looking from their investment portfolio and then trying to to to make sure that those\nWere concurrently for the best interest of the client yeah I tell you what it's a it's a pretty gratifying business to be to help people like that\nRight well why don't we why don't we offer folks and opportunity to give us a call right now and and you know come on and on TALK about

seven\nIf you're of the mindset that if you could retire tomorrow you would the next segment is just for you when we come back some strategies that could help you found your retirement\n\nWe see it on the news every night many financial experts agree that the markets are overdue for a slowdown flows friction now when we hear the word correction it sounds pretty harmless doesn't blow\nTo be honest it's about it's harmless as when geologists say that an area is overdue for a those close again seismic shift\nNow in plain English that means earthquake in that direction that the markets are overdue more well no one actually knows what that means he'll it happened and that's why whether you're retired approaching retirement\nOr which is the real maybe you haven't even thought about it and now the time to get protection from that market volatility call your local wealth\nAngel and in some coach Dave temper of pulp and an associate eight eight eight nine seven five lost eight eight eight nine seven five to six or seven [noise]\nOn this is retiring legit boss radio where you take charge of your money will help you get there and with me to do just that is they ... a day that has been in this business a much better the thirty years' he's happy to tell you I'm he's also financial advisor a cult in an associate so Dave I'm yeah\nI Want to retire tomorrow can I Do it [laughter] how many times you get that question a you know what I'll\nI people say you know I really want to retire and the next year so I say you know what let's take a look at the whole broad picture you know kind of take a look and see where you're at Syria where you are with investments savings what your expenses are taking a look at what you got for emergency funds to take a look at what you for Social Security I mean there's a lot of stuff should end of this\nBut I Will say this is that\nYou know if if you can go in in in in in a chisel down cut down some of your annual spending\nYeah no doubt that is going to help you maybe go in and possibly retire earlier so so I think it's important when I ask people so what are your living expenses I shouldn't be surprised but it's it's pretty amazing that ... many many folks who I talked to\nThey really don't know what their monthly expenses are when it comes to living expenses and and you should 'cause they have to be met by income hopefully of more income\nAnd then what you do is you actually have discretionary income if you take your living expenses are you take of what your your net income coming in is if you've got money left over that discretionary it can be saved it can be invested it could pay down debt\nOr it could do something from a personal nature whether it be travel uh entertaining um house repair et cetera but but I think those two things are very very important and you know one of the things that that we still do\nWhen I'm In my sixties we still do my wife and I Amy\nI'm Will go at least a month to two months out of the year and I'll go through all of my personal check books and see where my money is going and ... and I'm always fairly amazed on just little things like shows in eating out\nAnd I'm telling you what\nQ. V. C. for my wife and Amazon Prime for day tipper\nGore do I buy things locally of course I Do it's just so simple I mean go through a couple of months go line line by line I Am I always say that you a check book but it's certainly your debit card your credit card cash would ever happens to be find out what you're sitting in how that compares\nThe and what kind of discretionary income yeah but I think that that report if you can cut some of those expenses down yeah you may be able to retire a a year or two earlier\nTalents on CBS his face the nation with Kevin on the court and the conservative majority in place both sides are looking to benefit of the ballot box of November GOP\nLeaders claimed this fight has helped close the enthusiasm gap among Republican voters but Democrats are trying to capitalize on the anti having a protest\nBy promising to launch further investigations into the allegations against the man who tenderly even in ... him thing retake the house Fox's guarantee any this is Fox News [noise]\nAnd we believe in better\nA better way to invest a better way to serve you and a better result we can help you determine how much risk you're taking red flags that could be potential problems for you\nHow much you're paying fees are commissions potential tax liability or even how to address Social Security poll your local wealth financial and income coach Dave's temper of cult in an associate\nEight eight eight nine seven five bar that's eight eight eight nine seven five to six seven seven [noise]\nEverybody welcome in on consumer advocates these at all and this is retirement boss radio where you take charge of your money and with me of course of the day temper stays\nA financial advisor for helping and associates so Dave how are you a nice to see if they get Steve are you doing yeah never better this is going to be an interesting segment I think in that the average American can expect to live into their eighties today\nHuh exactly right five percent of sixty five year old to go past the age of Ninety yeah we've got to do some planning\nI'm sixty three of my father passed away Thirteen Years ago but my mother Ninety five yeah we're big gun to brass advance and we set up a tailgate on for every home game and we had a surprise birthday party for my mother she was Ninety five years old\nAnd I mean incredible I mean she had a total new replacement last year she had other total knee replacement this year I mean that wouldn't have happened twenty thirty forty years old course not you know when when when Social Security started in Nineteen thirty five Social Security started paying out at the age of sixty five not early not later it was\nSixty five I was at ... exactly right and that was in the night that was in Nineteen thirty five\nNineteen thirty five yeah the actual first payment came in Nineteen forty one but it started in Nineteen thirty five and of course they had to fund it before they started paying it but the interesting thing is the Nineteen thirty five the average American lives to the age of sixty three\n[laughter] and you couldn't collect until sixty five\nSixty five that mass murder pretty darn good just to get on to go now\nLet me get started early uh sixty two was with which\nUh forty percent of the people start as early as a kid a fifty two very few people only three percent Steve wait until the age of Seventy so what happens is is that people are just living so much longer Social Security is this is such a great benefit\nFor folks today but back in in in Nineteen thirty five or Nineteen forty you know what you were lucky to live long enough just to get the benefit\nRight and that certainly obviously not the case of it because we are talking to people who get you know a hundred hundred and fifty two hundred thousand dollars just in Social Security over the time\nOh or or much more than that really more than that to him\nOh yeah I tell you what it is I just didn't want for a husband and wife and and I was thinking the husband would live to the age of eighty five and the wife to the age of Ninety even though they still have parents living and there are and they're just like fifty eight fifty nine years of age and it was a million dollar Social Security\nBenefit wow what a lot of amazing how cool is that did you get to do that for folks\n[noise] yeah yeah it's really great you know to try to maximize that give you know what you want you don't want to do you don't want to claim your Social Security here something three years down the road and say gosh if I were the only knew that he would have done something different learn beforehand we have a Social Security analysis it's ... it's it's an eleven page color graphs\nAnd there's excel spreadsheets on all of the uh uh money's outcomes and it certainly could benefit them in the long haul\nYeah absolutely so one of the keys I think is is a diversification right when it comes to ... you know just taking care of our our assets are portfolios right\nYeah that's right not just having diversification but having the proper asset allocation order on by that is\nLet's say that you have X Y Z stock mutual fund okay and then you've got a B C Stock mutual fund you got element of the stock mutual fund yeah you don't want your diversified\nAmongst fund families but they all kind of have that same investment type so if the if that stock market goes down ... most likely all of those will go down together asset allocation is when you have a either not\nMuch correlation or or kind of a negative correlation so if you have a stock and you have a bond portfolio bonds\nUm don't have a real high correlation to stocks or there's other non correlated types of investment so when I look at the core\nA investments that are available core their stocks\nThere's barns there's cash or cash equivalent really anything outside of that and we do our fair share of complementary investment business with those non correlated types and that's I think that that effort allocation is it is is very important and lastly on this subject\nYou know when you look at risk the type of risk that you want to take\nMany people when you look when actually dissect their portfolio in their four O. one K. or their IRA or their investment plan\nThere many times taking more risk than they thought I we we just had a lady that came from the radio show a call in and we had an appointment and actually it was the third appointment that we had and I was proposing but the point\nBefore I went through in twenty right at twenty percent effort portfolio was in a single bio pharmacy stock and get a load of this right now is trading for a hundred and fifty dollars a share hundred Seventy one was the high for the fifty to a guy\nForty to fifty two week low that means that there's the Seventy percent\nChange in value from high to low well when you're in you're when you're in your late fifties early sixties\nCan you afford to take that kind of risk most people can't really didn't understand the type of risk she's taken so then you start looking at what has\nLess or risk or maybe even a much more capital of um preservation so that's what we try to do is to really cut a dissect that rest and and let the person no\nYou know here's what could happen if they think oh my gosh that seems like a lot of ... lost it happened well then what happens is you start toning down that type of risk for that potential client\nMhm wow yeah and and again that that makes sense um what about managing the the accounts I mean we sort of touching on that a little bit but where does that how does that fit into all of that\nAnd are you talking about managing four O. one K. accounts okay\nYeah so let's say this let's\nI'm going to give it up now because it's the perfect thing I talked to another client and then and and again it was from the radio show came on and he's an engineer but what happens is he's got a couple of a guy called dormant for all and K ... or ... or ... yeah I mean he worked for other companies and they just left him there\nAnd he's being fairly aggressive which he is I mean it's a mindset is fairly aggressive\nBut what happens is is that\nI Want to know who's who's kind of watching\nThose four O. one K. investments I mean I mean are are you making rebalance things and are you making a judgment calls on the vastness or you're pretty much just letting it right\nWell I mean when I leave the company the company no longer really cares about your four one K. right off\nThe company does it but but the custodian the mutual fund you normally go to the custodian of that you can certainly call and make rebalance things but you don't what Steve\nBy far the majority that people don't know of course they just they just let it ride in probably one of the worst things you do is is taken emotional stance on it that means when the market has really really are going down\nAll of a sudden it gets lower lower lower you raise the flag and say I can't take any more there's there's a fair amount of folks that just emotionally get a test of how much money can lose they take everything out and they leave it out so when the market rebounds\nThey never participate in that rebound the all or none mentality kind of timing very tough or this is an old old saying I saw in the opposite of the wall Street Journal I read this morning or yesterday today but it said what's important if it's it's time in the market not timing the market\nOh All right so let's talk taxes for a moment if we can we got a little bit of time and and the um so that tax strategy that is something that you guys do so well\n[laughter] yeah we're certainly not accounts were not CPAs but when it comes to investments we certainly know kind of the lay of the land of how taxation works but remember\nThe the two thousand and Eighteen the new tax reform act I started in January one of this year the standard deduction as high twelve thousand for a single payer twenty four thousand dollars for a deduction if you have married\nIf you're a married couple so just no back last year to Seventeen Seventy two Seventy three percent of the people took a standard deduction us now is going to be like Ninety three or Ninety four percent so there's no doubt", "show_name": "Retirement Boss Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
