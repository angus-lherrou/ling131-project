they're going to buy it from other countries\nThe precedent in an interview with CBS sixty minutes because show gave us last seen on October second entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey

can turn our homes and businesses blown to pieces that's the story and Mexico Beach Florida that town and sustained a direct hit from hurricane Michael\nThe big thing is that when people continue to

damage their Fox is Phil Keating also in Mexico beach\nSearch and rescue operations will continue again today every structures that looked at once but they want to go through every one two or three times just to make sure there are no survivors trapped under the wreckage injured but still alive and also they are looking through five acres from any fatalities\nNineteen deaths in four states have been confirmed Brexit talks could be moving forward speculation as a breakthrough sparks by surprise trip to Brussels\nBy Britain's chief negotiator death is Fox News [noise]\nNow the news radio eleven and a baby whether watch\n[noise]\nAnd I was on the underside I mean there's there's a there's a single benefit divorce benefits survivor benefit\nThere is a spouse will benefit I mean there's just goes on and on and on and it's it's it's complicated I think the government keeps that complicated for a reason yeah this this thing is some people think hey you know what I'm hearing that are going bankrupt trust fund has just shy of three\nTrillion that's what the tea trillion dollars that's in the trust fund it has to burn see that in then payroll taxes would make up somewhere between Seventy five and Seventy nine percent of that benefit even if that was gone so I tell you what it is a big big benefit you want to maximize that\nThe government may hope you don't maximize it but we want to maximize of there\nSo let's get another four percent rule for a bit what what is the central we've all heard it but go ahead and give us a kind of the ten thousand foot view of what that is\nSteve I've ever heard the name William Ben getting I have not William banned in yeah he's the one that invented he was a financial advisor he's the one that invented did the research on the ... percent real and all the four percent rule says is that\nWhatever the amount of money you have when you retire if you're taking come from that to cover expenses\nYou can take if you can take up to four percent\nYou can give yourself and inflation raise each and every year that there is a cost of living raise just like Social Security you can do that in your money will last actually thirty three years everybody says Thirty years but the the original calculations was thirty three years so basically you're retired sixty five\nIt would take you out out to Ninety eight which very few people that that long and you will not run out of your money or this is just a real ... there's no guarantee here but it's what William bend and came up and it kind of has been certainly used with in our industry for an income stream from your assets\nIs that something that ... those are still hold true today I mean I've seen stories where it's you know they they changed that percentage a little bit but as a as a rule of thumb and again just generally speaking does that still hold up\n[laughter] yeah it does and it works really really well and a flat market just a little down market in ... when the markets way down like two thousand eight if you were in strictly stocks down thirty eight percent\nWell if you take four percent from that now you're down sixty percent\nSo what happens when markets are really really down I call it\nIf you know what a dollar cost averaging is and that's what you do and you're ... you're IRAs investment so you're putting in a systematic amount of money one hundred dollars a month three hundred dollars a month a thousand dollars a month what happens is when the stock price of initial price is lower you're buying more shares when it's higher\nYou're buying less there's always buying more when it's low not buying as many as one is high and what happens is is that in itself goes in and put that share price value in your favor well this is like reverse dollar cost averaging\nIf you're if you're selling when it's slow it's bad and that's what happens sometimes we take systematic control so if you have some really some their markets and things are really tough\nYeah then the four percent real I won't say goes out the window but it certainly gets more hard to attain\nWell I'll listen [laughter] they've what you've what you've done for us today is to convince to convince me and I think some others that this is not to do it yourself proposition when we need some help and and you certainly are willing and able to do that\n[laughter] yeah well we're trying to do believe me we want to get a fair returned\nWhen the markets the economy\nIs strong we want to get a competitive return but well we we certainly are trying to do is when the markets take a big big a dip\nOr when the economy is really in a recession or the ... well we want to do is to have a your investments we was like for them to hold up we'd like for them\nYou know now if you're invested in the market there certainly will be a market losses or trying to keep those uh within reason\nSo ah especially if you're taking an income that doesn't just compound I'm I'm I'm your compound itself in a negative way absolutely\nHate they want to open up the phone lines and by folks to give us a call come on and sit down and and and get this plan together and and maybe map out a

[noise]\nThan we are back business retirement boss radio where you take charge of your money and they ... along to help as well\nAs financial advisor gotten an associates and a day or we're going to put you to the test you're ready yeah you're right I thought you might um so we've got some great questions in and let's begin a we've got one you're a says\nI'm I'll be Seventy years old next July to do with my first required minimum distribution\nAnd I'm confused about taking it in the year of reaching Seventy and a half and paying tax on it in that calendar year\nNow that would add to my regular tax burden when my other income is considered or should I take the are empty the following April there by delaying the tax due until the following year when is the most efficient time to take my first are empty that is a great question and I know there's a lot of confusion around that\nYeah it is a good question Les Mis first talk about what the Seventy and a half rule is good okay so it isn't the year you turned Seventy\nIs the year you turned Seventy and a half so I actually had a call from a client this morning and he was telling me about\nHe wants to take out a systematic withdrawal to cover his are empty is required men and distribution is the first of all the government forces people to start taking money out of their traditional retirement plans so that's traditional IRAs traditional\nFor all one case for all three bees for fifty seven governments sap simple I mean any kind of traditional route where you got a tax deduction putting it in they they the government wants money to start coming out at the age of Seventeen and a half and the reason they want that because they they gave you some help\nGoing in on the action they gave you some help of different no taxes now they want their tax money and they want their money back in\nKind of the you know into the system they want us to be working you know within the system of buying goods et cetera so what happens is at seven and a half to get started taking out money the first year three point six five percent\nAnd then in in within four years is four percent within five more years it is five percent it it keeps going up in up and up so the question here was the person's wandering of whether to take it now in the very first year what this person is asking about the very first year teacher seven half you ... you have to take it\nBy the end of that year whatever your balance was December the thirty first the year before have you taken by December thirty first of that year the very first year teacher seven half\nMaybe a turkey says Riyadh is to blame reports\nOut there that there is some sort of audio video evidence of what occurred if that were to emerge or any other ... or ... or frankly of questions here aren't answered a there is no video from leaving that facility or there's got to be a big problem\nGOP Senator Marco Rubio on CBS tough talk marine Ian president Hassan Rouhani aimed at the U.S any speech\nBroadcast on state TV Sunday Rowhani called the Trump Administration the most spiteful American government towards Iran in the past forty years Ronnie appear to be responding to some of President Trump's remarks from the U.N General assembly last month where President Trump called the current Iranian regime that corrupt\nDictatorship and when Rowhani spoke Sunday he told a group of university students that the United states is seeking regime change in Iran\nFox is ... this is Fox News [noise]\n\nWe believe in better\nA better way to invest a better way to serve you and a better result we can help you determine how much risk you're taking red flags that could be potential problems for you\nHow much you're paying fees are commissions potential tax liability or even how to address Social Security call your local wealth financial an income coach Dave's temper of cult in an associates eight eight eight nine seven five bar that's eight eight eight nine seven five to six seven seven [noise]\nEverybody this is retirement boss radio where you take charge of your money and of course helping us alone is Dave ... financial advisor for\nHelping an associate's in so many other things that are all around good guy a just a you know but the Nebraska football team is what it is right [laughter] I\nHave oh are you at you know what we're coming back though baby games that you do it it's a very well thank you seems always do right I mean the Nebraska it's always been a force\nYeah yeah I just got to have some patients but the team this year [laughter]\nAll right I'll just leave it at that\nSo they have a you know one of the things that ah you know again dealing with that with Hurricane Florence and and you know so many people um you know in North and South Carolina or had to deal with that\nBut that's I I I saw that as an opportunity to just talk about what happens when the unexpected happens and and how do you uh whether that storm no pun intended um and it doesn't have to be whether it could be homeless it could be an accident could be any number of things ah and sometimes that really can sort of\nPushes near that financial clip so what can we do that to be ready for these things even though we hope they don't happen\nRight well you know what the unexpected does happen and that's why it's called on expected so what happens with a friend for ... for financial standpoint when you're looking at an emergency fun I think one of the first things is is that I think if you're a single person you probably need\nA little more emergency fund maybe up to six months I think if you're married maybe three to six months but when it should be of what your of your living expenses are so if you've got if you've got a five thousand dollars worth of living expenses each month you should probably go in and have\nAnywhere from three times or just Fifteen thousand\nTo six times which is thirty thousand dollars of at least in in in usually it's in a ... it's at the bank or it's in a money market account money market brokerage account sure in in this money that's not earning a lot of interest\nBut it's readily accessible I mean like ... minutes of that day you can you can take it that gives you some cushion that you don't have to get into a longer term invest the money and maybe be selling\nAt not the right time because we would like to buy low sell high you certainly don't want to sell when you're pricing is low on investment well of\nCourse not [noise] so how do you begin to to you know develop that emergency fund I mean it sounds good in theory and we all know that and and you know ... how do you begin building that what do we do do you would just take a hundred bucks a paycheck and start putting in a way\nThat might be a hundred bucks it might be fifty dollars or might be five hundred dollars I think what happens is is that if you're in a salary type of position what happens is is that you should go in in in an allocate X amount of dollars until you've got that much money in your savings account there's nothing like cash I mean ... Warren Buffett\nOne of the the richest people in the world from Omaha Nebraska of course you know what happens is is that is that he has a tremendous amount of cash on hand what Berkshire Hathaway sure if you take a look at some of the of the big time companies Microsoft\nOracle um they all have a lot of cash apple a lot of cash on hand why because there's bargains out there if they want to buy companies also it gives them a hedge against a a failing market or real downturn in the economy so\nI think it's no different you have to have some discipline but it whether it's a fifty bucks a hundred dollars a couple of hours but until you're up to that three months to six months of emergency fund you shouldn't be putting that they're that in your hedging yourself in case of the unexpected bad time\nOf course one of the other ways that we can sort of the uh get through that is to take a look at what insurance we have and make sure that we have the proper insurance and the proper categories\n[noise] yeah you know what happens is is that why do people buy insurance well first of all\nWhich is really interesting it's one of the few things that you buy any hope you never use it right\nI buy life insurance but gosh I don't want to die to collected I by car insurance I ... I don't I don't want to get an a wreck to collect no of course yeah you know you you buy insurance to basically offset the costly unexpected of that\nThat's why you buy insurance sure so what happens is is that it takes you know it's it's it's very inexpensive\nA to cover the cost of something by insurance than it would be to go in and to pay for just like with car insurance I played it you know I think I'm paying I don't know it's probably a hundred and fifty dollars a month for two vehicles and what happens is we have the same day both\nThose vehicles are we're our fault and and and they both were totaled oh it'd be\nTens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars that's pay every pocket but now with insurance you're offsetting\nYes so that's one thing I think also when you're talking specifically about life insurance\nIf you you know if you\nHave young folks that are still at home and I remember my expertise release around kind of the free retired retired so most of my people that kids are just getting out of the out of the home as a kind of getting on their own and and and paying for their own expenses\nAre getting out of college but what happens is do you still have debt if you still have debt laughed then I think life insurance plays a big factor\nIf you don't have any debt you know getting towards their retirement arena retirement you know how important is to have that that insurance will it isn't life insurance isn't as important than and the last thing I think you know\nFrom from a life insurance standpoint um I see probably is almost as many people at this age the game that's over insured than under insured so so you want to buy what you really need you want to buy the protection of what you need not what you needed at the age of thirty five or forty\nBut at the age of sixty sixty so she lives to ... years of age right\nOkay well good I mean you know that whole thing that whole I'm sure we can have a whole show about insurance and was what it is what avail yeah I'm not but again this one to me is that was one of the most important and that is\nTo make sure you take the emotion out of it I mean when you're dealing with whether it's an illness or whether it's a hurricane or or whatever it might be we are emotionally invested in can sometimes not make the best decisions\n[noise] yeah you don't want to make\nThe decisions um after a you know after a big emotional I'm kind of a misshapen big emotional event has happened and the reason for that is is is there's a left brain has the right brain the left brain is the more I'm I'm kind of calculating\nA mathematical the right brain as more of the emotional part of the brain and what happens is is that your decisions should be made from a factual standpoint\nAnd many times when when tough tough things have happened\nOn whether it be a death in the in the family say a spouse or a child or there's been um um um you know you're retiring or got you've just got fired those are the call now now if you're retiring and you thought about it for a long time know you you pretty much\nKind of went in and and I understand what's happening but if something happens all of a sudden\nThen you probably don't want to make big decisions right after that if you can so so taking emotion you know in in in the stock market itself and I already said it in in today's show but you know you can go back to economics one on one you make money\nBy buying low in selling high course but emotionally Steve people are ingrained\nTo buy Heinz so low when things are just pop in and everything's going great you're just going to get on that bandwagon but the train is almost passed the station and I'll go back to Warren Buffett again he's a value investor he's the one that probably one of the top professional investors ever\nIn in the world and what he does he has lots of cash on hand a lot of that emergency fund but what he does the doubles up companies and purchase companies no doubt\nWhen um the value is still there but the stock prices down ... try not to the big decisions feminine emotional stand when when you're kind of an emotional state", "show_name": "Retirement Boss Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "14"}
