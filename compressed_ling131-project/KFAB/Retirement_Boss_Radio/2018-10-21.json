streets of see that right yeah\nAnd then um where else do we have to worry about too you know taking care of our retirement making sure that we shouldn't avoid some things in in the process\n[noise] you know we we talk a lot about in income plan because when you're when you're working the income plan is your work income I mean especially if you're married husband and wife both working you got good income coming in hopefully dead as being paid off\nIn the kids are through school now when you get towards retirement age but what happens is is that\nNot every one but the majority of the people that I talked to income plays a a vital role in and I always I always talked about the five pillars of income five pillars so so what are those five pillars of income well you've got wages\nBecause that's a pillar okay I've got pensions got 'em um invest double assets okay soaked into your you know\nWe're retirement assets your brokerage assets you your savings accounts et cetera\nYou've got required minimum distributions I include this is an income source because it's Seventy and a half on your traditional retirement plans for one case I raise for three beef for fifty seven governments all of those are tired of Lance you're forced to start taking money out at seven eight and a half\nFrom the U.S government so that that's an income source and then Social Security\nSo I have an expertise in in social ...\nYou're claiming of window maximize that Social Security and and I'll say one thing about so scary I always say it's the most um flexible\nOf of all of your income streams I mean ... you could started as early at ... at the age of sixty two at a discount or you could wait as late as Seventy\nAthletic keep growing I take an income but keep growing so they benefit gets bigger when you start taking it it's it's it's it's quite flexible compared to other income streams so from an income plan is kind of figuring out where it is the best time\nFor you to go and when not to just take your Social Security but what income sources should I take from one of the things\nThe that comes up a a lot with myself but people wouldn't think out on their own is they were just going to go ahead and take that Social Security earlier at a discount means they're not going to make as much but taking your earlier and they were going to go in and in in let their say retired but money's\nGo all the way until they're forced to take it out but remember if you look between the ages of sixty two and full retirement age\nYour your Social Security on an average grows between guaranteed\nBetween five and six percent a year not counting inflation you throw like this you're two percent inflation on you know that you might be growing seven or eight percent and after the full retirement age it grows a guaranteed eight percent plus your cost of living this year was ten percent so where can you get that kind of return\nFrom your your savings or invest the money that has the safety of the U.S government behind that like Social Security that's we can't\nBe you know can't live in such a thing absolutely am I think that's what you should do no I'm not saying that that that if it's if it's wholesale across the board but what I Am saying is you should you get if we get together\nAnd we've got a consultation that is one of the things that we're going to go in and I'm going to try to bring up information give you education about what your options are and once you have several options that you can do it in your best interest as what you don't want to do is is is look at something down the road and say boy if I only knew that\nI Would have done it differently fast what we want to go in and avoid\nThat sounds great well in fact why don't we invite folks to give us a

[noise]\nYou've been your whole working life building up your nest egg saving enough in the last few into your retirement [noise]\nNow at the time to protect that nest egg is you're heading into the financial red zone it's crucial you preserve door assets that you continue building towards your dream retirement\nDole your local wealth financial an income coach Dave temper of colds and an associate eight eight eight nine seven five boss best eight eight eight nine seven five to six seven seven [noise]\n\nAnd we are back this retirement boss radio where you take charge of your money and here to help us with that of course Dave Dave's the financial advisor helping and associates been doing this for about Thirty years plus thirty plus years and be happy to share that knowledge and and uh help us learn along the way right there\n[laughter] yeah you know what it is funny because when I started my dad had a car dealership and I got it was out of college and had worked for my dad for years and years and\nUh before college in the ... and the body and then I got into sales when I was a junior in high school but after college I came back referred out for four years that's been Chrysler's having to travel so that's when when dad sold his dealership in Nineteen eighty one that's when I got into the financial services arena so ... what I asked\nFound is in the good times or you certainly learned some things but in the really tough times in the market or the economy or interest rates go against is that's really when you you learn the most so and so I feel like I've got a a a pretty good background through the years of just discovery when it comes to this business\nYou know and and again there are some you know some sort of universal truth so to speak or when it comes to retirement planning and and that first one and we talk about it all the time but it is such a crucial fees and that is the income plan\n[noise] yeah you know and we talk a lot about this than her show but but having knowing what income sources to pull from and when\nAnd how much is coming on in versus of what your casual your expenses you living expenses are it's extremely important you know I heard this years and years and years ago and it's so true not all but most people take more time planning\nFor a two week vacation than they ever will for a lifetime of retirement\nAnd so when it comes to myself and we're talking through the consultation I'm bringing up some things that maybe are\nUm maybe there are a a difficult to talk about with your spouse or maybe really not address them but what I'm trying to do is when you leave that appointment that you truly have uncovered some things that you didn't know before you came in that can help you with your retirement plan\nYeah absolutely because that that'd be ... in your right sometimes it's difficult to have those conversations and I think sometimes to stave correct me if I'm wrong but sometimes in your situation where you're sitting across the table from a couple a you become a bit of a marriage counselor cause there and they may have different pages\nOh you're you're exactly right I mean you know we're about eighty percent financial advisor and we're about a twenty percent a therapist and on and everyone is unique and everyone is different so ill or my son one time who who is now twenty six years old\nLeaves the American people wondering is us Saudi policy been driven by something other than national interests Republican\nCongressman Peter king says he agrees on a search for answers but it's not time to look for conspiracy\nWhen Saudi Arabia did was savages evil that's be condemned we have to take action\nBoth men appeared on ABC this week Fox let's go now Scott about thirty people have been taken to hospitals after a floor collapsed during a party near south in South Carolina near the campus of Clemson University [noise] this is Fox\nNews [noise]\nLook I hear all the commercials on there and I can confidently say you'll see for St Thomas's financial when were you we have something in common with armor planning doesn't have\nTo be complicated take advantage of our luggage and make sure that your retirement plan really is the line with your own minimum wage on coal your low level will financial and in some code name for a moment of those nine seven five eight eight eight nine seven\nAnd to sing seven [noise]\n\nAnd welcome at I'm consumer advocates tapes at all in this ... retirement boss radio where you take charge of your money hand to help us do that of course in Studio is Dave Dave is a financial advisor at accountant associates they've no stranger to this business you've been doing this a long time Dave about Thirty years old\nYeah thirty plus years started in Nineteen eighty one and um they had a car dealership and back in the days when Chrysler's having troubles in late seventies early eighties dad sold that dealership and I got into financial services and I've been in business for a long time so yeah I'm just starting to get the hang of things have\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter] no I think you know what I say that in jest right [laughter] well I think that\nI mean one of the things that you certainly can bring to the table is is is that knowledge of up over the past Thirty years how drastically the retirement picture has changed for folks in how to accomplish and how to get there\nYeah you know what it's um it's kind of a moving environment in in in my expertise revolves around and working with folks who are\nThinking about retiring getting closer to retirement free retirement and then maybe the just retirement so there's no doubt that at this time period you've got a lot of changes a lot of transitions in your life and and you know one of the things I think is is important\nIs that you kind of have to you have to get a strategy you you have to know what your game plan is going to be in one of the things we've been so fortunate for the last nine and a half years we've had a good stock market\nWas a very very good stock market in fact it's the longest Bull Run really in modern history mean we've not had a not a correction is just to ten percent declined we've had we've had\nSeveral of those right but but as far as the twenty percent loss in the market which is a bear market normally happens a little over every five years\nIf we're almost double that now we're still having a ...\nPercent corrections so that stock market volatility up even though\nIs it maybe as kinda put people to sleep a little bit here because the market has been solid and have had up games and we're we're we're close to a double digit again this year right now but remember what goes up certainly can and will go down it's just a matter of when\nAnd and one of the things that we're trying to accomplish in this segment is to is to talk about strategies to make sure that you've got enough money that will take it to retirement and then through retirement\nIn retirement um it's a little different than when you're working you've got it up a virtually assured income stream from your job as long as you're working you know that ten Ninety nine income or that W to income you've got that coming on the end but once you retire\nNow you couldn't be working part time I mean a lot more people are doing that than they did ten Fifteen Years ago\nBut once you give up their full time job at Maine money earning job then what happens you got to start looking at what kind of different types of income streams do you have\nAnd so one of the the the big things\nIs Social Security Ninety four percent\nOf all the people in the U.S\n[noise] they've got enough quarterly credits you need forty quarterly credits for basically ten years of working in today's day and time\nIf you're in fifty three hundred dollars or more than you get those four quarterly credit so most people have that Social Security or availability and when you claim that that is the big thing right so so I\nAnd expertise around Social Security claiming you'd be surprised there's only about five percent of the American public that really understand Social Security and believe it or not um there's only about about\nTwenty twenty to twenty five percent of financial advisors who really understand the ins and out are so scared that can give you a very good uh kinda entail of went to maximize that Social Security so\nThat that that Social Security income it plays a big role over over sixty percent of the people\nIn in the in the U.S today Social Security is a mainstay for they didn't come so I think a strategy is when when do you take it when can maximize my Social Security compared to the other types of interest rates of assets that I Do have\nOne of the things I think all year from people all the time and we noticed to be true we've talked about before David is that is that the majority of people turned sixty two and they turn on Social Security and that isn't terribly best idea in fact is often a good idea\nYeah it's often not it could be I mean there are there specific is why I mean there could be that maybe they're bad health and you know or maybe they got just bad genes or maybe they have to have the money but take those aside\nYeah usually usually when you take early when you look back to something that was so scared of that you don't want to have happened to you is you don't want to after you take it you look back and say gosh if I Would have only known is that right but yeah you only have half of what you\nCan do that because because you've got someone like you have that can who is an independent and ... and ... really look at this thing with you know open eyes so to speak to make sure you're making the right decision\nHighly literally make the ... yeah I mean we we\nOffer it says is no cost there's absolutely no obligation and it's on a a Social Security analysis to win the maximize eleven page report\nAnd uh and it shows you take an early taking as late as you can about maximizing and I tell ya everyone's situation is unique when it comes to Social Security so yeah ... if you'd like that yes certainly um give us a call a light up a time and we can go in and get that for sure\nSo again Social Security that um that's certainly one strategy and and boy there are I mean there are dozens and maybe even hundreds of ways to claim right different strata different scenarios\nBarrier for your absolute levels right there are single or it's going to understand\nI mean there's there's a there's a single benefit divorce benefits survivor benefit there is a spouse or benefits I mean there's just goes on and on and on and it's it's it's complicated I think the government keeps that complicated for a reason yeah the easiest thing is that some people\nHey you know what I'm here that is going bankrupt able to trust fund has just shy of three\nTrillion that's where the tea trillion dollars that's in the trust fund it has to burn through that invent payroll taxes would make up somewhere to Seventy five in Seventy nine percent of that benefit even if that was gone so I tell you what it is a big big benefit you want to maximize and\nThe government may help you don't maximize it but we want to maximize of we'd have either\nSo let's get another four percent rule for a bit what I Want is the central we've all heard it but go ahead and give us a kind of a ten thousand foot view of what that is\nSteve I've ever heard the name William Ben ... and I have not William than getting yeah he's the one that invented he was a financial advisor he's the one that invented did the research on the four percent real and all the four percent rule says is that\nWhatever the amount of money you have when you retire if you're taking come from that to cover expenses you can take\nIf you can take up to four percent\nYou can give yourself and inflation raise each and every year that there is a cost of living raise just like Social Security you can do that in your money will last actually thirty three years everybody says Thirty years but the the original calculations was thirty three years so basically you're retired sixty five\nIt would take you out out to Ninety eight which very few people that long and you will not run out of your money or this is just a real ... thumb there's no guarantee here but it's what William bending came up and it kind of has been certainly used with in our industry for an income stream from your assets\nIf that's something that ... those are still hold true today I mean I've seen stories where it's you know they they changed that percentage a little bit but as a as a rule of thumb and again just generally speaking does that still hold up\n[laughter] yeah it does and it works really really well and the flat market just a little down market in ... when the markets way down like two thousand eight if you were in strictly stocks you got thirty eight percent\nWell if you take four percent from that now you're down sixty percent\nSo what happens when markets are really really down I call it", "year": "2018", "show_name":
