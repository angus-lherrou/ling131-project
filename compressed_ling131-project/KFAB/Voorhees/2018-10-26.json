everything we can to put her up for their head\nCatholic priests have been guilty of fondling individuals' whether they're minors or whether they're over the age of Eighteen that is certainly happened I'm not suggesting that has a another thing has happened though people are accusing Catholic leadership of misconduct and they were getting payouts\nThe Catholic Church even if police whether they looked into it or not\nThey just looked at the person who said oh you're accusing someone how many thousands of dollars do you want and I thought that was a dangerous road to go down because if you can just accused someone if anything under the sun and get paid to shut up about it\nWhy aren't we all accusing everyone if you're an unscrupulous human being and I think there are a few of those out there\nWhy wouldn't you just make an accusation Steve you can get paid for it are now again\nI'm not suggesting than any specific instance that either one of these things happen I mean if there's an investigation and someone's found guilty than than we know if there was no investigation of someone got paid for it I don't know that we know self police investigated\nNot and and they found out well there there's no criminal charge here so father nearly moved from O'Neill to Omaha he became a a a a Catholic priest at St once us last that is up on the west Pacific near one hundred and fifty third street\nMay apparently he was removed from the ministry after a Twenty one year old male accused him of sexual assault involving kissing him and fondling him\nIn this instance Omaha police tells our television partner W O W T six news they investigated this case and they found that the case did not rise to the level of a crime\nNonetheless it's a two strikes and you're out situation or father Neely I honestly I don't blame the Catholic diocese for doing that\nI mean this is something that obviously everyone needs to be incredibly careful about so\nThey removed at what they didn't do is tell the parishioners and the parishioners finally you know this has been since may this has been you know it kind of came out a little bit in June there were some rumors I wear what happened the father newly\nAnd here we are all these months later and they finally admitted yeah there were a couple of accusations against him there was some words on a on Facebook this past week\nOr that suggested that maybe there was a third individual who would are accused of his father or something and the Catholic Church removed him while now people want to know how come you didn't tell us where are the criminal charges well there's no criminal charges so\nWhat do you want to be told if you're a parishioner at St wins this loss and one week you've got a a a priest up they're telling you the good word and the next several weeks you're like what happened to that guy what do you want to be told if there is no criminal charge\nIs is this really no another instance where if you accuse someone of something\nThat suddenly the accuser is automatically one hundred percent right and the accused needs to go away where is he supposed to go he's not been found he's not even been charged with anything from a criminal standpoint and his livelihood is gone I don't know if this guy is innocent or guilty but we have a court system that's supposed to\nDeal with this kind of thing and where people automatically have a knee jerk reaction here is they automatically assume that the church just move this guy around with out an investigation and I don't know that we can assume that I don't know that I Want to assume that about the Catholic Church but last night\nThey had a town hall meeting at the church\nOr where the the archbishop of the local diocese George Lucas came there and apologized he said we were not transparent about this and what seemed like a good decision on paper failed you the parishioners of this church it was the wrong decision\nAnd we're going to take a real good look at the assignments of priests and review them again to make sure all freeze their waste appropriately now that's fine but\nAt well on one hand I'm sticking up for the church on the other hand I mean we've heard this before\nAnd it seems like these accusations and more than accusations or admissions of guilt happen over and over again\nI don't know what one needs to do about this other than this needs to be fully transparent and investigated by investigators who have a detailed\nExperience in these types of accusations I mean the Senate Judiciary committee brought in a special prosecutor to deal with\nThat woman who accused judge Kavanaugh wrongdoing thirty some years ago and uh and and and they knew what they were doing the Catholic Church should be no different the police investigators should be no different [noise]\nAnd hopefully that will change um\nWe have more regarding the accusations against judge Kavanaugh and we have accusations of the same major against several Google executives it's not just the Catholic Church has been accused of wrongdoing moving people around paying people to be quiet\nAnd you're not going to hear as much about the Google story
