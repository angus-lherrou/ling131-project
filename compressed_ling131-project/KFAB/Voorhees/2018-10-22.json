F. A. V. I'm scot more he uses pleasure to welcome into the studio Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse who is now I was his second\nBook is called them senator owes a little disappointed to find out it wasn't about giant radioactive killer ants\nIt actually is closely enough that's the idol but yeah I I I kind of flip through it I didn't see I was looking for the pictures\nOf it was so was my seven year old yeah have you seen the movie them I've seen the movie poster yeah old theater I went to it it's pretty good movie poster of a radioactive killer ants Nineteen fifties side by this one though the full title is them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal is this about you and people who voted for you know say they can't wait to vote you out of office does that with his books about\nAgain it's like the killer ad so you can find lots of subjects but no that's not the main point in the ... the main point is political tribalism is ... and our time because we're having collapse of the kinds of tribes that actually make people happy family isn't nuclear families in statistical collapse in the U.S\nWorkplace average duration is getting a lot shorter than we have half as many friends as we did in the U.S per person as twenty five years ago there's a lot going on in the country because of the digital revolution and a lot of times\nTo pretend in politics what's wrong in politics is fixable in politics I don't think that's mostly true\nI think that I I don't want to try and dissect your dual oblong got a little bit here this morning police don't do that to me because you you have this kind of this old world\nCommonsense old school or ideology you've got this idealism you're like you know Jimmy Stewart you know and are you going to Washington you you want what's best for the country you want people to come together and the whole system really doesn't seem to be set up to\n... where one guy with these ideas can make a change but you're still try and you don't seem like you've been broken down yet\nKnow or do you feel like you've you've made a debt because it seems like you've just made a lot of people mad at you [noise] well I don't actually think that's true statistically I Know that there are lots of people who probably call your show who are frustrated with me and we should wrestle through some of those particular issue will but\nBut I actually think what's happening is we there's a there's a big new research study out last week two weeks ago called hidden tribes which shows that about eighty six percent of the American people want to throw all of politics away they've stopped paying attention and they don't have any hope they think it's all a moral a screw it\nI'm eight percent of the leftist politically addicted and what's new is we have now up to six percent of the right being politically addicted acting like politics as the center of life\nNot only is that not true the vast majority of Americans and the vast majority of ... of Nebraska is don't believe that so I think defining truth things about the fact that most of what matters is in ... and under wouldn't Fremont and north band that's just true now Washington should do a small set of really important stuff\nAnd on cyber were making a lot of progress on it it doesn't make as much headlines as Elizabeth Warren's DNA ah so what's wrong with our politics is mostly the circus atmosphere underneath that there's some good things happening\nYeah it but I don't you think that with\nWith social media and the ability for people to get out on social media and say whatever they want feel ten feet and bullet proof about it or that a lot of you know a lot of friendships have been fractured a co workers have been fighting neighbors have seen who's got the bigger sign for the other you know political opponent\nAnd in marriages and relationships have broken up because of of all of this and it seems to be senator around one guy and that's president Donald Trump a man who you early on we are not a huge fan of I think it's it's safe to say\nAh how much does does Donald Trump have a a bearing and all of this or was it they're ready to crack anyway and then here comes Trump who has no problem taking the wrecking ball out\nYeah well friends so I think the overwhelming majority of our story is much more than two years old so President Trump is a fascinating guy in a market earned an entertainer and he loves to picket scabs so obviously some of this moment a is exacerbated in the last Eighteen to twenty four months\nBut the vast majority of what we're talking about here is two plus decades in the coming and it's probably decades end of the future before we fix it and that is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost everything that makes people happy is tied to roots do you have a family do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have a local worshipping community\nThe digital revolution is undermining place and tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless and so these keyboard cowboys you talk about a ranting on social media about something\nThe vast majority of that is not what normal people are doing or want to do and there's a lot of data frankly that shows the people who are most addicted to doing that have less and less connection to place their statistically really highly likely to be lonely so one fact for you\nIf you go from two hundred five hundred social media friends are five hundred to a thousand social media friends you don't actually get any happier\nIf you know the person who lives two doors away from you statistically you're much likely or to actually be happy\nAnd the more time you spend on social media the less likely you are to know the person two doors away from you so our politics is going through this roiling moment which is downstream from a digital revolution which is a couple of decades in the coming President Trump can't fix this because President Trump didn't cause this it's an older problem\nIn what you're talking about there with the fact that we're more connected than ever before with what's in our pocket with our phone but at the same time it from a humanities standpoint we're less connected than ever before does that pendulum swing back the other way for does it get worse\nSo so if it gets worse I think we're genuinely screwed like I actually think the republic won't go on at some point in the future I think it's the Eighteen fifties if we keep getting worse I actually am optimistic about this I think we will get better\nBut it will require new habits for the digital rootless age we're becoming semi nomadic people I'm older than you are but in the Nineteen seventies when I was born average duration that affirmed was twenty six years\nAverage duration and a job for that was for a primary breadwinner average duration and a job right now is for years and getting shorter well what does that mean it means we're producing more stuff the economy is going to produce more high quality low cost stuff than ever before\nUm but it means you're not going to have co workers Fifteen and twenty and twenty five years in your life\nTons of data shows males actually don't build any new friendships after age twenty five the majority of their relationships are co workers will tend to have you don't have long term co workers you get a lot lonely or I think will solve this problem but we're not going to solve it through politics again there's a lot the politics needs to do I fly away from home\nI think the argument that I'm trying to make is we need to be thinking ten and twenty five years in the future and right now almost no one in Washington is doing that and uh we need to be preparing for the age when thirty and thirty five and forty year olds are disrupted out of their jobs\nMid career forever more we need to be preparing for the age of cyber war and we're gonna have to persuade a whole bunch of people if we're going to preserve the first amendment\nLet's go around the horn here on some issues the migrant caravan the president says we've got to stop them at the border he's been making the threat I think that the time for making the threats about over in the time for action is now or what does he need to do about the situation with the Caribbean\nYeah so two big things are one or we need long term immigration reform that includes actual border security so lots of the stuff the president says about the wall I think he's open to re interpreting it around a fence which frankly is what we need to do because we need a lot more high tech surveillance\nOr at the border on one physical wall won't be as effective as all the drones and technology that other folks want to do and I think the president's position is aligned with that in the long term so we need to do that but\nWe also need to get the message out there in Central America\nThat the policies of twenty Thirteen and twenty fourteen\nThat led to this assumption that you had guaranteed admission to the United states if you got to the border and were arrested the catch and release policies of the last four and five years are terrible the president was right they catch and release was terrible I made a whole bunch of videos in twenty Thirteen fourteen and then went and talked to\nPresident Obama as I got elected that we needed to stop catch and release not just at the border where a huge share of people were still getting through but down in Central America where people were ... paying mules and drug ... or um human traffickers money to try to get their kids into the U. S. so a big piece of this way upstream from the border we also need to have the board of the security\nSaudi Arabia that it's a hell of a fist fight you don't bring a bone sort of a fist fight so I don't\nThere's a lot there's a lot wrong with the Saudi explanation and the reality is you start in the middle east and it's hard to find good guys that we want to be allied with and yet we know that post nine eleven we should have done this before nine eleven since nine eleven almost all Americans understand that\nThat the flood of um she ... terrorism in the middle east when it erupts there it will get to us and so we need some partnerships there and the Saudis have been part\nPartners short answer on this Mitch McConnell saying yeah we might be able to do something about Obamacare if we keep the house and Senate here\nDidn't do anything last time yeah it was so we got a bunch of Republicans who claimed to be anti Obamacare and then love to sell their people to sort of cotton candy of protecting the government can solve every problem in health care it's not true we need more Republicans who actually believe conservative stuff\nWhere do I get this book them why we hate each other and how to heal a get it at your local Omar Lincoln bookseller or you can get it on Amazon as well if that's by Ben Sasse author of also the vanishing\nAmerican adult a couple of a fine reads from Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse\nGo big red thank you very much for hanging out given so much time this morning like Scott regret now go talk to all those rivers about foreign policy they love it yeah they they love that kind of thing we might have to live right here but not now because we've got John Callahan here\nThis morning Oscar buzz extra is brought to you by the Nebraska spine hospital\nWhat's your next year I'm Sean Callahan of news radio eleven ten\nK.
