controversy number one we have a video featuring someone alleged to be the first lady parading around the oval office in the nude is this an actual controversy or is this a fake controversy\nNot all these trumped up controversies are ones where they're blaming Trump for it not all of them so is this is this a real thing we need to dwell upon or is this fake Lucy you decide\nI say okay you say fake side note on this but still trumped up controversy number two is this real are fake because we're talking about hip hop rapper\nT I a new study finds that there's a lot of smoking and vaping an RN B and hip hop music videos and people are worried that might be sending a bad message to the youth of America\nWhen watching rap videos featuring graphic language\nThemes sexual contact a and violence you know we're concerned\nThat these kids watching these rap videos were a bunch of big booty a Hughes are running around getting a slap by a Pam's who are they in shooting rival gang members I I'm concerned that maybe the youth of America are getting the wrong message as some of these pimps in these videos are vaping\nAnd as we all know vaping as a gateway to smoking as we all know smoking is a gateway to instill that\n\nReal are fake controversy that the they're concerned that they ... I'll say it's real from the standpoint of let's let's move this around 'cause I like to I like to feature hypocrisy here\n\nLet's say that the n._r._a. has a new video a promotional new video for the national Rifle Association where they're talking about how great it would be to be a member of the n._r._a.\nAnd it showed a bunch of guys out there with the rifles with their guns and they were smoking would this be a national controversy that everyone in the media would be gripped too they they would have this featured on the top story\nEvery newscast twenty four hour news cycle is on CNN or MSNBC headline news all the rest of these they would be they would talk about nothing other than I Can't believe these NRA guys are sending a bad message to the youth of America\nBy smoking in the firearms are bad enough but they're also smoking vaping ... well forty percent of them are ... well up to fifty percent as what it says in this video between forty and fifty percent of the videos each year and hip hop videos feature smoking\nOr if if they had a bunch of NRA videos and between forty and fifty percent of these videos feature someone smoking or vaping this would be the biggest controversy on the planet\nOr at least one of them because it's that's conservative Trump loving culture now this is not conservative not Trump loving culture except for Kanye West\nAnd as such as just put out there is wasn't this special and and then everyone moves on I'm prepared to move on I wouldn't care one way or the other I truly wouldn't\nI'm just pointing out that if it went the other way and it was a more conservative group that was smoking vaping and in their promotional material it would be a huge story well census R. and B. hip hop or\n\nIf it was a bunch of conservative country music stars or something like that that we're constantly degrading women with their lyrics and the themes and their videos and this was a more conservative thing this was a more Trump be saying it would be a huge deal but because that happens regularly and R. and B. hip hop videos\nEh\nJust pointing out the hypocrisy so for that I'm going to say is a it's a real controversy that you really won't hear anything about story number three in ...\nIt's health and Human Services secretary let me try that again health and Human Services secretary Alex aids or in this proposal to let you know when you're watching prescription drug commercials how much that drug costs the drug companies have a couple of pretty good arguments\nBut then they have one that's completely wrong we'll get into this and two minutes\nScott vorhees\nNews radio eleven ten ...\nHi this is Chris Baker for coupon pharmacy listen if you have a senior family\nMember having trouble getting around take a look at a scooter available for rental or purchase pharmacy provides scooters their big\nSeller is the pride go go a leap traveler very hot in the scooter world also don't forget travel vaccinations and flu shot scuba pharmacy dot com it's coupon pharmacy dot com locations in Omaha and in Fremont remember their your neighborhood friendly pharmacy coup bought pharmacy coupon pharmacy dot com\nHigh as various admire with news of another great information that learning about about the fabulous biking river cruises this one is brunch and bubbling coming up Saturday morning November third at film would ruin the baking hills ... village\nThis features of biking river cruises Paris to the Swiss Alps crews and two or with my good friends Ralph Lauren Williams from cruise planners ...\nI'll be there too and I hope you'll join us these information sessions are great you'll find out all about biking river cruising find out about the specifics of this itinerary and special pricing by the way on this cruise\nThe Luxembourg American Cemetery as part of it discover ancient Roman career taste exquisite most al race lingers and visit the German winds out and burned castle there are so much more and you'll hear all about it Saturday morning November third\nBeacon hills are no charge at all we do need you to sign up those we know how many people to plan for and you can do that easily\nAt ... dot com click on a cruise planners better\nShop ... first check out the twenty eighth ... the acts not loaded with ... monitoring hate is just lay it loses audio stopping to test drive on today [laughter] street in Omaha this is what ...\nHi I'm Gerald in my first for DWI eyes that blood alcohol level is point five four but I still had twenty more years of drinking for the first time that forty one years I have felt all because of the challenger\nNear needed vehicle and do go to to see them id dot org\nNow is always a species in contrast to the radio eleven ten K.
