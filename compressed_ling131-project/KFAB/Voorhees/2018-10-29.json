Fort Worth for fourteen shot seven killed\nThis stuff is not going to stop but if you don't have\nSomebody there that charm you just don't have a chance because they've already when they show up at your house of worship\nIn their arm you're not going to talk of that I've had people tell me we'll just talk and I actually had people say we'll just talk about one lady said just repeal commend the name of Jesus y by getting his alive what are these people thinking\nThey're coming to kill you have got to have some foresee quibbling to what they had\nThis guy in the ... guy other day who ended up in a Kroger are but first tried to get into the church why wasn't able to get into the church I did not hear that part of the story\nThat's a great question I'm Glad you brought that up or almost forget about doors were locked and then the seminars we always tell these churches during the week lock your doors even on Sunday Morning when everybody's in there go ahead\nThe doors that are not used\nIt's just a little thing that you can do that might as if it ... the church there in Kentucky that probably saved all of that he had enough to kill everybody in their not far ammo and stuff so it's just a little thing you know the scripture says the little boxes full the bed and you're\nA little Fox is can ruin a whole of and you're in other words something\nThat you do that may seem so insignificant or small or could really turn out to be something big you know good or bad but if you have [noise] you know you take those measures there is a good chance you're going to be able to save some live\nWell in ... when they ran but if someone shows up waving a gun around and and pounding on the door yeah you don't let them in but if someone just says oh I'm I'm late for services and you let them in and then he reveals he has a weapon\nAnd and I think it has to be more than just locking the doors are you advocating for parishioners to be able to carry concealed weapons or an armed guard\nWeather on the lock the doors were you just have a lot of a no criminals and killers they always look for opportunity\nThat's what they work on they look for opportunities so you have to remove as many other opportunities as possible 'cause there'll be easily discouraged that door is locked they'll go somewhere else and it's true you could let somebody and the charm\nAnd there are many other things that we teach you know you wanna do you want to greet every body that comes in you want to shake everybody's hand it's called disrupting the rhythm if you show up with the intent to kill the more you're greeted in the more you talk to\nAnd just the more that you're you know just just confronted and loving way there's a good chance\nThat they're not going to do anything you'd have to think about that and then in the Charleston mask or I'm sure you remember that the Charleston nine African Americans killed in the church\nUh you know he'd sit there with 'em for Fifteen minutes you know they thought he was interested in the Bible study but ... he was wearing winter clothing in summertime and he had a fanny pack you know a little pack their around his waist\nThat right there should be what we call the clothes and after they bow their heads he waited until they found their heads and close the rats he got to put our our quote one survivors said that when he pulled that gun out he reloaded four or five times\nAnd many people don't know this one of the men killed there that night of the Reverend Daniel Senate he was also a minister he was killed at night\nOr he usually carried a gun and he left his gun in the car that night his son got the keys to the car later and he had left his gun on the front seat he might have had a good chance of stopping that killed her that night because he didn't have to reload four or five times I Believe it was five times\nYou've been going around the country with these sheep dogs seminars now for almost a decade on line and\nSheep dog safety training dot com or think you can also really put in sheep dog seminars dot com and you have the same website we're talking here we're just another moment when Jimmy ... but you know the philosophical question is the one that I I think some people\nHave the hardest time getting around and then he is you know how do you respond to people so you don't need security in church if you have enough faith in God you touched on it a moment ago I'd like to do a little bit deeper into that answer if you will Jimmy\nWell that's my favorite questions to answer because what I'd like to do is say I'll tell you what he believed that way uh I just got a I was texting while ago with Sherry Pomeroy you've heard of her husband Frank twenty six people murdered and his church last November\nIncluding his daughter as Frank or his fight was he's a man of faith as Dr out merits of Fort Worth Texas ... wherever it's his fight fourteen shot and killed the truth of the matter is and what happens to people and I'm a forty five minutes please don't take this wrong\nReligion has a strong a tendency to dumb people down\nAnd they will think we're in the house of worship we don't need anything what would you say the Nigerian sure if you look at one thousand choking on to the ground in two thousand twelve I radical jihadi what do you say to all of these people pushing nine hundred\nViolent deaths Allen faith based property in the last few years a fate that works is dead ... any time you read in the scripture of people exercising fake\nThey were not sitting there passively doing nothing they did something and then their fate it manifested in some kind of work you know Peter Head fight to walk on the water but he did step out of the vote\nName and had said that he could be him and his leprosy so he went down to the Jordan River in depth than it's seven times and that's what he had to do the confirmed that he had faith so we said get these churches\nJesus said on your guard against men they were harmed you in the house of worship be on your car he didn't say just sit there and be slaughtered\nWe have churches say this all the time because I just don't understand what if I if if you do if you don't have a work that backs up your beliefs are fate you are not exercising fake fake without works\nIs dead so we encourage people have faith and a lot of work\nBack it up and at the same time you know fight token life is what remains first Corinthians selfish have enough love this is what we do ... how about having enough love after to protect your flock when you go home at night you lock the doors on your car locked doors on your house\nYou know it's not 'cause you don't have faith you're trying to protect your family what would you think or why do you think any less than that when you go to a house of worship knowing what's going on in this country\nBut it it puzzles me sometimes but it's just a misunderstanding of faith in the same religion have that effect on many religion can make you do dumb things rather you know that I mean it can make you bought an airplane and fly it into a tall building\nAnd do and that's what the ... the negative side of religion so we\nWould make a good argument that we usually have everybody can voted within the first thirty minutes gives\nRussia you even more Jesus said right but at the same time there were places that you bought it because he knew people were looking to killing so he didn't go there and say I'll just go anyway and have fight he had to work tobacco as fate you John seven one says he did not go to the
