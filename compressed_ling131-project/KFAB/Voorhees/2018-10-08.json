hiding in trash cans taken outside for disposal they got out Saturday Night a witness\nSaw them this is Fox News [noise]\nDo more to his gentle too on Terry what he news radio eleven tend to be we're getting ready for a visit from President Trump tomorrow he's committed Council Bluffs Nebraska Congress debated tells news radio ... cute baby he\nToo will be taking part in that rally it as a excited to hear what your best to say about the economy and jobs\nThere was a young man Seventeen years old and a Pennsylvania high school Seneca Valley High school in Pennsylvania and this doesn't this only has to do with the Brett Kavanaugh case in that it's the same kind of story\nHe was accused\nThis past spring of having assaulted a classmate in July of two thousand and Seventeen teenage girl classmate comes out says he assaulted me and then in one of her friends said yes I witnessed the assault so now you have from cooperation he did this\nI saw him do it he was charged in juvenile court he was given a consent decree in which he admitted no fault but he had to commit to check in with a probation officer for the next six months\nSo while that's going on they apparently didn't feel like this was enough punishment\nBecause in April a second girl claimed that not\nOnly did he assault her entered her home\nAnd assaulted her two of her friends came out and said we witness the assault\nSo now you have five people who are there have been assaulted or witness the assault by this this boy and this happened during his probationary period authorities coming to school they haul him out of school in shackles in handcuffs he's placed on home confinement pending a hearing\nIn the resulting investigation\nAnd one of the school officials who was a part of this thought to turn on the microphone\nHave the first accuser recorded by school official officials as saying [noise] fine we made up the assault accusations he didn't assault anybody we just don't like him\nSo five girls or don't like this boy accused him twice of assault including essentially\nBreaking and entering\nAccused him twice of assault and then the three friends came up and said yeah we witnessed it he did it\nSo\nIf we're to a point in this country where an accusation is enough to ruin somebody's life\nAnd I use that phrase because that is what the ah one of the writers on Stephen coal bears late night show on CBS said on Twitter before the confirmation vote on Saturday afternoon aerial doom us posted on Twitter quote whatever happens I'm just glad we're ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life unquote\n\nThe people who feel this way the people who act this way are you know it's it 'cause it's Republicans as conservatives who are accused of not believing women not listening to women not respecting women what about these people\nWho treat accusations of the most serious nature so cavalierly as we can just love them again a lot of them against someone just because it ruined his life\nAnd why do they do that\nThe writer for coal bears show came out with an apology here's why she said she said that quote\nThe last couple of weeks have been hard for the country and for me personally the complexity of frustration anger and sadness can't be accurately conveyed on Twitter and I regret my tone deaf attempt at sarcasm in the wake of it unquote\n... why is this so personal for you do you have a case that's going to be tried before\nThe Supreme Court or are you a defense attorney or your prosecutor frustration anger sadness couple\nIt's been hard for me personally and the country why because for years they've been saying that you put those conservatives in power and minorities are going to have rights taken away women are not going to be respected and have their rights taken away gay people are gonna be round up during the tar\nOr we're going to be at war constantly they're going to ruin the environment and they're only going to make sure that the only money in jobs go to their rich fat cat white Republican friends\nWell here we are now a couple of years after President Trump was elected and we have record no record low unemployment we have an economy that they don't know how high
