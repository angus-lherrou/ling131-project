F. A. B. gourmet club we've been doing them for about\nTen years and I said from the beginning\nBecause sometimes in these events we we give you some things that might be a bit outside our comfort zone I say our comfort zone because I'm certainly by no means a foodie or anything like that if someone's going to try and certainly someone exotic\nChances are I don't want it I'd rather have more state what do you want with your steak more steak you know I Am a meat and potatoes born and raised Nebraska kid\nSo if someone says oh here's something like duck like we had duck this Tuesday night at Baylor Rosen done deal was a little leery of duck I don't know that I ever had ducked\nUh we had some and some duck ... feet at a few of these gourmet clubs over the years so that was like a side dish she was a couple of bites of something I didn't know if I wanted the main course to be duck\nOnce I had the duck I started looking around to see if anyone else was going to eat all their duck and I started eating off their plates it was so good and it has to do with the way as prepared obviously and this was fantastic us so we had some interesting things over the years that these events but I used to joke\nThat I'm not going to stop\nUntil we have one of these Moore may clubs that features as its main course kangaroo may\nSay we we want to do things that are a little strange and strange location sometimes I Want to eat kangaroo sometime I always said that as a joke I figured you know someone somewhere on the Australian Bush occasionally jumped on a kangaroo for some reason I don't know people do weird things I didn't know it was an actual thing you can eat\nUntil they called me\nFrom the three sixty steakhouse atop the horseshoe casino in Council Bluffs this was gee is five years or so ago\nHe said I hear your joke about the kangaroo you know we could do that\nAnd I felt like suddenly I was in like one of these really secretive conversations like hey you need a pinky toe I Know a guy I got I got to a guy and get your pinky toe and there's your nineties movie reference for this segment of the radio program\nLucy what probably wouldn't get that one you know it was like hey you need you need some intercontinental ballistic missiles I Know a guy you know suddenly I felt like I was on one of those conversations like hey you want to make a a journalist disappear\nUh I Know I Know a government you know that kind of thing so I started getting all like west very on the phone going really you think you can\nGet some kangaroo like should we tell people I mean is it illegal he goes no it's not it's not illegal it's\nIt's actually considered a delicacy and is one of my favorite things to eat I said well we we have to do this I mean the sheer novelty of it and maybe we have some emails for the people to eat so they have a couple of bites a kangaroo and then given something that you know actually good he goes no\nYou're going to be surprised how good this is\nSo we get to that gourmet club\nAt a three sixty sake house and the anticipation is building throughout the night everyone knows we're going to have kangaroo no one knows how they're going to react to this thing and especially me\nSo they put it in front of me I don't know I may be expected it to be like the presentation from a Christmas Story where they put the duck in front of the family with their heads still on it\nI expected to see like a pouch I don't know something a tale sticking out I don't know I had also I've been thinking about this for four weeks by the time it was finally foot in front of me and and my imagination had gone crazy\nBut as it turns out it was\nA little medallions of cut and and perfectly prepared meat\nAnd I hunger really put a bite of kangaroo in my mouth and I I I ...\nLike a champ and ... and you know what people were looking at me and said well how is it tastes like chicken I said no it tastes like kangaroo this is the best kangaroo I've ever had\nOf course it was the only kangaroo I ever had and it was delicious it had the flavor of a really good qualities steak or maybe a pork chop and kind of had the consistency of venison\nThat it was fantastic ... and and and same thing like with the duct tape it or not I I ... it all up and I started looking around is anyone knock and eat the kangaroo I have some it was\nAwesome it was so good and I never realized that it's it's actually something that people eat and\nI've been looking forward to the next time I can have kangaroo it was good\nThank you very much for coming by thanks good to see it coming by like I don't want to hear Scott you got any free stuff you know hey we're here for that too um so we don't have any kangaroo to serve a new one today so I'm here to tell you from personal experience and I don't know how many people can say this I have eaten kangaroo I have enjoyed kangaroo\nThere's nothing on healthy about kangaroo\nIt's not like they put a tail in front of you and say born EPA deeds you know you know they don't serve you a a chili out of uh the marsupial pouch it's meat at it's\nAwesome there's nothing on healthier dangerous about it and the fact that there is some parents who are flipping out out and Potter Dix schools in the panhandle of Nebraska because they're little kids age some kangaroo and and the ... the line in the school that is the story about this as some of the students at a western Nebraska high school and junior high\nMay have fallen ill\nAfter consuming chili with kangaroo made mixed with beef last week if they fell ill it's only because some of them are like oh gross oh no I Can't believe you know there was no there's nothing about it\nThat would cost me want to get sick unless it wasn't prepared right and that should be the issue here whether the meal was prepared correctly whether the meat was cooked\nUp but that doesn't seem to be the issue that seems to be that he fed them kangaroo parents lost their minds about it they demanded some sort of frontier justice and now this guys out of a job and I don't understand why\nIf I had the money I Would hire him as my own personal chef\nAs it is the vending machine is currently fulfilling that role and I barely have the money for that\nSo sticking with the food news of the day and if you have\nAnything you'd like to add to this a bit of talk radio chilly

not sure how to express their grief and their solidarity with you what worked for you\nHonestly when you're put in that position you're just in such shock and I feel like the PIN wheels for Aspen movement\nDid so much for our family and that's kind of why we've always continued the PIN we'll tradition for him because when he was on life support um the day before his accident we ... the day of his accident we were in the yard putting around fourth of July pin wheels in the yard it was the day before Father's Day and\nHe kept moving the PIN wheels around the yard and our neighbors took those PIN wheels and basically ran with that for a movement to show support for our family and to hopefully have a different outcome for Aspen when when he was in the hospital and\nI feel like just something that simple such a small thing as a PIN we all just every time I see a PIN we'll even though I Know some people don't even know what that means to our family but it just gives me\nJust a wave of hope and comfort I guess and so it's it's not even anything that people need to do\nTo communicate sometimes that can be something as small as sending a card just saying you're in our prayers and that and I kept every single card and I tried to send a thank you know ... every single person I'm Still\nA lot to go because there were I don't even I Can't even remember the amount of different things that we received books and you know Bible and so many things have support that\nHonestly anything in terms of meals or or just anything as simple as a card honestly will provide some comfort to a family I feel like oriented for us anyway\nAllow me to refuse I mean I'm sure you've heard a lot of the last few years and that is I don't know how you do it\nI don't know how you've done it and

eighty fourth in between center and the interstate and also heavy on a hundred and eighty if in Pacific\nAnd I mean\nChildren's hospital has been near and dear to our hearts since aspens accident and the demand for these stuffed animals have increased unfortunately um but it provides such comfort to children and siblings of children who are dealing with\nIllness or some kind of a tragedy um we have not only given animals to children's but also to the rainbow house Ronald McDonald house in some other organizations around Omaha and\nThey need more and more and more so our goal of this year is to really step it up from what it span we've collected over three thousand in the past two years which I think is really amazing but we're really trying to put in a little extra push behind it this year and get even more I mean I Would love\nTo see over four thousand as Michael this year so\nWhat a sweeping to think about to do you know that's that's just adorable to think about here's a stuffed animal or just picked up in the store that doesn't have any personal meaning to me and you think about the journey that this little guy is going to go on for somebody else do you is this only knew stuffed animals\nThat's what we have received used stuffed animals in the past and I I Will say that those go to a great home we've given those to the ... house\nAnd to cope in on corn um so those do not I mean we would prefer new because of health issues with children's hospital in and the different first responders and things like that they need to be new but\nIf you have you stuffed animals I Will take them and gladly give them a new home\nTo you know other kids that can ... you know we we can get those other organizations\nBecause surely they're going to be some use stuffed animals that are always just our kids have a ton of stuffing animals you know we had a baby born everyone just brought stuffed animals we really we have no personal use for these and then I'm sure you have some stories and say this was mine when I was a kid helped me right so you know how do you turn that don't\nExactly we we we don't turn it down because there's they will go to good homes\nSo you said
