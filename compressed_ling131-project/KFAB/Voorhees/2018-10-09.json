not frustrated I think it's incredible watch that but you're talking about North Korea it's amazing the way the media who you're with the front [noise]\n[noise] so it's amazing the way the media says that you know for Haiti years they couldn't do a thing\nAnd I'm like what are we in three months of negotiation it's ridiculous or as I've said about a thousand times you know rocket flying you know missiles flying you know nuclear testing you have nuclear closings closing up different areas of North Korea\nAnd we're getting the remains back it's already started of our great heroes where we got our hostage just back and I didn't pay one point eight million dollars like the previous administration we got paid nothing\nUh but I have agreed to meet and I have agreed to spend time [noise]\nBut how long has it been since we're left Singapore was a three month or so\nAnd people say that's that's the media saying like how can we be negative let's see his son really well how can we be negative oh are you disappointed with the stresses I think the fetus amazing they have no nuclear test you have no rockets and we have a very good relationship with chairman Kim [noise] which is very important uh\nI like him he likes me the relationship is good [noise] um\nMy company on a very very good meeting I mean I spoke to him at length\nYesterday and he'll be coming back he'll be back [noise] tonight [noise] and so I mean just the opposite I think we've made incredible process I could be ... incredible beyond that I don't think there's some of the press I I missed some of the press really covers it accurately and right but uh some of the pressure really doesn't yes John\nDo you want to take this opportunity to tell us when your next to me\nWhile it is happening and we're we're setting that up right now that was part of the reason that Mike was going over to me ah they're setting up the meeting and\nWe'll be announcing that probably a different location Singapore was fantastic but will probably do a different location you're going to mar a Lago\n... he'd probably like that I'd like to I think it would be good to me that I Will say what we're talking about three or four different locations uh timing won't be too far away and we made a lot of progress at this meeting really is to you know people don't realize the importance of the first meeting I mean we set point number one the new\nFlavors Asia for some reason he presses and pick that up but that was actually pointing number one they've agreed to de list for his age\nAnd they continue to do today and they continue now we haven't removed sanctions as you know people say or what have we done rabbit removes thanks it's really a very big sanctions I'd love to remove them but we have to get something for doing it against\nUs or [noise] [noise]\nYou know I don't want to embarrass anybody by asking I think eventually we'll have flux of meetings on us soil and on their soil by the way it's just you know that's a two way street on their soil also\nI think that the country of North Korea is going to be a very successful country I think it's going to be incredibly economically successful [noise]\nAnd I want to make it that way I think it's going to be good other countries other people entrepreneurs banks or I Will tell you they're calling wanting to go there and wanting to invest at some point\nWhen German Kim makes that decision I think he's going to unleash something that's going to be spectacular really spectacular and I think he knows it and I think that's one of the reasons that we're having very successful conversations I think he wants to get on with the\nFirst one was yesterday [noise] she has been one of them\n[noise] when\n[noise]\nI Would say will name a successor within the next two or three which [noise]\nMaybe sooner rather have used to listen to the topic\nBut I Will be [noise] and so forth\nI Know nothing right now I Know what everybody else does stuff just\nWhat's your response to Hillary Clinton saying last night where a judge Kavanaugh\nI guess that's why she lost she doesn't get it [noise] she never did I knew that a long time\nAgo Hillary never got it and that's why she lost [noise] anything else\nSort of measurements are and where we what if you're a producer run out of the view of the outer stamina out on the campaign I think\nWe're going to do well when you people would say I guess if you saw there was a a five percent drop off you say there's something wrong with the president you would say but now I'm going to Iowa tonight we have a big big craft or make a big announcement denied by the way in Iowa [noise] uh [noise] we'll be back in a very big announcement and\n[noise] I have to say the farmers\nAre so thrilled with the U.S embassy a\nNew agreement I don't use the word NAFTA because NAFTA was a disaster for our country and after we lost millions and millions of jobs for thousands and thousands in\nFactories and plants and the bad for farmers you what happened to talk of farmers over the last Fifteen Years only gone down now they got to go up we just opened up Mexico we just opened up to Canada\nAnd it's great for farmers but I'm going to Iowa tonight and we'll be talking a little after an alternate I'd [noise] and\n[noise] got some great things play I'm speaking of\nThat I Will say if you look at industries the steel industry in this country is fact like nothing I've ever seen before in a period of six months since we started doing what I'm doing a the steel industry has a literally revived US Steel is opening up a plants\nNew Gore's open enough everybody is the steel industry in our in our country is really really hot so it's been it's really regret but I'll be going to Iowa to die\nFrom has [noise] how\nVery well ... very well we have a very good relationship with China but you know they took out five hundred million out of our country for many years each year\nAre we just can't let that happen this year has been talked about five people in this chair for many years before for years and years they would take it out two hundred three hundred four hundred and even five hundred million dollars a year [noise]\nWe help you rebuild China if we don't do that China's not where they are right down and that's fine with me but we were not doing it any longer\nFrom her hotel oh sure absolutely are you going to go for a hundred\nPercent if they do that if they retaliate what does retaliate they've already retaliated they take it out of five hundred million dollars that's I think that's the ultimate retaliation now look John and wants to make a deal\nAnd I say they're not ready yet I just say that are running and we've canceled a couple of meetings because I just say they're not ready to make a deal we can't have a one way street it's got to be a two way street it's been a one way street for twenty five years\nWe've got to make it a two way street we've got a benefit also [noise]\nThank you have any other
