regarding school this morning one day after Fifteen year old girl was stabbed or sixteen year old is he lived in stabbed himself today to low bleach cruiser was stationed right outside the front door the school to students are recovering from their wounds at last report they were in stable condition\nAre they exactly one in the same if you support the president you can't possibly support women and you say what about the number of women who uh who support this president they don't matter they don't support women they're not feminine enough for you\nI look at this and I say it doesn't matter the economy is going well stuff is getting done all the people who said before the the president was inaugurated the economy is going to attack the wall street is going to crash we're going to have war\nNone of these things are happening in fact the economy is going great Wall Street is going up a we have a piece now where we've lasting eh we're on the creation of but hopefully lasting peace\nWith the places like North Korea and China and and even potentially in the middle east and people said if you and now you're going to move the U.S embassy in Jerusalem there's going to be a huge war where is this war [noise]\nIt is you're supposed to be going on now for what six months since president made the announcement is not happening\nNow the the the the doomsday or is out there who just keeps saying oh boy this is this going to be this can be as bad as a ... was with that said it it doesn't happen so when presented with facts supported by evidence many choose not to believe these facts\nThe way that it's being spun though is that this is on conservatives\nEven when presented with scientific evidence that there is global warming conservatives still don't believe I don't I don't know how you can say that with a straight face\nI've always said and I and I've had very few people disagree with me\nThat I I'm not sure I'm not a scientist I I don't know if there's global warming if there is manmade global warming or not and the things that they generally asked me to do is turn off the lights when I leave the room done\nUh I I Try and drive a fuel efficient car 'cause I like saving money done\nOr make sure your tires are properly inflated to get the best gas mileage okay this makes sense this makes me money what else am I supposed to do our recycle we have to recycling bins vorhees villas because we recycle so much\nWhat do you want me to do when nations in when the Obama administration talked about manmade global warming their idea was we need to start collecting a whole bunch of money\nAnd we need to set some pretty stringent regulations that aren't going to take effect until all of us have left office\n\nFifteen Twenty years down the line we start collecting the money now\nBut all of those regulations we need to combat global warming we're not going to start those for Fifteen to Twenty years now wait a second that doesn't sound like a solution to combat global warming that sounds like a solution to make money for government to take money from private business and fuel it into a governmental economy well doing nothing with it\nThat doesn't sound like a solution for the problem that you present it so what is it that you're actually asking people to do it's not that the scientific evidence people just choose not to believe it what do you want me to do about this what should be done everything that they talked about ends up making a whole bunch of money for government\nAnd that causes me to look at it with a bit of a\nA a jaundiced eye towards what they're asking for the University of Iowa or researchers look at this even when presented with facts supported by evidence many choose not to believe them and they've twisted this into noting quote research suggests\nBenefits of diversifying the labor force or promoting women or minorities into leadership\n... is likely to threaten the vested interests of members of currently over represented groups\nLet me put that in layman's terms\nFat wealthy conservative white guys are threatened by when presented the scientific evidence of the benefits of diversifying the labor force that fat old conservative white guys are threatened by minorities and women hiring\nThem promoting them working with them\nAgain where where is what what is this evidence you're talking about\nWhat just this now this research that they put out there and say people don't believe facts\nNo matter how you present the evidence if they choose not to believe them then it's not true and they they don't they just don't want to to believe this what they've done here and twisting the evidence to make it look like conservatives only conservatives are the ones who don't believe the truth\nIs is exactly\nWhat I mean it's proving what they're trying\nTo the point they're trying to make except they don't see it this is let me put it a little more simply this is the same\nGroup of people who say we need to have tolerance oh well let me give you my political opinion note your political opinion is not tolerant but wait who decides what tolerance is we do we're the tolerant ones but you're being intolerant of my opinion that's because your opinions not tolerant\nIt's the same thing here\nYou choose not to believe facts even when presented with evidence or I'm presenting you at this evidence and I'm Wondering about why you don't believe this set of facts the those aren't facts ... you're ... you're obviously not getting this you're blind to the research that's being presented\nHere's another example there is an actress\nWho I guess she used to being a TV show and she was married to Ben Affleck and now I think the only job she gets is doing a those capital one commercials or Jennifer Garner\n\nShe was talking at a group called\nHad I'm Sorry to use this term is is the name of the organization the rape foundation they had a brunch on Sunday or it sounds delightful right so she's up there and she says we need to change this culture this anti woman were the norm of sexual assault\nIs a a crime committed with impunity in this country we need to change this culture\nNow when they're talking about changing the culture this this rape culture in America there looking at the president if they're looking at Brett Kavanaugh they're looking at conservatives what do they not looking at they're not looking at rap music and Hollywood two blocks that are completely disrespectful to women especially rap culture\nAnd two cultures that are completely celebrated by the left in this country\nNow I kept resent that evidence aspect here a bunch of rap artist in Hollywood movie stars and directors and so forth who have promoted the culture that you say is awful and apparently one sided coming from Trump Kavanaugh and their supporters and people they they they don't\nLook at that evidence they that doesn't comport with what they want to believe\n\nThat taken a step further here's an accusation from an actress busy Philip she's the one we talked about her the other day she went on Ellen DeGeneres and got Ellen to open up a bus that happened to her when she was a teenager this actress from the TV show freaks and geeks says she was filming the show with James Franco\nAnd said he uh attacked me he assaulted me what is the accusation she says he'd grab both my arms and screamed in my face don't ever touch me again and he threw me to the ground flat on my back window knocked out on me\nHe was a bully throughout the experience and he was barely even punishment and they just they kind of gave 'em a slap on the wrist and said please don't act like that\nNow\nThis is going to be a bit of a controversial statement I'm sure if James Franco does this you know grab someone by the arms screams don't touch me again throws this person on the ground and does this to a male co star do we hear about this\nI thought we needed to I mean there are no genders anymore right we need to treat everyone equally right women do not need to be taken care of by men you don't need to treat us differently\nYou treat us exactly the same so if if James Franco does this to a male co star and we don't hear about it why is it a salt if he does it to this actress and and by the way let me point out\nYou should never treat a woman like this\nI'm using their argument that women should be treated exactly the same as men whether it's hiring firing promotion\nActing uh\nYou you don't need to be chivalry is we don't want that kind of thing don't compliment how I look I Am not here for your aesthetic amusement don't get the door for me\nThat you don't even propose marriage to me if I Want to marry you I'll ask you to do it are there are no male and female bathrooms or gender roles anymore we're throwing it all out so James Franco treats her the way that I'm sure he's probably three and a lot of guys and suddenly we got a big flipping deal\nIf he does this to a guy no one talks about it now why based on their argument that this world should be gender lists why is this different\nEmbassy suite swimming is a registered to attend triple A. dot com\nSlash terms and
