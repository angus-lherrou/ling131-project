whole series of vignettes where every scene you're not quite sure which way it's going to go you just know that is probably going to be pretty deprived and I feel\nSo a uncomfortable watching it the whole time I'm watching it I just feel uncomfortable and for some reason I like it\nI Know the reason you uncomfortable why because it's the same one the same reason that I couldn't watch it it's the kids when you watch kids making these horrendous horrible decisions and I think he has any teenagers yeah\nAnd there's nothing really that you can do about it because they're so stupid in Egypt are so dumb thing that was a\nMinor real smart so it was a minor season one storyline those really gone by the wayside oh second half of the of season one that really wasn't an issue anymore nor is it now
