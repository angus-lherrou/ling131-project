honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA Andy NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nCalls us embassy a sort of just worth [noise] em [noise]\nBe the name I guess that Ninety nine percent of the time we'll be hearing us MCA has a good ring to it I have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that with Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money\nAt the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four auto jobs lost about twenty five percent of our order jobs even more than that [noise] throughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise but for twenty five years as a civilian as a businessman I used to say how could anybody have signed a deal like NAFTA and I've watched\nNew England and so many other places where I was uh just the factories were leaving the jobs while leaving people were being fired and uh we can't have that [noise]\nSo we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and trade because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations all over the world that we're changing that\nWould just signed that much better deal with South Korea we had a horrible horrible deal and we just signed up at the United nations and that's worked out well and they're happy we're happy it's good for jobs good for a lot of things when that deal with side they said two hundred and fifty thousand jobs\nWe also provide brand new intellectual property protections for biologic drugs which will make North America a haven for medical innovation and develop and we want our drugs should be made here when you talk prescription drugs we don't like\nGetting them from foreign countries we don't know what's happening with those drugs how they're being made to important\nThis landmark agreement will send cash in jobs pouring into the United\nStates and into North America good for Canada good from Mexico instead of jobs leaving for overseas they will be returning back home and we've already had a we have many many car companies I was with prime minister of Japan he said\nWe have sent many car companies to the United states over the last year and a half it's true and big expansions and very importantly he said many more are coming\nBecause they have an incentive now to be here people want to be back in the United states again as I say the United states is respected again but it's also respected as to trade and industry this is a truly extraordinary agreement for the United states Canada and Mexico [noise]\nPresident Pena Nieto is so important\nThe president and I have developed a\nThis sort of a bond bond on trade\nMania Nieto a man that has done a very good job for\nIn terms of trade and prime minister Trudeau who just spoke to just spoke to both of them a little while ago they loved their countries they want to do right for their countries and that's what they've done and we've really formed if you look at this agreement before the great partnership with Mexico and with Canada\nAnd I plan to sign the agreement by the end of November by then we'll submitted for approval to Congress where in theory there should be no trouble but anything you submit to Congress has trouble or no matter what\nThe single greatest agreement oversight they'll say well you know drop likes it therefore we're not going to approve it is that would be good for the Republican\nSo therefore we can't support of it [noise] but it will be a scent that Congress pursue it to the trade promotion authority act\nDisagreement follows on the heels of our successful completion of a new and balance trade deal with South Korea tremendous difference in that deal from what it was it was a disaster as I said to improve the old deal\nThat it kills so many jobs it also follow us on our announcement last week of a new trade negotiation with Japan\nJapan would never negotiate with the United states they say we're not going to negotiate they told the previous administration we're not going to negotiate\nI said you don't have to negotiate but we're going to put a very very substantial tax on your car out\nBy the way without tariffs we wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs that includes Congress oh please don't charge tariffs without tariffs you wouldn't be\nWe wouldn't be standing here I can tell you Bob and all of these votes would not be standing here right now and we're totally prepared to do that if they don't negotiate but Japan is a wanting to negotiate\nSlowly they called about three weeks ago and\nHe's a terrific man the terrific just had a tremendous victory and uh they said we'd like to start negotiations immediately India which is the tariffs king they called us and they say we want to start negotiations immediately when Bob Lighthizer said\nWhat happened he would never\nDo this they said no we want to keep your presidents happy is so nice and then that is\nTrue that they keep us happy because they understand that were wise to what's been happening Indian charges tariffs of a hundred percent and then if we want to put a tariff us twenty five percent on people will go from Congress but that's not free trade and I look back to people that say where did these people come from where do they come from\nSo because of the power of terrorists and the power that we have with terrorists\nWe in many cases won't even have to use them\nThat's how powerful they are and how good they are\nBut in many cases were not going to have to use them and many in many cases are countries that are charging massive terrorists or eliminating those serves as you know we have two hundred and fifty million dollars at twenty five percent interest with China right now\nAnd we could go two hundred and sixty seven billion dollars more\nAnd China wants to talk very badly and I said frankly it's too early to talk can talk now because they're not ready because they'd been ripping those for so many years it doesn't happen that quickly and politically people force it too quickly you're not going to make the right deal for workers\nAnd for our country but China wants to talk and we want to talk to them and we want them to help us with North Korea we want them to continue to help us with North Korea that's very important [noise] the European Union\nIt's been very tough on the United states last year and for many years they've lost\nIn the vicinity of a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year they have massive trade barriers\nThey didn't want to come they didn't want to talk to John Claude great business person head of the European Union ... my friend\nI'd say blood we want to make a deal he goes no no no we're very happy I said you may be happy but I'm not happy because we have one of the worst deals of any group we have one of the worst deals with the European Union\nThey just didn't want to come because they were happy with the deal is up but were not happy with the deal and finally after\nYou know going through a whole process I said look we're just going to put a tax of twenty percent on all of the millions of Mercedes and BMWs all of the cars the millions and millions of cars that they sell here that they won't take over their\nFarm products that they won't take over there because there are barriers against self ... you're not allowed to our farmers aren't allowed to sell over there many of their products much of their products most of them and\nSo I announce that we're going to put a twenty percent tariffs could be twenty five on their cars coming in and uh they immediately called and said we'd like to start negotiations and we're having a successful negotiators you will see what happens who knows I always say who knows but we'll see I have a feeling will be successful [noise]\nA pillar of national security is economic security and trade\nNational security is not where we lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year over the last five years we've averaged eight hundred billion dollars a year loss on trade\nHow dumb is eight hundred billion dollars this group doesn't know about those numbers I don't even want to hear the snow [noise]\nThe United states it a trade deal has lost\nOn average almost eight hundred billion dollars a year that's dealing with China dealing with European Union ... when everybody Japan Mexico Canada everybody\nWe're not going to
