I don't know maybe he is a but I bet he was the president would say the same thing in a personal cell phone call or to the president of Russia's base or on Twitter or at a make America great again rally or in an interview with Fox Business that\nHe would in one of these personal phone calls I don't get the sense that there's a lot there that he he wouldn't want to reveal\nUm [noise] so that's the kind of thing the president's talking about this this is I don't know that it's fake news but the New York times quotes anonymous sources and everyone else picks it up like yeah this is the gospel truth this is exactly what's happening intelligence officials said so no they didn't\nAnd this is common place anymore now back to the mail bombs what is there what potentially is there that could

B. thaw and I heard radio station [noise]\nThree more packages intercepted this morning I'm Dave Anthony Fox News to in Delaware and one in New York making it tends suspicious packages all looking at the same mailed the Democrats talks as tiny Jay powers live here in New York City\nThat's what I'm curious about but I said a few minutes ago I was going to talk about sticking up for sex offenders and I should probably do that because\nI Am pleased yeah because I Am I'm looking forward to this every sex offender listening\nAs like it's about time you know someone's got to stick up for us\nThe mayor of grove town Georgia\nHas just instituted a policy because this is something that comes up every year at this time there's always a news story that says\nYou know there are sex offenders in your neighborhood so watch out for those kids when they're going trick or treating door to door ah I don't I don't know and I'm not saying that's never happened I I just I don't know I don't think\nThat I I've ever heard a story and I've been doing this radio thing\n... years this doesn't Nineteen twenty two years and I don't remember hearing a single story and all that time of yep my kid went up to a to ring the doorbell at home\nAnd and then she was gone you know it turns out it was a sex offender and even though he'd been you know getting up and asked her in the door all night he he looked at this kid dressed as a pirate and so this is the one for me and dragged him into the house\nI've never and it was a registered sex offender if I'd only known that this is where he lived then I wouldn't let my kid go trick or treating their someone needs to do some serious reporting about this kind of thing and let us know how dangerous these people are and where they live\nHave you ever heard that story I got to say I have not registered sex offender out on out of jail out on parole or whatever lives in the neighborhood just grabs a kid on Halloween never heard that\nNot on Halloween I Believe that we hear stories that they are implicated in oh sure yeah I'm not saying these guys are states or anything\nLike that but there's always a story around Halloween about these guys you know here check this website find out where they live\nAnd the mayor of growth town Georgia's taking it a step further he wants to round them all up he's got thirty parole sex offenders in his town [noise] I don't know how\nBig a town grove town Georgia is I mean there's ... I think it'd be really funny this is a town like fifty seven people study of ...\n... yeah girls can yeah I don't know maybe it's a you know big thriving metropolis in the Atlanta never heard of yeah well I mean it could be a suburb of Atlanta I don't know you look it up you get back to me on that thank you very much Lucy\nOr they'd be funny if a small town like half the town with sex offenders why wouldn't they just defend on each other hobby elation fourteen thousand\nOkay All right so this is a ... small well yeah but it's it's not like thirty not like eighty two people small\nSo they got thirty\nParoled sex offenders and the mayor wants to round them up what does he want to do next Wednesday as kids are trick or treating in the evening he wants to have 'em all come down to city hall and like hang out and watch TV or shoot pool or something\nAnd I'm sticking up for the sex offenders you can't do that and here's here's why I've never been a fan of this\nSex offender registry if these people are so dangerous that I Need to know where they are then I should know where they are if they're dangerous people I should know exactly where they are they should be in jail\nThey shouldn't be living up the hill from me they shouldn't be down the street around the corner three doors down across the street\nNow I don't I don't want them there if they're dangerous and I have to keep a watchful eye over my kids but so these guys don't grab him then I wouldn't like I don't want my kid's trick or treating around scary offenders\nThat's why we don't go trick or treating at the county jail\nOh I got another shift\nAlready got one of the oh I got some uh some ... some jail a whiskey there was a maid in a toilet this is good Gail kc what's jail cake and it's got honey buns in it\n[laughter] I Know honey buns [laughter] every jails you got to got any money by oh my goodness you're right yeah so I don't take my kid's trick or treating at the county jail that's just something\nThat I personally don't do that to the stand I took a long time ago my wife's on board I didn't have to talk her into it she agreed now I I was ready to put my foot down this could be a deal breaker or but she was right on board is all you know what you're right and we're not going to do that so if these people are dangerous\nThan they should still be in jail and if they're not dangerous if they ... and here if you're thinking why are you sticking up for sex offenders noticed this story every year has to do with sex offenders it never has to do with murderers you could be a guy who went to jail for fifty eight years\nBecause you ate a guy's liver with some ... beans and a nice key auntie and then they let you out\nYou on a registry no you're just living down at forty seven oh five you know main street you're just you're down there you know ... there's no there's no registry for these sick nut job weirdos it's all it's it's this particular brand nut job weirdos we have a registry for\nAnd we have to know where they are I I'm busy I don't I don't have the time and do a map but my neighborhood and find out where the weirdos are\nYou should know your law enforcement if they're dangerous keep them in jail and if they if they've served their time and they've been released from prison that I'm gonna have to assume and hope that they're no longer dangerous and they paid their debt to society\nIn which case you need to leave these people alone and hopefully they don't add to the recidivism rate and go out there and break\nThe law again especially with talking about these crimes\nSo this mayor wants to go round round them up and have them hang out at city hall\nI hate to know what\nHe's using for bait well is that even legal I mean they can they know right I don't they're not under parole or probation\nWhich presumably not all of them what he\nThe mayor his name is Gary Jones and he says the plans necessary to ensure the safety of our children\nUm the Washington Post says there's no evidence that children are more likely to be targeted by sexual predators on Halloween than any other night of the year well that's a nice argument you know hey you got to take my kid on Halloween well no more than I Would on any other day oh since put it that way\nYou know what a what a great argument in their favor and there have been no incidents in the area but he says uh that he can do it he says it's legal\nThat are these are sex offenders on probation and he says there are required to be present from six to nine pm on Wednesday\nThis force gathering of all local sex offenders I I Would not want to be a fly on the wall for those conversations\nEngland they're all going to learn from each other\nAnd anyone who's going to send me an email with the words Brett Kavanaugh and ... you just stop and send it to somebody else they weren't going to now they will\n[laughter] nice skill\nOr you know Trump Donald J all of that magazine you leave that offer yourself\nOh that reminds me do I still have the story\nThere was a guy who was a grabbing a woman on an airplane just a few days ago and then you know they land in and they dragged him off the plane and his argument was I should be able to grab this woman in the seat in front of me he was reaching between the seeds and just and just you know honk and the horn on the a woman\nOur own I'm In ... yeah it was just reaching through in how you doing and like she's not going to like who did that you know\nAnd then she turns around and he's looking the other way I Do know is that guy behind me it was Mr tickle he's seven rows back there he's got these long weekly arms so it was pretty obvious to everybody around it was pretty obvious to everyone around who was doing this so they land they move her first of all then they land\nAnd in law enforcement's dragging this guy off the plane and his argument was\nThe president says we can do this to women president says we can grab and whenever they want so they're dragging this more on off a plane and he's saying the president says we can grab women so therefore I get to grab women\nAnd you're telling me that this kind of mindset is not the same one that would mail pipe bombs to themselves several variations of the team that President Trump is made the Democrats so insane there now mailing bombs to themselves\n\nAh looking here at the latest on this story though that no one else has been mailed a pipe bomb with Robert De Niro someone sent one to his restaurant\n\nSo I mean the food that bad I don't I don't think that was the case um\nSo I'm looking here to see if there's a need to get back in the mail by I don't want to stray too far from it but I also don't want to dwell on it any more than I already have so\nMoving here next we've got a state senator in Nebraska\nWho is proposing an amendment next year that would allow sixteen year old's the ability to vote in our state I Will give
