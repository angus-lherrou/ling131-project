A. V. with Lucy Jasmine I'm Scott vorhees thank you very much for joining us here\nThis morning as we welcome into the studio in Nebraska as a second district congressman federal done ... this morning good to have you here thanks a lot for coming in philosophy here\nYou know it just happened to have a ... and it's it's not a an incredible coincidence because that airs quite a bit on this radio station this commercial from this group called with honor that they like you an awful lot\nAh we were just talking here that that commercial you know General John begun you know with the music and all that kind of makes it reminds me of the old GI Joe TV commercials when I was a kid\nYou know is there an action figure coming out of you or something\nI sure hope not [laughter] so that's a separate GI Joe commercials to its way back were date or solve death says well I think you're GI Joes might've been a little taller than mine but not much not much not that much older than I Am well it's\nIt's good to have you here you've got to be pretty uh honored by this group and other veterans groups coming down support and you're like\nWell some of it it you can't coordinate so you don't know if they're going to do an ad or not but they did I Would say like five or six months ago I met with them and they ... they were interested in my military background in service but they also\nA very focused on civility and they're trying to find people that are willing to work across the aisle not bash each other so that sort of this group's focus area and I I Believe in that I mean I think the veterans in Congress by the way of my best friends on the Democratic side of the aisle are veterans and we are\nCommitted to want to do good things for our country not beat each other up and things like that so I think a civility is very important I've done maybe four hundred doors down last week and a half I think that's the number one topic\nOh we're tired of people screaming at each other I appreciate your commercials you gotta smiley or not beaten up on your opponent and things like that so I think they can either paying yeah well you know there's got to have a little fun at this age\nWell there there is another advertisement I don't remember which group has it out here that refers to car at ease when your opponent in this congressional race and uh her ilk as that angry left wing democratic mob or something like that or does this Kara Eastman strike you as the leader of a mob\nOr I Would say no for an eye on that and that's not my ad and again you don't coordinate outside groups come in on both ... on the Democrats and Republicans on this stuff and I I think it's a overall not a healthy thing but I Would say those are my opponent during the debates talks about the treasonous\nDonald Trump and the un American us and immoral that and I think that that's going too far it's All right to critique the president I have I don't think I'd like his press conference with\nWho I I thought that he was not a target with that and I critique debt and criticized but say treasonous on American Idol I don't think we have too much of that Washington right now I think we it's hard to criticize\nBut I think the other side of the aisle particularly but some other Republicans do uh to go too far when you start attacking the character the morality the patriotism I I think we can disagree about her way and I think so I think during the debates\nMultiple Times She's gone way too far away when you call the other folks on the other side of the aisle treasonous that's not what Americans need that's not what this district watch us we have too much of that Washington right now\nYeah the issue of health care is one during last night's debate that to you and your challenger talked about was some level of agreement to she says she she talks to many families\nWho have to choose between healthcare for their family or food on their plate and your response I thought was pretty interesting you said I agree with her that's just prove that this Affordable Care act\nOtherwise known as Obamacare\nIsn't working um I look though at the majority that you guys the Republicans have had in the house of representatives these last two years and there were a lot of campaign promises were going to do something about Obamacare we're going to do nothing's been done about it you know how how is this next couple of years going to be any different if you guys retain the house\nWe need rule of law at so and the folks come here they need to be detained and you cannot just released some uh like we've been doing for years because many of them the disappear so we need rule of law and I that's what I Would support a supporter president to secure our border\nPresident said last night at this rally in in Texas that he felt the Democrats were behind this migrant caravan ... where do you think this comes from\nI have no idea but I think it they are exploiting our weakness right now we don't have we were divided and we couldn't get to the Congress to move forward there was no compromise and on this particular issue\nRepublicans do because they have to give a little bit so we can move forward we need\nA physical security border patrol says we need seven hundred miles\nOf wall and I think the ethic they're right because we suddenly immigration issue you have al Qaida and ISIS which we have captured and to countries along the route in Central America have captured some\nUh Guatemala his forty in custody believe it or not the sort of a of a publicly

morning it's general chew on Terry what he news radio eleven ten KFC be in ... county\nCharges are being considered it gives an overhaul manic ... with a double fatal crash that happened Sunday night on highway Seventy five near the brass city fifty four year old Rickey Anthony was found later on in ... city and\nOr if it follows the patterns of the previous caravans could shrink by\nA lot before reaching the U.S border with some people turning back going off on their own or deciding to try to stay in Mexico\nPresident Trump blamed Guatemala he blamed Honduras he blamed El Salvador for not stopping it and says we will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them\nNow of course Democrats look at this and say yeah this this is great we have countries now in in desperate need of assistance from America that's why people are fleeing from there and the president's going to cut it off as he think this is going to lead to more people trying to get into this country or less\nI think you can also that's a good question I think it also asked the question if we've been giving substantial massive foreign aid to these countries and others why are there are countries is still places that are that people want to flee by the thousands\nThat's a good question we give you this money what happens to it\nWere never allowed to ask that question were never allowed to ask why these these drug lords and and regional dictators and and and murderers are allowed to get more wealth more power more weapons more drugs more children sold into slavery\nAnd the government can't fix bridges and roads down there and nor is there any kind of infrastructure\nOr any kind of a new jobs building program for these countries the bad guys get all the money and the good people want to get out of there and we still keep given all the money down there as this continues to happen every time\nNow I don't know if if cutting off the aid is the right way or if continuing the aid is the right thing to do it seems to me is I look at the thousands and thousands of people\nWho are coming up here I see a lot of able bodied good strong young men every picture is just chock full of a Central American boys males between the ages of say Seventeen and twenty seven\nI I'd venture a guess that of the seven thousand two hundred people that ... it looks like a good Seventy five percent are able bodied young men you know those who if they truly care about the country whose flag there toting as they make it towards America\nThat they might put down the flag pick up a firearm joined the nation's military and fight back against the drug lords take their country back\nSay All right what does America doing that were not what can we do here what can be done here\nIs it just because we're in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador or southern Mexico that suddenly are lot in life has decided and we can't get ahead we can't have nice things we can have jobs we can't have a strong economy we can have people submitting to the rule of law\nJust because we're in Central America\nThe reason why all those things happened is is because good people let them happen into fleet\nIs not the right answer let's look at this this way Omaha is overrun with drug lords and criminals and and and pimps prostitutes and and and all these scary people okay so\nMaybe we have a few more of them than we would prefer gang members and all the rest of it but I'm Talking like you can't drive to work\nWithout having to stop at some despot checkpoints set up by drug lords who are trying to extract money or whatever from you for the privilege of crossing through their territory that's what it looks like\nDown there and you can't get anywhere in Omaha with that you're like you know what I'm going to take the family to church and then we're going to go to first watch afterwards and by the time you make it to first watch your\nAbout three thousand dollars in one of your kids is gone sold into slavery and your nose is broken now what happens to you in that circumstance do you say you know this is not what I Want for this land of which I'm very proud\nWe need to fight back we good people we can do this we can fight back America will be willing to have you did we we'd have allies willing to help us fight back take back this territory\nIsn't that what you do or just just give up and leave\nIf all the people who would sooner give up and leave\nCome to this country so now we're talking about people who on some level are cowards if we're talking about able bodied young men who have the ability to do something and they've just\n... is Guatemala only able bodied young men 'cause I don't see them taking little sisters and mom and grandma and everyone else up there with him I see them just leaving I see I'm leaving behind probably a lot of family members who need their help\nSo now we have an influx of cowards come into this country that can be better or worse for America and the long run\nWouldn't use stay wouldn't you fight wouldn't you do everything possible to protect that what you love\nHow can these guys are doing it and how come we're just supposed to take it how come as bad for the president to say what's enforce the laws and do something about this\nNow speaking of criminals in our in our home to my hometown ... our town of Omaha\nOne of them was just taken off the streets now initially I saw the story and thought my gosh what a great name and I read a bit more about it and I got heartbroken and I'll share all these range of emotions with you
