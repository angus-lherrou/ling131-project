F. A. B.\nSo rappers and entertainers and and liberals and people are coming out and saying they want absolutely nothing to do with Kanye West anymore I'm you know what\nEven though I I I tend to be supportive of the president\nI don't agree with everything he's ever said done tweeted or anything like that but I I I tend to be very supportive because at at the heart of this man he's someone who fights back and I think that's what draws people\nMore to this president than anything else he does and and that is the fights back because so many people are tired of being called racist and sexist and homophobic and seen the fall of it can war mongering and they hate the poor\nAnd didn't want to kick puppies around and other people are tired\nOf being called that and you're supposed to just sit there and take it and apologize and be guilty and all the rest of the stuff when you when you're feeling I don't I don't feel like I have anything to apologize for I'd like to fight back the next thing you know I'm fighting with with friends on fighting on social medium fighting with family members are fighting with coworkers I'm just tired of all that so instead you just hang in your head and say well\nYou know maybe it's just best we don't get into it if President Trump fights back and people like that about him so even though for those reasons chief among the reasons why I liked the president\nI caution\nTo get too much on the bandwagon that Kanye West is put himself on\nAnd the reason for this this is pretty simple and that is Kanye West is crazy he is ... own nuts see is that who insane and I've only ever issued this warning one other time\nWhen there are people when Roseanne Barr has TV show came back and Roseanne was back on television or just last last year and people said oh it's great there's a character on TV who's border to the president Roseanne supportive of the president and I said yeah\nBut let's also not lose side of the fact that she's nuts she crazy\nShe says a lot of nutty crazy things as you said a lot of nutty crazy things throughout her entire life so maybe you know it's that speak that's great that she thinks these things now but before we jump fall into that at this bucket of nuts with Roseanne less be a little cautious about it and I was proven right on that\nAnd you wash that down with the freshest cup of coffee ... being the cup here the bookies roast house coffee at all Bucky is convenience store locations during the month of October I'm live in a different puppies every Friday last week it was at Seventy seven and dodge are here today at ... and twenty fourth in Council Bluffs\nNext week we'll be in ... and the elkhorn after after round out the month of October\nYesterday calling us was in the White House with President but his wife Kamkar dashing or she also was with members of the the Trump family she reunited with Alice Johnston that's the woman who\nSeveral decades ago I was involved in selling drugs and she got a life sentence for that\nWhich when you consider\nThat people who you know who to murder people don't get life sentences anymore it seemed a bit heavy handed and and everyone had been asked several presidents for the last few\nA terms of our commander in chief you gotta commute this woman sentence this is way crazy and no one did it and they were later it'll heart and President Obama to do it maybe because of the racial overtones of it she's black he's black so why wouldn't you take care of this whatever reason they never did um\nAnd then finally President Trump heard this from Kim car dashing they mad about it and he said you're right and commuted her sentence was commuted her life sentence\nSo Kim cart as she in reunited with this woman Alice Johnston yesterday at Google's headquarters\nWhich is interesting because if you've been following some of the news about stuff coming out from the Google executives were there ... you know threats and violence\nOn a on members of the Trump Administration their supporters and Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh seem like an interesting pick here because not only work him or dash in and Alice Johnston there but\nThey were joined by Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner who is an advisor to the president they were also there with I and I don't know why uh Jim Brown hall of fame running back\nAnd let's not forget it a fantastic actor I mean have you seen the dirty dozen so Jim Brown is there as well and they're all they're\nJust made a joined up parents with Google to discuss prison reform\nSo it was it was a big con you a card dashing in Trump love fast all across the er the media yesterday now this as ABC News is set to air tonight\nThis interview with first lady Maloney a Trump\nAnd they are given her

circumstances ask her this don't bring that up don't do any of that are so they're given her credit for that there was it was a\nNo question is off the table kind of thing\nBut I'm seeing here and

only going to be happy if if she walked into this interview and said I'm Glad you've given me this platform\nToday I'm announcing my separation from the president of the United states that's the only way they were going to be happy about this interview that's what they wanted to have happen they wanted her either to walk in and start the interview signing divorce papers or by the end of the interview in it you know lead up to and that's why I'm leaving\nThat that no good scum bags that's what they wanted\nTo have happen it didn't happen instead\nThe first lady of some of the clips they revealed\nHave said that uh I Love by my husband and I stand by him\nAnd uh we need to be really careful around some of the staff members at this White House they are not to be trusted\nAnd and people were like don't say that why would you say don't you know it don't you you're just you're just mounting things that your your husband told you to say because they think she's done\nNow the one thing that they they set out there is a teaser to try and make you think oh you know the oh yeah okay so this lady is not going to throw the president under the bus she's not going to leave him she is standing by her man\nBut you know just in case you started thinking that she was good uh she's not listen to what she said here about bullying because that's a big platform she's trying she's going around the country's going around the world trying to stop bullying from happening and so they asked her about that and her quote was that I Am the most bullied\nPerson in the world\nAnd interview a interviewer Tom Llamas said\nYou're really the most bullied person in the world and then she modified or ask are saying one of them\nIf you really see what people are saying about me and they put this clip out there to say how can this woman\nWho is a supermodel she's a super model and she's married to the most powerful man on the planet how can you possibly say that she's the most bully person in the world look honestly on some level I get that\n... after all as I said she's a supermodel she's married to the most powerful man in the world\nOr they're rich beyond their wildest dreams how in the ... that look I'm not saying that she doesn't have the means to guard a you know emotionally against the bullying she has received but that doesn't change the fact that she very well might be the most bullied person in the world\nWhen she goes on Twitter or with a statement is released or anything along these lines even if it's something like\nWe have to help out the children or please pray for the victims of this or that or or my goodness look at the atrocities with hurricane Michael those poor people in Florida\nThe first comments that come in on her Twitter feed\nOur all bullying comments you don't really care about them how can you claim to care about women and children when you stand by this president who wants women grow up in children shot how this these are the things that she gets on Twitter on an absolute minutely on a second lead basis it's all over\nTwitter I don't know how much of that she personally sees but if she ever takes a look at it she knows it's there because it's there\nNow is that not bullying\nAnd when she says she's the most bullied person in the world as you can see in this clip which again is right there posted if you're interested on the Scott vorhees page at ... dot com the interviewer ... says and I'm an expert and seen snark I you know I'm fluent in it\nOr the interviewer says you know it's interesting she says that\nSince her husband has been bowling people on Twitter for the better part of the last\nSeven years the guy's been all over there and even before that when he wasn't on Twitter was making fun of people's looks how they sound how they act\nWhat they feel he's been bullying people on Twitter for that is a whole life and before that he was bowling people in person you know I'll say this about President Trump yeah he does make comments about how people look what they say how they sound how they act\nMimics that mocks them\nAnd he's done that with everybody he's mocks man he's mocked women he's mocked conservatives he's ... liberals he's mocked news reports he's he's he's mock people on Fox News over the last few years he has an equal opportunity ...\nHe uh he is he's mocks it up pretty good every day against the number of people\nAnd you know if that's ... invest\nBowling um and I suppose on some level it is but this is also indicative of you know where the schools really missed when it comes to talking about bowling and they always address into don't bully people that kids bullied people adults bully people people bully people on social media happens over the place\nOr none of the emphasis is a white when you get bullied because it's probably going to happen to you here's what you can do about it\nHere's some ways of dealing with it here some ways of standing up for yourself\nBecause people love to bully someone who never stands out for him or herself or they don't talk about any of that\nSo you can see that clip on the Scott vorhees page K. F. A. B.\nDot com the first lady says she's the most bullied person in the world\nAnd you can see how deflated there's this ABC network in this in particular the interviewer is that she didn't either start or in the interview with I'm leaving the president of the United states that what that is what they want they want this couple to get a divorce\nNow as that's happening as we have now as of this past week\nA U.S Supreme Court justice we have a full Supreme Court they're fully stocked we have a full staff Supreme Court with the addition of Brett Kavanaugh but it's not over the opposition to justice Kavanaugh actually takes on a very strange\nRole or what's today on the so next weekend a week from tomorrow in New York City there's going to be um\nShall we say some some interesting public opposition to justice Kevin ... and I'll tell you what that is next Scott vorhees broadcasting live from ... convenience store in Council Bluffs just north of ... twenty fourth street here on news radio eleven ten K.
