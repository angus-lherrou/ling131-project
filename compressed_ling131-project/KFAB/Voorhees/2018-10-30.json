Bush went to Yankee Stadium throughout the first page before game three of the Yankees World Series\nHe was greeted with cheers and chance of usa that was about a month and a half after the September eleventh attacks what would happen in this country if a month and a half ago we were attacked and President Trump did anything do you think they will be greeted with cheers chance of usa\nOr would it just be more of the same here I I don't know I'm I'm so glad that we're not in a position to know to be honest with you because\nThere's nothing that this president doesn't know how you certainly he brings some of it on himself with with his incendiary commentary but there's nothing that is a done by this president that isn't greeted with disdain from the national news media and Google searches\nIt's the vice president who's taken flack for his choice of rabbi and an event last night he was at a campaign event and served suburban Detroit and\nWhen the vice president was their course stumping for local Republican candidates and all the rest is telling people that got to get out and vote for the midterm election next week\nHe wanted to have a local rabbi there to offer prayers for victims of the synagogue shooting Saturday in Pittsburgh and so we invited Rabbi Lawrence Jacobs to the stage at this event\nThe vice president invites a rabbi on stage to offer prayers for the Jewish victims of the synagogue attack on Saturday\nWas controversial about this oh my gosh do you even have to ask these questions everything is controversial about this the vice president picked the wrong rabbi\nAccording to the Washington Post and several people on Facebook they didn't like that Rabbi Lawrence Jacobs was invited now why is that because rabbi Jacobs is a messianic Jew\nWhich Jewish leaders consider a form of Christianity more than a form of Judaism\nAnd according to some of these\nIndividuals criticizing the choice of this particular Jew for this event someone said\nThere are more than sixty rabbis and the state directory and yet the only rabbi they could find to offer a prayer for the eleven Jewish victims in Pittsburgh at the Mike Pence rally was a local Jew for\nJesus rabbi that's pathetic that's one of these idiots on social media so apparently they they picked the wrong rabbi according to those who can't stand any thing\nOr members of his administration do so the president in the first lady will be going to Pittsburgh this afternoon\nAbout three o'clock Omaha Council Bluffs time to pay their respects this after democratic mayor of Pittsburgh built to do though said that Trump should ask the victim's family is if they want him to come\nAnd they should wait until the funerals are over there are two scheduled for today he said our attention and our focus is going to be on them and we don't have public safety that we can take away from what it is certainly needed in order to do both\n\nBut then CNN made the mistake of going and talking to a rabbi from the tree of life synagogue this is the one that was under attack on Saturday\nThey said do you want the president to come to Pittsburgh pay his respects\nAnd they've just salivating just waiting for the comments from this rabbi saying no this is anything from a distraction to a ... just absolutely disgusting\nActive a pure politics by this president this rabbi didn't say that rabbi Jeffrey Myers said on CNN that President is certainly welcome says I'm a citizen he's my president\n\nNow you're not hearing that promoted a whole lot today you know the the mayor of Pittsburgh says we don't want Trump here if the rabbi had said\nAnything along those lines it would be leading the national media it's not because he said the president has certainly welcome well that's that's inconvenient\nOr here's
