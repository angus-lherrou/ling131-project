history\nWell for the cowboy Walker had no success in Minnesota while the cowboys built their team up with players like Emmett Smith Russell Marilyn Kevin Smith and Darren ... stature\nI hard radio weekend sports time capsule maybe all\nI'm Dave Anthony Fox News this hurricane was an absolute monster and the damage that just wake is still yet to be fully understood and governor Rick Scott the morning after Michael was hit this morning Florida's Gulf Coast\nAnd they didn't want to because we knew so little about what happened we still don't know a whole heck of a lot but Douglas County attorney Don Klein did shoot down a couple of the rumors\nAbout what did or did not happen to work high school on Tuesday there was a rumor that the alarm the fire alarm was pulled at the school\nI don't know if the fire alarm went off at some point but whether it did or didn't it wasn't related to this situation the rumor was is that\nThe kid the boy was expelled or suspended he wasn't supposed to be at the school but he needed a way in there to go in and stabbed his ex girlfriend so his co conspirators pull the fire alarm so he could sneak in during all the confusion and pull out is\nNice for whatever he had an begin stabbing his ex girlfriend\nThat was the rumor\nDon clients that that's not the case the fire alarm was not pulled as a diversion for this situation again I don't know if the fire alarm went off at any point during the day but clients that had nothing to\nDo with this and that the student wasn't suspended so what did happen we've got two teenagers in serious condition and charges should\nFollow with the sixteen year old boy the ex boyfriend stabbing his Fifteen year old ex girlfriend at Burke high school on Tuesday he should be charged as\nAn adult very serious charges as an adult\nI I also would like to find out in the story why he wasn't able to or why he decided not to get a gun\nIf the accusation is is that it's so easy to get a firearm that during the vending machines all over the place because they're coming out of the drinking fountains anymore at all some kid needs to do is just tell someone I Need a gun like well what kind you know and and within minutes he's got firearms at his disposal\nAs someone who would go into the school that starts stabbing someone else's probably someone who would go in there and just start spraying bullets all over the place why didn't he get a gun why did he try and get a gun what happened here\nAnd what kind of student are we talking about amidst this hash tag be kind campaign artist students getting it in putting hash tag be kind\nAll over everything it's on the science that you see it\nGoing on to the football field and some of these schools to send the paraphernalia they got posters up the teachers are talking about it\nThen the news letters it's all it's stolen on a backpack it's taped on the lockers be kind to everybody you know why why did we start doing this why do we started this be kind campaign I dunno hashtags just started showing up seemed like a good idea let's be nice to be\nThis started because so many of these school shootings and violent incidents happen\nFrom someone who is a loner\nDotty or rebel sorry I I got into that eighties movie quote and I couldn't pull myself out I'm a loner doubting\nRebel what movie losing you know know that one year not that cool ... now it's not a good good guess but no uh that would be ... big adventure that never would have gotten that well we're watching it today [laughter]\nToyota a box of popcorn and we're going to watch ... big adventure\nThey started that whole campaign because these\nLoners these withdrawn kids\nWere the ones who are going and getting firearms and going in there and indiscriminately spraying bullets towards their classmates and faculty members [noise] so the whole campaign was started we need to be kind\nAnd but the ... just thrown out there with any follow up with without any follow through\nBe kind to whom well we can't profile yes you can here's a quote from a student named destiny who talked to K. MTV\nAction three news in the wake of what happened at Burke with her classmates she's a student there she said yeah the boy who allegedly did the stabbing is a classmate of mine quote\nI mean he seems sad like depressed but other than that I didn't expect that kind of violence from him\nHe kept to himself he didn't really talk to anybody he didn't really seem to have friends like that unquote\nWas anyone kind to this kid\nNow let me say two things out of both sides of my mouth at the exact same time [noise] number one I highly doubt it that anyone was kind of this kid when maybe all it would have taken from somebody is a little how's it going\nYou want to come over sit with us or you need a ride home from school\nOr you drop some here you go hey those shows I like those shoes or your hair looks cool today I don't know whenever people say to each other to make people feel good I've never tried it by understand some people do\nCould this young man maybe been turned around if someone at the school would ever said anything positive or nice to him\nThat's what that hash tag be kind thing is about to identify these students who are withdrawn sad depressed don't talk to anyone don't seem to have any friends\nSo that you don't have a some incident happened and then the students go talk to the media and say well yeah he was a quiet neighborhood you know that kind of a thing\nNow let me say something out of the other side of my mouth it's probably a reason why ... why people didn't want to talk to this kid which is the other side of the the blade that is this be kind campaign\nYou're essentially telling these students you know the kid over there is a loose cannon uh wing nuts someone who's just a one you know afraid not away from grabbing a weapon of some sort and\nPlunging it right through your rib cage gave him a hug I don't want to come on might help everybody out\nThere's probably in some cases and you're not supposed to say this so all say it there's a reason why some of these kids don't have any friends that people don't want to talk to them they're not they're not jobs maybe you shouldn't have been in the school in the first place\nIf this is the kind of mentality I was dating a girl\nEverything was going just hunky dory ... blended everything was just NATO and uh and then she moved on and I couldn't take it and so I thought I Know how to win her back I'll start sticking holes in her with this blade if\nThis is the kind of mentality this\nIs why you don't have a girlfriend this is why you don't have friends this is why people probably don't want to be kind to you\nSo all the onus is on the kittens ... the other students at the school to go find that withdrawn loner wearing the trench coat ... and I again I don't know anything about this particular kid\nBut all the onus is on the kids to go find those those not jobs who are just one bad hair day away from shooting up the school and go out there and you know give them a hug and say nice things to him and all but would it be great if they did that sure it would do I understand why they don't absolutely\nThe onus is not on the withdrawn depressed violent tendon feed them trying to turn that into some sort of past tense for 'em or a ... uh the the the onus is not on that particular kid with violent tendencies\nTo be better to not get all stabbing\n\nAnd that's why the hash tag ... kind thing doesn't work because the ... the the teachers and the and all the faculty members they just throw this whole big net on the entire student body and all the schools and say All right everyone be nice to each other\nRather than identifying that kid who would go up to the school in Parkland, Florida are going to Burke high school with a knife rather than identifying that one person and saying\nI don't want this kid in anywhere near the school he is dangerous he's going to hurt people maybe me\nWe need to get them out of fear we need to do something about that now they don't do that well that some sort of you know that's not being very nice that's not you know maybe you just aren't aren't approaching him in the right way I don't want to approach him at all I'm afraid he might stab me\n\nIt's not working it's it didn't work in Burke\nThankfully all they had was a knife\nAnd because I Can't help myself but say things like this the other problem of ... school is ah\nEvident in another quote from a different student in talking to action three news about this\nUh because the schools not saying anything the letter released by Omaha public school said they're not going to release any information while the police continue their investigation but the students were talking and one of them named uh he has a name so unique\nI won't give it on the radio so it's not to publicly embarrass him\nBut the students says quote\nI didn't think nobody would do nothing like that at our school unquote\n\nSays it does that mean that you did think that somebody would do something like that that's that's a triple negative\nI my if not qualified but [laughter] right my public school education at Ralston high school didn't prepare me for digesting something like that I didn't think nobody would do nothing like that at our school have you ever been to that school\nYou get your shoes in the beginning which people to follow the help and try and

where they're going there they were running around in traffic and some of these\nThese walkouts last school year that was in the wake of the Parkland school shooting and the students said was I think the best way to keep kids safe is to get up and walk out of school and into oncoming traffic\nWhich was the case with some of these protests the school said don't do it and then they said well we're going to allow them to do it we're not going to punish anyone for doing it many of the school said\nThis was defined as freedom of speech but now if\nStudents need to talk to each other about the school being put in a lockdown these kids were nervous is student is young people were nervous listening for gunshots wondering if someone was going to come through the door as soon as they instituted the lockdown Burke on Tuesday and you're saying don't talk about it\nJust pretend like it never even happened threatened with suspension\nOr Cory says wouldn't that be against their First Amendment

and rules that really wouldn't stand up in court like preventing what students talk about or\nAware when not offensive I thought the school said when the sports players note that they were allowed to

there's one more I wanted to re get Joyce emails and says\nThat anyone else noticed that the other day you said in Omaha public schools resource officer was fired because he had locked up Doug and the

ridiculous that's from Joyce ... dot com\n\nSo where we have a a we have a call into the school and the district for some response to the accusation now that students have Burke high school were threatened with suspension if they talk to each other about the school being locked down in one student's stabbing another student\nOr you know who's going to be in violation of this\nThat student we quoted in the news last hour who told action three news this a student whose name was so unique\nBy the way his name rhymes with unique um but it's not unique it's a unique name but his name is not
