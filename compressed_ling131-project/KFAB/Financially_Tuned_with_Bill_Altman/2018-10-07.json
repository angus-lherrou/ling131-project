the only bill you're you're like there's for bills they're now basic three bills inability absolutely rebuilds inability hey that sounds like the name of a a band or a movie that's right [laughter] three bills inability\nWell uh we're here with Bill Altman junior and bill you do a great job every week educating us on new things and speaking of new things\nA socially responsible portfolio uh this is a new concept to me I mean obviously we want companies that are going to do well and we want growth in our portfolios and this sounds like a unique opportunity to actually be responsible and uh get some good growing companies\nAbsolutely and it's a you know once again like a three legged stool so we're looking at environmental corporate governance and social on that side and there is no perfect definition of that but we're really trying to select those investments that play into that so whether it's on the environmental side of\nYou know pollution toxins clean energy climate change\nA green building or if it's on the corporate governance of aboard diversity and we've seen California recently you know and I don't know if you know I agree with everything that's going on but just what I have seen\nAs they're starting to try to require their boards to to have a certain dynamic of men and women on the board you know so government now kind of getting into in regulating that side\nI'm so their portfolios that we look at that we look at labor relations on the social side workplace safety a workplace benefits human rights such huge community development and\nBig I know your big into community Milosevic and how you guys have you're from and your family has been very very active in helping out the community right\nAnd that's absolutely right and a lot of our clients actually attended a our hope connecting hearts Nigeria fundraiser with my dad has been a part of for a long time it's a five oh one C. three that helps a rural villages in Africa\nI'm ... and whether it's helping with their clean water supply or if it's helping with their uh their their building schools are hiring teachers literally having a payroll for teachers this has never been done before these these people used to be really volunteers and they would come in from villages from far away\nAnd to to teach these children incredible people huge hearts right really happy happy people over there but now it's getting there are now being introduced to you know more education on benefits right in right that can do for their own society and to and to keep them moving because they cannot rely on their own governments over there it's corrupt\nOn me so we look at we look at all those different types of things that how can we put together it's one portfolio and have this portfolio still be liquid right and where it's not just all charity we can see some growth in our in our investments to her growth potential and that's really the goal there\nRight and not only that but locally are you guys are very involved locally here in the community and I know that just the last\nYear you had you hoped to local family out a and a covered their mortgage for a while and uh really help them a family that was in need\nRight that's right you know we were able to help a family in the last year I mean and it really gave them a boost and they're actually given back now and I think that's really cool you know and this year we're still looking for that family so we're looking for a family for two thousand Eighteen help us find that family\nHelp us a grant Christmas wish us to a family and need\n'em you can do that you've you called in all week last week about our calculator drive and we're actually making progress on that too and I saw so is that cool or ... you know it was great TI eighty two is in in the hands of as I Can't even believe that the CIA to his around right if you believe they still make\nThose in shock and dismay and you know but let's get that provided let's find that family and need that we can help out so yes we definitely we love doing that in our ... community ... my own parish I'm a Catholic Church of St Vincent de Paul\nIs building a a ... the big capital project where it's like a a big community room center I'm an attached to the church\nWhere one aspect and I think are huge aspect for me was that they're building an area for a large food pantry right there that you know we already feed a lot of homeless people a lot of people that need food but now we're even going to be able to store more food in there\nAnd pressures have stepped up to the plate donated to forget listing built and we're going to be able to help so many other people um ... you know those those are wonderful thing getting involved in in our own community and so people have said and we've seen more and more people come forward and want to help other people we always talk about\nWhat's help help your neighbor right if everybody just was responsible for helping one other person we probably wouldn't have the issues that we have today\nUm you know do unto others as you would want done and to yourself and that's where our socially responsible portfolios come in it's really it's about three legged stool environmental corporate governance and social issues\nThat we kind of put together at a portfolio that can give us investment opportunity and growth in diversification in the market while also helping 'em incredible organizations\nYeah I think that's great ah rewarding uh companies that are rewarding their communities and their employees and\nUh and their clients I think that makes perfect sense and that you guys really are proactive here in the Omaha community and that is so great and that's why I think it's great you have this option now and this is this was a new thing right the socially responsible portfolio\nRight and socially responsible uh funds and and portfolios have been around but\nYou know it it it's it is rather new it's new or a you know and this is a portfolio where it engages so many different aspects and can be so diverse that\nWe can really look through that entire investing universe to select the things that are most important to people and put it together to make sure that it still is a diverse portfolio that can give you a good growth opportunity whether it's on the conservative side about one side or the gross yeah yeah\nAnd it is all about a balanced that'll fit your everybody's own individual personalized needs and personal risk tolerance I'm\nA bill we've talked about risk tolerance a lot on the show
