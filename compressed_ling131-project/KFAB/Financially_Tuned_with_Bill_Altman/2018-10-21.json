ban or like Bruce Banner you is this a\nGood idea should we do this that will test the idea of using a mirror in space to reflect some light to the earth\nIf all goes as planned the banner payload will be deployed next month and unfairly sixty five foot disk of aluminum coded plastic film the experiment will test the feasibility of eliminating points of the earth with light equivalent to that of several moods Russian engineers say it should also teach them a lot about handling thin sheets of plastic in space\n[laughter] the snake space walking cause but not with Saran Wrap [laughter]\nOh no not that you did you get the precedent seal or the actual Saran Wrap have you ever done that guys like your wife asked you to cover something and you get out the precedent seal instead of the Saran Wrap thinking it's the same thing right and then it's not sticking to nothing and then it sticks to everything and uh it can be your life can be rough so now here we are two thousand Eighteen China\nIs planning to launch its own artificial moods see this is a physics dot org so they're a little bit more it's not an intriguing interesting project banner it's\nAn artificial moon by twenty twenty to replace street lamps on and lower electricity costs in urban areas so that that's the reason they're doing it so let me go back to the Nineteen Ninety three article\nNew York times writes if it can be done proponents say\nProviding sunshine at night can save billions of dollars each year and electrical lighting cos extend twilight hours during planting and harvesting seasons to aid farmers allow more working hours on large construction projects and helped rescue and recovery operations after natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes back to China story\nThough the first launch will be experimental the twenty twenty two satellites will be the real deal with great civic and commercial potential the Chinese official said by reflecting the light of the sun the satellites could replace street lamps in urban areas saving an estimated one point two billion you on\nA year electricity costs if the manmade moons eliminating area of fifty square kilometers the extraterrestrial source of light\nSounds like a UFO could also help rescue efforts and disaster zones help during blackouts yet\nUh so I mean this is literally a rehash of what the Russians tempted to do in Nineteen Ninety three didn't work\nUm but we have new materials now new ways of doing things uh the the article here on physics dot org does acknowledge China's not the first country to try beaming summit back to earth in the nineties Russian scientists reporter leaves giant mirrors to reflect light from space in an experiment called banner\nThe artificial moon was announced by ... at an innovation and entrepreneurship conference October tenth and they're going to do it around twenty twenty\nSo there's the thing that China wants to launch an artificial moon to reflect ... back to the earth I'm Around twenty twenty and of course there's all the detractors are like you know is going to mess with people's circadian rhythms are imagine if you wanted to wage war in another country you can just light I'm up all the time so they can never sleep\nYou know that could be but if it boosts their productivity of reduced their cost I don't know if you want to do that so I'm six of one half a dozen of the other\nEight six six for nine six eight seven Seventy welcome to the program Mary how can I help you on computers today\nI'm almost afraid to ask questions about Facebook\nOkay no that's fine you know as long as you don't have a family you won't get banned\n[laughter] All right well I don't like or share anything on Facebook that I don't know where it originated from a friend of mine recently shared host with me that hosted leave from our second bird which\nI ignored and now she's all concerned about um the short version of the very long post when that you had to share it

I'm\nI mean [laughter] so yeah you must for this or you have to pay\nFor Facebook you pay for Facebook Everytime you use it with your personal information so you've already paid for Facebook\nScam so yeah I mean you you did good and not sharing that when it's a total scam I'm basically the Facebook is never going to charge for Facebook because if they charged sweet little old ladies in your gram positive moms and dads and kids everywhere to put their stuff on Facebook no one would put their stuff on Facebook any more\nPeople would just go without in fact there's a huge um I think we've covered this story while back but basically Facebook used to be cool and there was someone in the u._k. they were interviewing the asking why don't use Facebook anymore they said well Facebook used to be cool to my mom started using it\nAnd now she\nKeeps tabs on me so I Can't post anything on Facebook that I don't want my mom to see so I don't use it anymore now use these other things and now there is a revolt even among millennials\nUm and it used to be people would would would criticize millennials for being a I'm In ... on capable of socially interacting with other human beings because their faces buried in their technology so much\nUm what'd you think you know I'd be all for it because you know if your face was buried in tech you're going to pay a lot of money to get that tech fix when it breaks um but that's not the case now millennials are even shutting social media proving that they just don't want to interact with humans at all you know [laughter]\nCome on I'm just joking millennials out that I Know there's some of you listening not many but some of you\nAre so basically it it the social media thing is kind of gotten to the point where nobody really cares what you have for breakfast anymore um nobody nobody you know there there there are those people on Facebook who are truly entertaining people watch things on Facebook that are controversial but motive for importantly what what the social media has taught us about um\nHuman nature is that we tend to interact with people of like mind and when you're on social media and you interact with people who are only like minded\nIt tends to become a reinforce or so that you believe that everyone else out there has your same beliefs which is how these this is how a conservative Facebook page gets three point five million followers and none of them are liberal this is how conservative pages getting band on social media platforms\nBecause everyone wants one liberal\nOf authority focused first and says hey this is bad\nEverybody follows in line behind it and everybody follows a complaint now you have all these millions of complaints that must be bad if millions of people complain about us well millions of people are complaining about conservative things so they keep getting ban conservatives freak out and say there's a conspiracy to ban conservative it's not that it's just that liberals are a lot more organized and they get conservatives banned [noise]\nSo what's the logical thing that's going to happen next\nConservatives are going to start putting out you need to forward this out to twelve friends or Mark Zuckerberg is going to start banning your pages and they'll they'll get non player characters to forward them everywhere I thank you for the call Mary got you into drawing here as well

part of the day go up to thirty five miles per hour that is going to bring in some warmer air we shouldn't be near sixty by lunchtime Ohio around sixty eight degrees across the Omaha metro\nInto that portfolio and we run into all kinds of other risks and so it's a very very important that we talk about this you think about it you talk to your husband or wife about it or or or your your partner or whoever it is to make sure that\nYour position properly for this volatile market and if we did see a huge pull back in the market are you going to be okay will you have to go back to work\nIs your income needs are your income needs going to be satisfied each and every month because I Know in retirements are clients require and count on that income each month\nRight and and that's it is critical and some people are live on fixed incomes and really have to have that and of course we all need to make sure we're going to have the income we need to last us as the rest of our lives and drought our retirement\nAnd to live comfortably in retirement so I I think these are really good points in the elephant in the room is the thing that we usually try to avoid talking about and it's planning for the future planning on our legacy\nAnd planning for one of the biggest life changing events in our lives which is retirement moving from our working years into our retirement years that's a huge one two\nOh most certainly is and you know so it you know if you looked at your portfolio you know when you look at your statements over the last few months and even throughout this year you've certainly seen them the rock and right\nAnd and you know when ... rock and don't come and knock and know that not not not necessarily right we want to make sure that\nYou are in a position that if the markets do pull back you are not going to be hurt nearly as bad as somebody that was fully in the market\nAnd and you know and so sometimes greed takes over a little bit um human it happens to me to its emotional right I mean we can look at I you know everything's second by second we can pull up our phones and look at what's going on in the market you know every single\nTime you turn that phone or open it up you see who my gosh the you know has some peas off you know Fifteen points right now are the ... off a hundred and forty nine points\nYou know we have to make sure that we're not going to be affected in retirement and that your assets are going to be preserved or as as my dad says keeping it all together right we want to make sure that you can keep what you work for so hard all your life we want to keep it together and retirement\nAnd make sure that the income that you'd desire and need in retirement the income that you're going to take from your portfolios is always going to be there\nRegardless of how the market performs\nAnd regardless of how long you live those are very two very important factors and and factors that we don't have a crystal ball with right I mean we don't know what the market's going to do when it's going to do it we have an idea we can look at a technical analysis becoming a fundamental announces however the company's balance sheets and cash flows and all those kind of good things\nBut it's not always the the tell all its ... that's not always gonna be the give us an answer up when something's gonna happen and we know the markets a little overheated we're in an extended Bull Run but again like I said earlier and I said on other shows\nThis could keep going for quite a while or it's something that we can really see some serious struggles with we could seriously see volatility I mean look at\nLook at a last week not not this past week but the week before I mean we saw it in two day period fourteen hundred points down on the Dow Jones you know we've seen swings during the day of\nFour hundred points up ... points down I mean it's been a while the volatile market\nYeah we're starting to see more and more of that ... been you know we had those record highs everything was looking great now we're starting to see volatility creeping inflation a creep up a bit the fed raising the interest rate so all of his plays a big factor a big part of it doesn't\nIt really really does and in you know part of your portfolio I'm gonna\nUh definitely want to talk about ways that we can I'm Still participate in the market without the downside risk and we do believe that these products should be in a most people's portfolio okay again it's there's not a one size fits all out there in every portfolios different every need\nA in wanting desire in retirement it's gonna be different but we need to make sure that if you're\nIf you're that ordinary person who's worked all their life right and and you know it's time that you need to start pulling back and pay attention to what's going on and make sure you're not taken unnecessary risks this is going to be for you\nYeah and let's get into that a little more and our next segment but we should take a quick break right here bill is there anything you want to add for our listeners before the break\nAbsolutely you know a ... many of you are opening statements and you're seeing 'em markets again be volatile and you're worried\nAnd allow us to do a complementary custom review with you and make sure that your portfolio is doing what it needs to do we can give you that second opinion give us a call for zero to five five seven six seven three zero\nAgain for zero to five five seven sixty seven thirty we will fully examined your portfolio you're holding your income needs and make sure that you're in the best possible scenario for you\nAll right sounds great and listeners stay tuned we're going to be right back with more of bill Altman here on financially tune right after this\nAnd do you ever feel like you can't help navigating retirement retirement can be getting what if something happens with our retirement income you could get you in the house here you are retired\nBy ... ...\nHaitians planning legacy planning and more we see your retirement and the premier so right now\nBy going by just\nFive five seven six seven legion\nAnd welcome back to financially to name your co host Tony short and our host is the man with the plan bill Altman of premier advisory group and bill great shows so far today we're talking about the elephant in the room\nAnd you finished up talking about how there are certain things people might need in their portfolios so they don't have to worry about the ups and downs of the market\nTo hopefully continue them through a ... can you talk about that in a little more detail or where do you want to go with that from here\nGets great Tony absolutely you know so again you know your ... let's just say you're sixty five years old you're thinking about retiring near a year away here from retirement then and you really want to make sure that things are button\nYou know first we have to look at your your income needs right your expenses and and really what you're wanting and desire and in retirement what you're going to do and\nWe have to make sure that you have that income and we're going to maintain that income for the rest of your life we talk so often on the phone or on the other radio here about ... about what's going on in the markets and our best dividends and all those kind of good things right which are fantastic don't get me wrong but you need that balance\nThe other side of that balance can either be some short term bonds right now no longer an intermediate term we want to be careful with because of interest rate still going up we could see another for interest rate increases by this time next year so we really want to be careful\nAbout any intermediate or longer term bonds but the short term once just don't really pay much interest and they still have that market risk that all there is to it\nSo as an alternative we look towards our fixed indexed annuities not the variable products but the fixed indexed\nThe products that your principal isn't guaranteed a if you you know you have a hundred thousand dollars in years there's no risk to your principal however that principal can increase with market returns if the S. and P. five hundred for instance goes up\nThen your accounts will indeed increase in value right and every year your accounts will lock in whatever gains that year that that that product made right so if you had\nA hundred thousand dollar account and the indexes your strategies produced five percent you're going to lock in next year at a hundred and five thousand now Tony that means if the market decides to go backwards that next year okay so you're locked in it a hundred and five thousand\nIf the market goes down you're still going to be locked in at a hundred and five thousand\nYou reset each year usually most products and most strategies we'll reset on a year by year basis so you go from point a to point B\nFor example two thousand Eighteen I buy in right now to two thousand Nineteen whatever that strategy does I lock in that interest\nAnd I reset at my ... at point a again than point a to point B Nineteen to two thousand twenty again lock in those gains however if it was a market if the market when backwards\nNo losses and that is what we call zero zero zero right\nBecause the last thing your portfolio especially the safe money the safe money within your portfolio the last thing that you want to see you do is go backwards\nI Want to make sure that when it goes backwards it's because you are taking the withdrawal and that's very important for the safe money portion of your portfolio\nRight and you have\nTo have some money where your principal is protected and it is safer\nUh and not are at risk obviously there's some diversity you can have within a stock portfolio but that's not what you're talking about you're talking about having anything in the stock market is is going to be at risk somewhat ... and you need that growth but you also need some a veteran options where your principles protected don't ya", "show_name": "Financially Tuned with Bill Altman", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "21"}
