little breezy to start off today temperatures in the mid forties now we'll see plenty of sunshine and those wins will be letting up as we head into the afternoon temperatures climbing to about fifty five to fifty seven degrees by lunchtime topping out in the low to mid sixties across most of the area this afternoon was Omaha most accurate\nIs that on top of the one thirty four that's right okay that's what I pay your one thirty four call it an extra hundred bucks for the Medicare supplement and then you have to also by apart the right that's correct okay and that's your prescription drug plan\nYeah and and and those plants run about ... just on a premium size about twenty to fifty bucks a month\nOkay so we're at a hundred and thirty four plus we'll call it a hundred ... two thirty four plus another\nIt's all on the very low side twenty bucks right right okay so we're at two hundred and fifty four dollars a month if you're on the supplement plans can your premiums go up each year\nUh yes yeah I mean in Nebraska isn't attained age state okay and so Nebraska has the right to do or excuse me the insurance companies have the right to to raise the premium\n... and that's and and and typically they will because as as folks get older as you know the claims go higher and so um there's more so they have to cover their their costs\nRight so as you get older the plans to get more expensive right um so that's important to remember does your part D drug plan also get more expensive\n[noise] typically that'll stay pretty flat but\nAs a as you know as you get older your co payments for the the drug plan you'll probably you know folks typically will use more prescriptions as they get older sure and and so that's where you'll probably see more increase and costs\nLike it so that's one route right we go to supplement route and when the first time you are getting in to Medicare supplements ah it's all a guaranteed issue um for the first the first time right and if you're on a supplement from year to year you can switch from supplement to supplement is that correct\n[noise] uh well it's it's challenging some time see how do you have to show health insurer ability if you switch from supplement some\nNo kidding okay so if I'm On a Blue Cross supplement for instance and I'm now in an open enrollment and I want to get a uh uh I'm just gonna say United healthcare supplement plan United healthcare is going to demand ensure ability\nYeah they will gotcha now now you could easily change your prescription drug plan you know you could definitely changed that from year to year\nWithout ensure ability that's right okay\nSo you know that's very important to remember so were you know we have to look at this and and look at the long term pitcher but right now bill said that you know if I'm spending in about two hundred and fifty dollars a month at sixty five years old\nOn you know your part B your supplement a hundred dollar supplement and then you're twenty dollar a drug plan again that's the lowest drug plan and those are all the beginning rates just at sixty five and they will go up that three thousand dollars a year right there\nUm so that's one side of the coin and those plans are good uh but as we talked about earlier in the show\nMedicare really has that figure it out so that's not the only option there are other options were going to talk about that in a little bit uh we are going to go to break\nBefore we go to a break though I Do want to let you know or that you can call us any time if you want to talk about Medicare if you want to sit down with Bill Kaiser if you want to talk about Social Security or your investments we are here for you and we're offering a\nComplimentary when our consultation right here at our office or we

me bill Altman from the premier advisory group and today a special guest Mr bill Kaiser right there and the author specializing in Medicare bill in the last segment of the show we talked about Medicare supplements and\nThere's another route to go down if a if you're looking at Medicare or if you're in that markets or what's the second route\nYeah the second round is called a Medicare Advantage plans are plants sees\nAnd so these have been around for about Twenty years they've really again come into their own in the last five to ten years there's some really strong plants that are out there I use the analogy on these plans to you know the as as members have gone into these plants they're the they're kinda like a snowball going down a hill you know these plants have\nGathered strength as as they've gained members and um it increase the uh I guess the\nUh the volume in these plans you know they've they've they've provided more benefits or to their to their members as they've gotten stronger and so it's ... as a as an option for health care when you're on Medicare\nIt they're definitely something you have to look at\nRight so a Medicare Advantage again is growing in popularity or one aspect of the Medicare Advantage plan that I have really a grown to light can appreciate over the last decade I have seen it\nWhen I worked for clients are for over ten years and this is a plan that United healthcare\nHas created called Medicare completes and this was one of those part C or plan sees that you're talking about right that's right okay so we have Medicare complete by United healthcare a it's a Medicare Advantage it are there I Would say the plan that\nThat has worked so well for so many years for so many of our clients as a zero premium so that is\nAgain folks zero extra premium so that's zero premium for that second stage right of your Medicare and zero premium for that part D that drug plan\nYou have your one hundred and thirty four dollars and Ninety cents at you pay and then plus you're going to pay a um nothing zero zero dollar premium for that the extras right and we're going to talk about those extras 'cause I Do think they're really really important\nA bill like let's talk about that plan what ... what are the feature ... what what are the benefits and then after that what has changed over the last year that's going to be new and two thousand light team\nYeah yeah and what one note about that plant bill is that um you know that plan and you often hear referred to uh on on TV\nThey're on the media it's the A. R. P. Medicare complete plans and so you don't have to be a member of a A R P but it's it's a\nA a rpm and United healthcare work well together they've had a long distance relationship they've they've they've ah\nThey've increased that they've linked in that relationship as well some of the benefits and features of that plan let's talk about that so these plants have three components of it they have a health care component they have a prescription drug component and they also have an extra benefits component and so particularly on the on the health care side\nUh some things that they've made some improvements on\n... there it's kind of a pay as you go so as you need to use health care you get paid for it so for example to go see your main your primary care doctor cautious five dollars\nDoesn't I think this year I twenty Eighteen that cost you ten dollars and so that's one change nice change they mate as well\nSo ... ten dollars to see my\nPrimary care provider yeah but that but for twenty Nineteen it's gone down to five dollars five dollars to see your primary care provider serve as a co pay you bet okay but uh\nTo go see a specialist a it costs forty five dollars now\nThe there's a network that's involved with these plants and so\nThis particular plan is got a great network in this area you got all the main health systems that are part of that you got ... chai the brass can medicine and Methodist that are part of that so most of the doctors in the area are are in there I always make sure when I sit down with someone that we we check your\nWith your own to check your own doctor we'll see if that doctors in the network and so we always want to see that name in print you know as well\nSo you know that's that's the cost for the the the doctor's office visits one thing about these plants they really focus on prevention wellness keeping out of the hospital keeping you out of the emergency room so your preventive services there's no co payment for that\nAnd it was a long list of preventive services that are covered\nBut but but some of them more notable things that are more commonly known as I mean your your annual physical is is covered a in mammograms colonoscopies flu shots things like that those are all covered no cost for those\nWhile that's amazing a there is a benefit that I found really really cool um this coming year and two thousand Nineteen we talked earlier a little bit about dental uh what's what's going on with dental so this plant actually includes dental services\nYeah it's it's ah it's pretty neat like ... ... regular Medicare does not cover a dental services so this in these Medicare Advantage plans on the United planet particular\nUh it does cover dental so like all your preventive services you're you're cleaning your exams or X rays fluoride you see there's no cost for that as long as used one of the dentist that are within the network and it's a pretty good size network here in this area uh you know there is no costs with at one time every six months or twice a year\nBut one thing that they've added for this next year in twenty Nineteen is that they've they're providing every member a thousand dollars that they could allocate towards comprehensive services and so these are things like you know what would be in a comprehensive service obviously things like crowns bridges you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Financially Tuned with Bill Altman", "city": "Omaha", "day": "28"}
