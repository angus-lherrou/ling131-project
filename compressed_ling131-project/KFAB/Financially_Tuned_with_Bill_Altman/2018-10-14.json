those tools is a fake update\nSo basically there is a fake update going around right now that is installing ransom or not ransomware crypto mining software on your computer pops up and says the doping\nUpdate and when you install it in your browser installs an extension that minds for crypto currency using your power and your computers processor in the background while you're computers turned on now anybody who knows anything about crypto currency knows that you're not going to mine anything\nOn uh computers Web browser it it's not even worth your time writing the code unless of course you can push this out to a few million computers mining simultaneously as a group as a as a pool basically\nThen they combine they're processing power together and they can make something really big happen\nThey can make hundreds of thousands of dollars for the attacker and all he has to do is get your computer infected it only uses a little Italy uses a little bit more power like a lot more power so you could run on your computer for a month before you get your electric bill and you're like what is going on to my electric bill is so high\nAnd then you might not make the immediate conclusion that it's your computer so because your computers performance hasn't really degraded because it's been running slow anyway because you know all the patches for the last six months\nSo yeah this is the newest thing that's coming out this is exactly why secure update or exist so that you don't get this kind of garbage infecting your computer because\nEven if you have great anti virus software like semantic endpoint\nThese are the vulnerabilities that can circumvent any anti virus so you want to make sure you've got good anti virus and you've got sick you're up to running on your computer to do these third party updates now right along here with the security\nNot mysterious gray hat is patching people's outdated micro tech routers\nUm ... you may not know what the microchip router is not something that we used too much in America so uh you don't have to worry too much about it but it is one of those riders that's pushed out by an Internet service provider so how many of you know the brand\nThe internal brand of the wireless router that's built into your new a spectrum cable modem\nYou know that's what I tell customers I don't like using those integrated ones that are built into the router I prefer to disable those ads is built into the modem disabled those ones that are built into the modem and get a separate router that you can control and upgrading update because it makes your security so much better\nAnd this is what a Russian speaking gray hat hacker is breaking into people's my critic routers and patching devices so they can't be abused by crypto jak hers button that herders they'd heard a or other cyber criminals the hacker who goes by the name Alexei\nHe says he works as a server administrator and he claims to a disinfected over a hundred thousand routers already Alexei is not trying to hide his actions and his boost as boasted of his hobby on Russian logging platforms and he says access to routers and he access as writers and mixed or changes to their settings to prevent further abuse\nI added firewall rules that that block access to the writer from outside of the local network\nAnd the comments I wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the router on a telegram channel where it was possible for them to ask questions but despite adjusting firewall settings for a hundred thousand users Alexa says that only fifty users reached out to him about the change he made to their routers a as a few said thanks but most were outraged\nThe vigilante server administrators says he's only out there fixing routers that have not been patched by their owners against\nThe vulnerability that we came to light last April so\nWhat are you saying is there's a firm where update for your routers guys and you're not installing them so I Am using that vulnerability to get into your router and I'm installing the my critic patch\nThat closes the vulnerability and an even leaving you a note saying hey I hacked into your stuff but I patched it and now you're secure and if you have questions here's how you can reach me\nAnd he actually responds to people I mean I mean we've joked in shock for this is like an ongoing joke in the show he got one of those Microsoft scam calls Oh yes we've detected your IP address husband infection now we need to look at this this is Microsoft

Microsoft provider service provider and you know\nIt there's and this is the this is the shady part you have to have a lead to get into the computer right so and I don't want to lie to people so is there there is a good possibility your computer could have some vulnerabilities that need to be a plug and we're going to do that for you for free over the shock desk or we just the remote access to your computer and\nAs history shows us four and five people will allow you the access to the computer so we're how how much money could we make as a company\nIf we call people up at random and got them to let us into the computer but then we only fixed real problems because that's the thing the camera's always find problems even if there are no problems they always find all these atrocious problems and then they want four hundred dollars to fix it but what is\nThe newest one now is a there's a scammer that calls and sells you a legit copy of conspiracy\nThat you actually are buying real software they still put the remote access Trojan on your computer so they can the rats so they can get back in later but they they put real anti virus on the computer and they really charge you for ... and you get a code and everything\nThat's the latest scam um but yeah we we joked about this before we could be millionaires and all we'd have to do is to honest work of fixing real problems for people so yeah it's kind of shady but you know why we'd be doing good work and that's kind of this guy is doing you know he's he's hacking and he's breaking into your house\nBecause the locks on your

will melt with all the hospitals accurate whether team I'm\nYou know is is it is this the end of the market has everything if you think about it how often do we see that a single time we have a down day a big day Italians let's see I ... in the end of the sky is falling oh come on\nYou know sky is not following anywhere you know and the younger you are the more risky you can be and the older you are the more safety I have to be that you know and if we follow some simple common\nAnd the rules a Brian ... talked about common sense Brian ... chief investment strategist for being with capital markets\nA massive financial institution how to Canada a global they worked all over the place Brian ... is an amazing a presenter reason an amazing amazing investment strategist right but you know hearing him talk and all of his years of experience in the market\nHe says hey you know this isn't a sky is falling situation list as they\nSure that your properly balanced situation and that is true for every body myself included Tony included [noise]\nEverybody in all walks of life you want to be balanced appropriately for your time your time horizon your level of risk your sleep factor that number that we talk about where you can get your score\nThat's important to me and it should be important to all of you\nWell yeah and I I like how you put that because it's important to understand and this is what you always emphasizes that everybody's situation is different that's\nWhy we need to work with a trusted financial professional like yourself to sit down and figure out okay you know you have this much money saved you're in this situation you want to retire at this time\nA year risk tolerance is higher than most or your risk tolerance is lower than most and here's your age all these different factors\nCome into play and a lot of people just you're too close to your own situation you know a brain surgeon isn't going to operate on himself and right that's why you need a financial professionals somebody and say hey you've got Fifteen hundred\nPuzzle pieces laid out on the table but you don't you don't know what the final pictures going to look like you know one of the ... that's why you need a financial planner and professional a bill you are that ...\nOh well thank you very much I appreciate that I'll take that as a compliment\nOr you're the big picture guy\nI Love it yeah you know and I love the analogy of the puzzle so you know we thought thinking about that way and the pitcher in my head Estonia was talking was all you know all these pieces laid out and but nothing put together going to start organizing their right\nWe've got to put the corners aside and a little pilots at least I don't know oh yeah everybody else does and I live in the middle and a pile right in the end of the science he put it in a pile and then you start building this pitcher slowly and a lotta times referring back to that box led right that rank pitcher\nUm you know and and then at that point you are defining direction right you are now defining in creating a road map of where you're going to go where your portfolio is going to go\nWhere your puzzle is going to go right and we can kind of have an idea of of how long this is going to take what's gonna happen at the end of the day will there be tougher times when we're finding the pieces that you know how many of you know working puzzles\nCould not find that one piece and you know or it's like come on and it's right in front of you know the whole time that is what we see in portfolios Tony ... it's almost like sometimes I see a grab bag it's what I call it they'll have a statement in here and and I'm not going to pick on any brokerage is there anything 'cause see it all the time different for different companies\nAnd we looked through the statement of it's like really smokes and I put everything in Morningstar resorted to our analysis on it sure you know in all of a sudden we're we're saying wait a second this portfolio lacks any clear discernible style right there's no style there is no direction in it\nWhere does this go and it was just a grab bag that we're like OK let's pick outlets mutual fund in this mutual fund and pop those and you should be good whoa you know\nCandy bar the door what's gonna happen ... or right this is what's gonna happen at this point where's the portfolio going\nYou know what kind of overlap as there overlap is where you know you'll have let's say five different mutual funds and in all five of those mutual funds hold a lot of the same stocks the heck are we doing with that why is that they're you know overlap it's diluting performance it's increasing the risk\nYou know and there's no need for it so when we go into portfolios like our grading fifty\nAnd then which is again on blue chip value us where they're all all fifty stocks pay a death and then all of them are us all of them are large cap when we have that we can start with fifty individual stocks and there there is no overlap\nRight and and so at that point we can actively manage a portfolio to make sure that we're we're we're growing we're creating income and we're staying defensive and volatile markets\nYeah and so obviously you have to look at all these things and everybody situation is different but the most important piece of that puzzle you talked about the corner and the sides we all kind of do it that way but the most important piece as the ... ... you're not going to put together a Fifteen hundred beats puzzle\nOr five thousand piece puzzle if you don't have the box I mean\nIt it is true that it isn't going to happen so right you have to have that and a lot of people can't see that on their own it's like you know a brain surgeon and operate on his own brain you've got to have\nA somebody with the big picture who can help you know put it all together and see oh that's where I Need to go so I could then they can make the right decisions on what pieces to put where\nAnd and with the markets and the inflation creeping up the fed saying they're going to keep raising rates and you know we'll see where we're headed with terrorists and the midterms and then right after that you're going to have Christmas and uh is retail doing well you know I I think all these factors\nCome into play and you could worry about this stuff a lot or you don't have to worry about it at all if you have a plan in place right that's what you're trying to say\nExactly right and there's nothing wrong with a little worry it shows me that you're truly interested in in your own portfolio in your own future of the destiny right\nAnd that's really good I talked to people all day with salt and we'll take on new clients and on the on boarding process one of the you know we're talking about how often we're going to meet and that's always a question that pops up how how often you know will you meet with us and my answer is always that sometimes depends on you I asked for at least the bare minimum of once a year\nYou know and that kind of sounds bizarre when I say that\nAnd they always going to look at me and I say and the reason for that is because\nSome people it's almost like they just forget about it they're so easy going and it's just they let us manage it and do all that I Want you to stay involved with it I don't that's OK right and and if that's you that's okay we'll manage it will do everything\nBefore you will constantly acting your best interests were fed do Sherrie that's our obligation but I Want people to be involved I Want our clients to be involved in their own in their own destiny with their finances right and and and like they haven't been forever I had this is very interesting I had a client come over\nAnd ah there's all of a ... a rather large accounts a new client fairly recent\nThis broker says I Am the reason for your IRA I Am the one who told you to start that it was a romp IRA that wrong firing I Am the reason for it and I looked at\nOur new client list and no you you are the reason for Europe irate you are the only reason for Europe IRA it's our job to make sure that you're in proper products intact strategies\nAnd and different things like that that's what we do every day that's our job already right but because you have an an IRA or a four O. one K. or I'm wrong or whatever it is\nYour reason for that and congratulations to you you worked all your life building this up now let's take control and make sure it's working in the best possible way for you\nYeah yeah I think that you made a great point there are obviously you're there to provide guidance and help them make the best decisions they can you're not making decisions for them\nA year pointing out your your your options are and recommending certain things but\nI I just think it's so important to have a solid written plan in place especially with the market volatility and we don't know when uh the market's going to drop we should be concerned but it's not something you should lay awake at night you just need to make sure your assets\nAre properly allocate it and you don't have all your eggs in one basket I Know that sounds cliche but it is so important when it comes to your investments isn't it\nIt it really really is it's just the key to have that road map to have a person that you can trust somebody that's on your side\nSomebody that's looking out for you and someone that's educating new yeah you know and we take pride in that we want to make sure our clients understand\nWhat's going on and why are we doing this and I don't expect than ever to pretend how to build them watch right we want to be able to tell time and I want them to feel confident with that and feel confident knowing that when they go to bed at night\nThat their their money is being well managed their properly balanced and a wake up to a new day and retirement will be wonderful and that's our goal\nYeah and that's a great goal now let's take a quick break and then come back and we'll wrap up the show but ah before the break it you have anything you want to offer our listeners bill\nAbsolutely with all the volatility and
