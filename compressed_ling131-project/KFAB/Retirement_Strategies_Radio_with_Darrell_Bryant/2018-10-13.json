{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "Run very recorded an album cat the Fillmore auditorium in that group once these men I Know and the even handler Baluchistan\nWhich later became Miliband\nPretty neat that they were the backup for Chuck Berry on an album\nVery neat you know or see Miller has been around for a long long time if you want to look into some Steve Miller you can pull up when he was just a kid playing I mean a kid kid and his his uh entrance\nInto playing with a rock and roll band and his relationship as a youngster with a ball Skaggs and are there went to the same school I Love Steve Miller Steve Miller Jerry Radford the bus gags you know these guys are kind of throw them at all similar genres of rock and roll speak\nOr you lost me is that my friend and numbers which is a weird cooperation but you are very focused on those two things\nI Love how music music is just a set of numbers are absolutely\nRight in the form of ... I Do need to remember that absolutely one or two three four over and over something she loves sports whether it's you know back in the day coach and your kids are watching him play and sure just watching it on TV you love sports and and and we share that in common as well and\nAnd Sports Illustrated study finding that eighty percent of NFL players go broke within two years of working hiring\nJordan Waxman wealth manager for dozens of current players talked about that on Fox Business\nThe toughest thing for an aggressive young athlete is to think defensively if they think well I'm going to make more money that I've ever made in my life how do I make that last short career long retirement\nNow of course he's talking about professional athletes who are earning millions of dollars and you know down here in friends over the years listen professional athletes that are never tired and things like that but yeah there's also a lesson here for those of us who have normal careers\nWell of course there is you know there is a cycle just like there's market cycles and economic cycles and all that kind of thing is also kind of\nJust some cycles that come along or opportunities that come along in life and sometimes they're short lived\nI think the easiest wanted to point out is what you're doing right there is a professional athlete I can think of a professional athletes that I Know right here in town and um he you know using a league for a good number of years made some money but he was smart with it and now you don't see I'm working and I know in other professional athlete here in town that\nI did a similar thing a highly highly successful did not necessarily save tons of money and is back to work and so that's just the way that goes and so as a just a rank and file you know person or you do have to think strategically you have to think\nDefensively a lot of people do when they moved toward retirement is they they stay on the fence and as it relates to our\nOffice since we're retirement management folk\nUh we're interested in is making sure that we're not going to run out of money that takes us really all kinds of ties together doesn't Chris in the last segment we talked about\nYou know that the market cycles and and ah you know we're always talking about run out of gas and so forth you know when we get ready to\nRetire and as a as my money going to last there is a quote that was just ... to me or as we speak by a fellow that I Know he's an advisor in another state that I get to see occasionally and it's a quote by Benjamin Graham who's the dean of Wall Street and his statement was the essence of investment management is not is the management of risk\nNot the management of returns we tend to forget that when we get ready to retire we tend to forget that\nWhen things are going well here's the deal when things are going well if you're a professional athlete making millions it's or a rock star selling albums a couple of easy ones there it's easy for these people to think that this was going to go on forever or all smart and not in my last couple of years and save some bucks back cetera\nRather than living within your means\nBuying properties not wearing it on your sleeve as many of these professional athletes do okay or rock stars do they they wear their wealth or the ... they wear their success publicly okay\nVery hard to show it off and mhm Second Life often when people are showing it off so much there's really nothing there\nIndeed that that is exactly the case and we've talked also on this show about folks here in Omaha do not wear it on their sleeve and wouldn't you know that here or we are in a conservative city and state of Nebraska Omaha Nebraska and\nThe folks that come into the office as we mentioned before are not wearing their wealth on their sleeves you'd never know when they came pulling up and they're in their Toyota or you know old Ford pick up that they have a mass the wealth that they have\nAnd that's extremely refreshing to me they've done the right thing they've done as my dad said they stayed within their means they lived within their means and put saving as a priority\nAnd they weren't ever thinking that they're a guaranteed anything in the future so you'd better stored up now and so that's just a really really good thing to keep in mind then as are approaching retirement the wise retiree whats say listen\nI haven't made don't I in other words if I Do the math\nI Want a certain lifestyle that lifestyle is going to cost me a hundred grand or whatever the number is four year\nOkay so going toward that I had my Social Security is or pensions et cetera and so my shortages acts my shortages is forty thousand dollars a year okay but I at one point three one point for laying around whatever the number might be okay there's I don't care four hundred thousand one point four million or whatever\nThe numbers are probably going to be relative to your lifestyle and the question when\nYou get ready to retire especially when we are nearing the top of the market I mean yes the market was you know a couple of thousand points higher et cetera nonetheless when you're approaching retirement\nIf we were to do the math and determine you know what you know Joe and Betty if you just turned two percent for the rest of your life for the next thirty five years I Can't get you to run out of money you're just not going to run out of money even give you a pay raise every year for inflation et cetera\nIf that is the kind of math were arriving at are the kind of conclusion that our masses leading us too then you have to begin to have a conversation of do I want to risk anything anyways I Am one of the one percenters I'm One of the half of one\nPercenters and the whole country that can do with everybody wants to do which has never worried about money again so is that the\nKids to be afraid and feeling when that occurs\nOf course but the problem is is people don't think and they they continue to grow grow grow your dollars why because that's what we train them to do in my industry because you're coming out of a growth phase of\nLife and you're moving into out of the accumulation phase and into what we call the ... face\nRight but the fear is that you're going to run out of money okay but nobody really stops in thinks meaning advisors meaning the general public meeting the person who has seven eight hundred thousand dollars for a million dollars laying around\nAnd then they leave everything at risk\nBecause they're complacent because of several years of growth such as what we've had recently then the market finally decides to correct as many economists are pointing to two thousand uh Nineteen or two thousand an Eighteen even that we would see\nA steep recession even depression style recession is what some people are saying and you just ignore that the same as you ignored in two thousand and seven it was a lesson that kind of dialogue\nProceeded the decline in two thousand seven eight nine it was on the cover of magazines it was on the cover of time magazine that said are we going to have a recession\nOr a depression how bad is it going to be these are the kind of headlines that we're seeing now does that mean that I Know for a fact is going to happen next week of course not but the point of the matter is that does happen eventually for you to go into retirement thinking that it's just not going to happen\nTo you this is not going to happen in your lifetime is not going to happen in your retirement is foolhardy so you have to\nTake into account where I Am I in a relationship to running out of money let's not talk about the risk tolerance I'm not I'm not necessarily interested as much\nIn my family's tolerance for risk in other words what makes you lose sleep at night that's relevant yes of course\nHowever when I'm Wondering is not the risk tolerance but the but the return requirement okay because of the return requirement is low then we can therefore lower the risk in the investment portfolio and as I just stated\nA managing money is not about managing returns it's about managing risk and that becomes very very pronounced for the retiree\nSo these are the kind of conversations that we have a conference table all week long do I really need the risk how much risk is in my portfolio oh my gosh I had no idea that I could have an implosion of you know thirty eight percent if we were to have a repeat of two thousand and eight et cetera this is information you ... do\nWe know that the greatest fear is running out of money for people absolutely not a lot of retirees are sometimes taking drastic measures to prevent that living a lot more frugal of a life than they used to combat that but the planning well you you makes it so that that's not just the only way to handle it\nOh of course now we don't want to back down your income for goodness sake one of the main things I have to do here in this office is convince one of the two of the couple that it is time to start spending some money why on earth did you make all of these sacrifices if you're not going to enjoy the fruit of your labor mhm you're just going to continue to sacrifice the rest of your life\nI mean I have clients will come in and their way they're way over say they're they're very they're very well\nEstablished financially and yet that is the thing that one of the two in the other couple are typically the guy at that point\nIs saying I got to hang onto this because it's by security blanket well this fellow just needs to learn how to set up an income point and nationally he'll enjoying income that is fifty three percent higher than what he had in mind that is a national

one of the easiest ways to collect wages are raped him into a large trash can plastic trash can that's lined with a large plastic bag right this is why when the baguettes fully pull it out and you put another bag and just keep raking\nUm but the problem is if you've ever\n... especially if the leaves a wet but if you pack the bags with leaves it's almost impossible to pull them out of the can because there's a suction up for it yeah it rise I'd had this problem recently\nSo I thought well here's the IRS way how to solve that the reason that there is a success because of that can be informed so if you introduce all air of course you break that vacuum so that's why I did an old plastic trash can so I just drove ... drill holes in the bottom and around the side I think there were five eighth inch diameter holes with a ... a bunch of holes\nAnd now when you go to pull off that plastic bag slide dried out cars soon as you break that vacuum a little bit doesn't take much air can

yeah right if you didn't like most of us\nThen yeah call and don't wait till December because they'll say fine will be out in April and then be helping 'em and getting back to what you said about the importance of having a Gemini cleaned up if you're burning wood that's not hardwood and not really really dry ha ha\nYou should really never burn software but sometimes have been and what you've got available you have to burn it but\nYou know software it and what what has high in Korea so well to suffer with hiring Korea so and which is like a black\nI'm like I'm not ... not really a tar but it's like a blacks up to the sticks the inside a fireplace and that is flammable so that's why you have it's not you're not just cleaning out smokes danger clean up that Korea so so that that's the most important thing and that's the reason you have to do it now is a good time\nAnd there's a lot of real simple things you can do around the house we talk about you know I'm stealing up the ... the home or what the heck does that mean well it's just simple things that you just walk around your house look at windows and doors look around um ... look around where the drier\nEvent is any of those little places that have little cracks means that the cold air is going to sneak into your house\nAnd Rob you of your energy dollars [laughter] yeah I like that so if you need to be careful that but it's so simple you just get I'm Talking you seal around these areas and it's a sizable gap um use some of the expandable phone now um I'll tell you what I've really enjoyed I'm\nFinding out about the last few years is the latex version of that because one of the first versions of that expandable\nPhone first of all it'll blow your wall out if you're not careful because it expands so much but also if you got it on your fingers you would have to like the sand you stay on paper to get it off I mean it was\nTerrible but now the latex version is just as good in terms of sealing up these gaps but is it much easier to clean up but just that's the kind of thing just look at any gap that you have and also another little tip is there's there's other call out there\nOther than just white so some of the colored type call that you can use the tan or brown or whatever might allow you to do the call came without doing any such a pain\nAnd that's always a good thing and Joe I'll tell you another one that I see all the time is that air conditioning evaporative lines those copper lines that come out of the wall and there's gaps in their big enough for a nice big mouse decline right into the house\nYeah I mean I I think we had mentioned this recently walked around the outside of your house and take your time and really look and if you see this gap that you you think is too small\nIt isn't ... you'd be surprised how small space a little critter can crawl and not to mention of course bugs and things like that they can crawl into almost any space but mice will squeeze into the tunas tiniest space\nThere's almost no space that's that's too small for animal to get in so now the time to do that you want to wait until it's too cold and snowy or whatever and getting back to your a quick comment on the uh the\nInflating phoned the spray foam uh-huh the expanding from I recently put in a new window in our kitchen and the old window was just inflated with a fiberglass was stuffed in there's I pulled that out when they put in a new window\nAnd I used to spray phone the the expanding from but there is a specific type called window and door and slate a window and door\nUm phone that's what you want because it doesn't expand very much because then he said it just the regular one expand so much of a bow in your window or your door frame and had a door or window won't close so I'm be really careful with that to spray and\nFill the gap halfway not all the way cars that can expand twice as much so so ... window and door ceiling around windows and\nAnd boy that makes you feel really good when you have that window in place or a door in place and you have to trim off of the inside and you see these gap sometimes it can be three quarters of an age gap the height of the door and to be able to put that phone man steal that out completely just one more way that you're driving\nAnd down your energy caused at keeping your home comfortable so and that's what we're all about

sometimes uh you often think uh I was on a I'm a battleship recently and they have those um\nDoors were you close the door then you why you know for that again or do they actually have battleships you can walk around and look at you had to tell them and they and they have those ... where you know the waves heating in is not going to get through some situations Lloyd it seems like you need that kind of door but\nI'm so let me ask you this um so there's um a soon there's a little bit of an overhang\nJust above that on on your roof the roof comes down\nRight okay Rufus about [noise] six to eight feet high\nThat say okay that's that's a you know the ... there there are several ways of going about this first of all you try to keep as much water away from there as you can and you know of course you'd be the best thing is just to build the stoop or a little porch Jerry Buss a lot of work\nI'm One of the things that we found that a lot of people um found very advantageous to use a piece of rain divert or metal\nAnd you take a piece about four to five feet long which is kind of an L shaped piece of galvanized metal that you slipped right under the edge of your shingles about six inches up from the edge\nAnd just kick the water it just that water coming down from the roof you're kicking it away so that you minimize the amount of water that gets on the door\nUm then certainly I'm a call ... around every aspect of the door especially around the top is important and then making sure that weather seal the the actual weather stripping is in good shape and when your closing that door

door and providing a little more insulation value to the door but it also blocks that water from getting to the main part of the door that might leak so I think those few little checklist on and you'll find that you can take care of it and if you install a new door just make sure that you're single ended up talking it extremely well\nAs you go along and uh I think that's really the way to attack it just got to go after anything that could possibly leak\nAnd the reindeer herder metal all of these things will will help you have a ... house there\nOkay thanks [noise]\nHey we're glad to
