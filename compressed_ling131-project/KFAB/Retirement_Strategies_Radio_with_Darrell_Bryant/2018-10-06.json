um their\nCommon areas on on those were the oil started leaking I'm by no you know it's hard to define words coming I'm\nAs oil eggs are essentially is got to START I didn't\nKnow that was it was called a common problem with those are common area where they started leaking well um\nYeah there is um ... have you looked at it at all to\nTo see what areas specifically you're\nWell yeah I look but once again it's hard to tell because the the oil you know you go back a blow was back from\nSure you're right that I write about um you know oil scooter lines or one a transmission\n... another league um well pressure switches they add more Tennessee just to go bad not read correctly than they do actually league but typically over\nCar repair oil pressure switches can certainly league\nYou're probably biggest leak on that pick your vehicle and that took your engine style is the or is it remains seal and remains steel plate\nAnd that is a you know back in ... before they redesigned this particular engine you just had to remain steel and the whole back of the block was closed off was just ... and that's all it was now you have a big huge plate back there that is sealed by a gasket and it has the remains he'll incorporated it was actually\nA better upgraded design but the gasket just didn't last for a long ... guess last a hundred thousand miles a lot of times um and that is probably your biggest like that's probably the biggest common like\nFor what a that's a that's a major thing to replace that\nUh you know eleven twelve hundred bucks most of it it's going to be labor could you got a slip back to you know pull transmission yes a transfer case transmissions gotta gotta slip back in order to be able to get your hands up and there are enough to be able to change that peace\nAnd usually for the most part you just replace you can just replace the gas getting put remain ceiling and put it back together but you're going to do a bigger repair a lot of money a lot of time to just better to buy a whole new plate gasket in seal and\nAnd are you a good quality one don't skip on that I'm going to do I still want to do it twice and that's that's probably your\nBiggest leak but you know the first thing she got to do is almost haven't cleaned off to determine for sure worst ... that's not a repair you want to guess at at it you know eleven twelve hundred bucks\nCorrect but at its peak\nAnd speaking of the oil pressure sense or I'm a about a year ago um ... pressure and sort of went\nWell yeah I Do kind of a a but there there's this truck I I don't

now but there's this one where the doctors were you never saw anybody's face of the whole episode the doctors are working on all these patients and and like plastic surgery type of thing and try to make this person you know\nWell good enough for public I mean this this person so hideous that he can't even be released to the public et cetera\nAnd or you don't see anybody's face the whole time the doctor is all you see is a hands and the coats and all that kind of stuff\nAnd finally at the end they say well let's see if we've repaired her see if it took an they open it up or they take the you know deal of her face and uh she's beautiful you know a young lady and and everybody gas and then and then you turn on you see that all of the\nDoctors and so forth they all have this hideous oh wow and so forth where you know kind of the beauty is in the eye of the beholder kind of it\nIs really an interesting show I Love the show I thought I mean there's always something\nYou know I had no idea you're such a fan I watch that episode it probably wouldn't be TV today and good in another way yeah\nI think it's still I still think that show does hold up I thought you were going to go with where everyone turned out to be pigs there was an episode where all of a sudden everybody has a pig and then you're going to pig Malian thing\n... you know I don't remember what everybody's face looked like but I Do remember it being a they were particularly hideous I'll tell you what I bet you that you can handle the twilight zone stuff about the black mirror stuff as fast as probably agree yeah crazy for me 'cause they go crazy with the stuff now\nYou know there was a couple of episodes of black near where it really disturbs me and I had to sit back and go oh my gosh what just happened\nI don't think people watch it then let's don't also less now [laughter] good wholesome entertainment [laughter]\nGood wholesome disturbing let's go do what are you got for tribute we have with the natural things to talk about here\n\nWe go from the twilight zone things onto a song called twilight zone and a lot of people think that the name of the song is when the bullet hit to develop but it's actually called twilight zone do you know the name of this artist by the way\n... golden earring excellent so there are a Dutch band they had another huge hit which came about nine years earlier which was about cars radar love\nOh I Love that song yeah exactly it's another great song too and it goes on for eight minutes song too\nBut I found a down in the lab we were going over golden airing 'cause this is the first time we've ever gone over this band before and I find out all sorts of great stuff in the lab about bands and it turns out that song twilight zone people think it's about the movie or the the TV show how I\nSee I mean it it seems like it's a no brainer but they give homage to it in the song they say they you know they kind of give it prompted that but actually this song twilight zone from golden earring is inspired by a Robert ... book ...\nAnd I'll give you one little clue after this is Hollywood made five installments of the series of this\nYou can tell me that in fact the first one came out in two thousand and two and the last one came out in two thousand and sixteen and I'm how I can give you one more clue and it'll give it away but if you can't think of it I Will so what what action series did this inspire that\nTo being about a guy who has gone through a lot in life and comes to accept it said no I think that music needs to be real like that because people sometimes feel doomed and they're not necessarily whether love or something else\nBut he had to change it to get the record companies certainly said\nWhat a great song it was a great great great I Love that song of objects and brown did run something by you hear all the time it strategist get adviser guy with all the fancy letters and numbers behind his name and I'm just a radio person here I'm just Iran you know more than\nI Know that people often base their Social Security claiming date on the total amount of money that they think they'll net over their lifetime and then my way to look at things for sure and you guys do personalized Social Security acts implants help you figure that out every single day\nBut the full says it also depends on your investment strategy and they say that people who invest in stocks it might be better off for them to claim their benefits as early as they can\nIs that true should we be claiming Social Security early Ted I ... I don't I don't understand why this is going\nWell you know you could take a\nA number of different ways number one if you're owning some stocks are going to have some fluctuating value aren't you in other words you if you if you haven't put sure it's been ... there's a lot of variables to this question if you're only some stocks and their dividend paying stocks for example then maybe you could say well that is going to\nKnow that could generate income for me and in lieu of Social Security I can let my Social Security cook you know for a longer on the other hand you could say well no if I'm if I'm only some small kept stocks are they gonna fluctuating value you know my more widely\nSo since I don't know really what the value is going to be in any given time and not paying dividends either a well maybe I'll go ahead and claim my Social Security so I'm not real sure what they're getting at there to be honest with you I can tell you that when we do a Social Security\nAnalysis and we have software for that or when we very simply put in different Social Security strategies\nInto our software in other words we know what the strategies are there's spousal you no option et cetera and so when one spouse files these days usually file and suspend and then the other spouse would you know restricted application mullet dry\nWell all that changed a couple of years ago and now there are still filing options are still the spousal bucket you know which a lot of people don't even know about surprisingly uh enter walking right past when they come in the opposite might be sixty years old and I'm saying well why in the world are you guys know pulling\nYou know some kind of Social Security here or something going on to maximize this and they just don't know that they could have done that you're a while back\nBut even when the software says here's the\nDesired strategy the software is great software don't get me wrong Social Security strategy software\nAnd anybody can figure that out anybody could go on line and say well what's my maximum you know Social Security strategy you know here's here's my numbers and here's our ages that's fine but that presumes that you are functioning in a bubble that presumes that all you have is Social Security and the singular question is\nWhat is the best route for you to maximize your Social Security over your lifetime right and\nWell that really could mean absolutely nothing in the end because you can Trump that immediately and say I don't care what that says because number one you were presuming that I'm going to live past eight Seventy eight and a half\nAnd nobody in my family is look past Seventy five and I'm In the same physical shape as my mom and dad so that kind of throws that read out the window you know another person might say I don't care what you say about allowing my\nEr about uh let's say taking my Social Security later et cetera\nOr earlier and their main focus might be I'm going to take my Social Security early and here's why I don't want to spend my money when I could take my money out of the social because that is also your money right right so Social Security has your money you need to first of all get that through your head\nBut you can't leave your Social Security\nTo your kids I bet you fail once they're gone it's gone sure\nBut you can leave your own life saving so some people would argue I I really don't care I'm not going to put myself in a position\nWhere I'm not leaving the kids the maximum thing as a big driver for me and so I'm going to take my Social Security now striking that my other stuff cook and I know that I Would I Would have a larger Social Security payment later and blah blah blah but I don't really really care and so there's some things when you do these calculations that will Trump\nThe other and you'll you'll just say I could care less it's no different than than saying should I pay\nMy mortgage you know well yeah no you shouldn't pay off your mortgage give up liquidity when you have a low interest rate loan us tax deductible but then you Trump that and you say\nBut I feel better and I sleep better at night if I don't know more than ... and ... yeah and you have to put a there's a value out of that so they're very commonly there'll be times when we will run a Social Security ... for the software or we'll just use what we know is the preferred route\nAnd then when we actually go and plug that into the system was the family's actual circumstances\nThat I'm surprised it doesn't happen all the time but occasionally be surprised a lot it does make sense that if we put you in a vacuum that this is the preferred route on the social but because of your particular situation whether it's taxes because Social Security tax the same way as as other income like you're\nA you know on the eighty five percent of the subject attacks and so forth and versus your IRAs or you know taxes ordinary income tax rates so there's all kinds of little variables that come into play where you say you know what\nI Know that's what the Social Security software says but let me show you what happens if we do this the other way in your case and let's look at the future of value down here in Fifteen Years\nIn other words what you're going to have laying around and in a lump sum whether it's your own money to use as you wish short or leave the kids or something like that and you have a larger lump sum Fifteen Years from now for doing something that the Social Security software said was not the preferred route yeah\nOkay so it's it's all individual is what we say you got to do the math and you got to do it on an individual basis and this is another reason why it's really dangerous in any profession to like ... ... yeah blanket in these general as a as I was like you know my my knee hurts you know over here on this side so that must be actual\nHow about an X ray yeah and let's go check it out and find out what the real answer is not suppose you know so\nAnd that's why they're on the team do things like\nX rays the X rays four one K. X rays anything you have they can give it a financial X ray and see where you stand specifically with Social Security they do personalized Social Security action plans and they do that as part of the overall planning that they do but if you would like to see what's most beneficial\nBased on the numbers and have them run the numbers with their software they're happy to do that at no charge for you listening here in Omaha bits over fifty and it makes sense for you to look at that as part of your conversation\nJust call the office for zero to nine three two two one for one there's no charge for that for zero to nine three two two one for one there's a new survey by presidential finding that the most common financial worry today is never being able to retire\nI to tell them but this is not new I mean surveys have been highlighting the same concerns for\nSeveral years even before I started doing the show if you do all this has always been the concerns sold over here but I'm Wondering okay so this has been the same concern all these years\nWe aren't making much progress as a country I guess what some actual steps that our listeners today here in and around Omaha can take that would give them a more confident financial future instead of being part of that\nWorrying you're never going to be able to retire\nWell it takes us back to the what we were talking about I think in the last segment which is delayed gratification and\nAnd they'll get in your ducks in a row and living under your means as opposed to just at your means and uh you know do your folks if you have successful folks that are look like they're ready to retire and do so and style and they don't seem to be too stressed out about anything and and they don't ... I'm looking at price tags very much\nUs because we have some money in the bank and the reason the money to the bank is because over the years they they made some sacrifices and they they lived well within their means my dad's the number one piece of advice that I remember more than anything else\nGrowing up was live within your means ah when I saw him paying bills and so forth I asked him what he's doing and what does the tax what does it ... what is that even mean you know\nAnd began to get acclimated you know his piece of advice was us and you go to live within your means you've got to have some dollars left of the other piece of advice but he gave me that\nStuck with me was don't forget to take another loaf of bread out of the freezer when\nYou're under last couple of soy sauce on TALK of couples I Know that's pretty good at their own life that good advice thinking ahead\nTo their own kind of an old lady I'm One of these people that still freezes bread it's because I live alone and a loaf of bread goes along with all last year month exactly have longer than that if I really needed to but you're right though I mean I'm joking but those are the types of things that make people wealthy isn't paying attention to\nWhat seems very little that little stuff adds up and so you're listening today are worried you're never going to be able to retire\nA stop thinking so negatively but don't be so blind to it\nCan get help with that see or you stand that's the bottom line\nDo you need a million dollars maybe maybe not do you need more than that maybe maybe not it depends on your lifestyle it depends on so many different variables there on the team can help you figure that out with that portfolio X ray\nDuring a risk returning the analysis of every single investment you have whether it's for one case IRAs stocks bonds mutual funds pensions they'll look at inflation for the future make sure you're planning for that and\nIs your portfolio tax efficient now there's some changes you should be making what about health care cost moving forward based on your family history do you need to account for that how much all the options with Social Security we've talked about that\nThey can help you make sure that your income plan matches your needs your watch for your wealth now and in the future and there's no charge for that\n\nBonding heavy materials to vertical surfaces requires an adhesive with grabbing power you can trust\nType bonds ultimate tight grab it used to live as an advanced formula with twice the initial vertical bonds drank the most others similarities uh just press the work into a place and go type grab the game changing it he says that lets you bond heavy materials to vertical surfaces with confidence\nAvailable at select lows locations type on dot com for details\nRight now at the Home Depot save up to thirty five percent on appliance special by GOP wondering when the best time to buy it because it's now a GE Appliances side by side they mature refrigerator mounted nine hundred Ninety eight dollars\nThese days over five hundred bucks on a bridge with adjustable absorb them for ... big door and bigger saving now's the time to save up to thirty five percent\nAppliance special ... at the Home Depot of course they were\nAbout Seventeen us only lost by glass door\nIs no secret that leaves and your daughter will cost ... inexpensive water damage\nSki voters flowing and reduce cleaning the easiest leaf guard I recommend it for years to go to Russia just let three foot sections into your gutters and leave them there for a fact of affordable year round protection using it all yourself no tools study or faster to learn more and request a priest apple and\nBy direct got her brush dot com or call eight eight eight three nine\nSeven ... three three made in the U.S any guarantee got a rush dot com\nYour nose nursery poultry sales happening now with fifty two forty sound powder Ninety second street old two inch caliber trees must go two hundred and sixty dollars plane than a hundred and sixty dollar pick up your nose nursery just south of ... your ... nursery oh\nHis fixing the metal roof on your building still on your list of things to do then I'm roping has expanded into the Lincoln Fremont and West Point area this is Eric ... let's get back in the ... dot com or call for all to join nine forty seven Seventy six\n... camp stimulating\nHappening here you are sharing a day's news radio living tin ... said be happening now now you are hearing it now local\nNational land worldwide coverage day's news radio\nEleven ten K. at the beach now\nIs always just ... days and news radio eleven ten K. if they\nBe showing yell and inviting you to join the Oscar online show this and every Friday night during the football season from six to seven right here on big red radio ...

brush her a\nPipe cleaner giant ahah yeah but if you go to go to brush dot com they have some great videos but um you basically just shoving into the gutter and fly to down and put it in the next one and and bought 'em tight together that's good that's key though um you want to but I'm tied together only me space in between but they'll keep the leaves out and and you know keep the water flowing freely which is what you really is the most important part\nYeah it really is a good system and all and you know this time of the year two people are starting to should be thinking about um you know if you can get new windows if you have obsolete windows that are not insulated\nThat's always something to to budget and think about you may only be able to you know afford to do one side of the house at a time or you know dumped two sides of the house at the time and then do the others later but another thing that um years and years ago we started introducing the idea of a window insulating kit\nAnd a duck brands always been there with these really nice\nKits that you basically have the double stick tape you put around\nThe inside trim the house you put a small piece of a thin piece of plastic over at that comes in the kit and then you take the hair dryer and kind of Shrink Rap it\nAnd and nowadays they they've gotten to where it's just about invisible but will really provide the same properties that had double insulated window does would that air gap and they're really easy to install very inexpensive but now the brand has is max window kid\nThis pretty is is that they they refer to it as very pet friendly because it's a little thicker so that if you have you know cats or dogs that might kind of um interfere with the center type of plastic this holds up really in\nOr something it ducked ran dot com that people can find and that works so well it works really well summer and winter but\nEspecially when that cold areas sneaking in and around those old wooden windows or obsolete windows can really saved me a lot of money and make those those rooms a lot more comfortable so a lot of little simple things like that\nYeah I think you may have seen is Danny but sometimes people have especially older double hung windows and it feels cold but they don't really feel that there's much of a draft where you put on one of these duck brand kept on the inside a ha ha and suddenly it starts at ... a little bit\nYou know that's an air ... air pushing against this thing and you mentioned that air all being blown into your house it is a great way to block it right there and keep it from coming in and once you put this inflating kid on the\nGlass you know the cover up the the south by another trend she'll around the outside of the term you'd be surprised how much air can leak in from around the trim the casing the molding around the windows and that you can simply clock to block that as well\nBut you know another thing is of the socket Steelers this then people don't even think about Africa yeah any of those some out outlets electrical outlets or switches that you have on the\nInside of your home but on the outside wall\nJust to do nothing but take the plate off of it and to put these gas get there called socket sailors you can also find those at the Rand dot com\nAnd you can put that on and then put the plate right back I'm Talking about ... seconds not even turn into power off necessary and go around the perimeter of the house again is the baby steps it's a small things to really stop that air infiltration it makes a\nBig difference in the comfort and how much it costs you to keep your home comfortable\nRight you would never I don't know if the average woman would even think that that's a place for air to leak in but he is growing hold your hand up against some of those outlets as electrical outlets on ... and you'll feel that they're cold you know I actually I've even seen where there's been like a shadow like a black ish gray shadow around it\nOn the wall like what is that right well that's from the air passing through and it's blowing up dust or dirt or whatever\nThat's right and just accumulates around there yeah\nYeah so um you know if you see any of those signs it's colder there's dust or dirt yeah you've got to get one of these Steelers\nExactly that will help a lot a lot of little things are going to share with
