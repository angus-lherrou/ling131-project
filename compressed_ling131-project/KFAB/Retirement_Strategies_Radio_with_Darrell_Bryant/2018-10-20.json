that back I'm a look at it 'cause I don't think of headed ... took the wheel or looked at my daughter's relatives are shiny and smooth how come I verified it post calendars are sticking\nOr not I don't think they are\nOkay go ahead first of all the road or did you look the outside or do you look at the back side I felt most fine\nOkay All right 'cause a lotta times rotors will be nice and shiny up front in kind of be eliminating impeding on the backside\nI I don't know you know why I guess it's just more common for the backside to to do that so okay and it's common for with all the salt and everything else or to have a bunch of ... in the lemonade and it kind of coming apart and and a\nBoy ... ... what kind of symptoms where you have and let's start school at that\nYou know why am I didn't look happening I didn't have any symptoms okay\nUm this kind of caught me off guard 'cause like I'm a I didn't have any symptoms so\nI'm not sure how to verify that they're stuck on cars and drives find it doesn't ... when I break after our break it comes right down the road if I go on the steering wheel and go straight OK okay um\nWell usually a sticking caliber you'll have a one road or or the other the other got hot spots in it okay and you just see 'em you know a bluish tend to um sometimes you see within scrape you know just like it was a lotta heating and friction has developed\nDeveloped on the heat and that and that's typically how you'll see\nOh okay you know we're not having a problem I I Will say there is a fair amount of all that going on as far as the Gallup are sticking and uh we we are trashing rotors yeah what's the ... the writer\nProbably toast okay if I have\nTo have them on him up on safety jak behind the wheel or and I can I can actually before I took the ... if I could turn 'em when we weren't thinking when they were sitting in my garage\nTypically they won't it it usually that is a case where you get up\nAnd you start after the the brakes have been warmed up and everything it spans a little bit the road or it spans a little bit the caliber is a little bit that's when you start having a sticking issue the only time that stick out of coal is when their stock and there's just no doubt about it\n[laughter] yeah\nSo I take it out and take it out driving pretty aggressively you know and ah get get the brakes heated up real well and the first thing I knew was kind of go around and steal each we'll see if one we'll is just significantly hotter than the other\n... if they're all cool you know fairly cool to the touch all the same temperature seems like you then you can Jack it up and move your wheels around and see whether or not they're actually sticking\nOkay so and and I will\nYou know as I've mentioned maintains mark I mean we're becoming\nAre becoming the Minnesota Minneapolis you know I'm the brass ... and then we've got so much salt in the right here is just rushing up everything underneath the car everything when it comes in contact with everything that comes in contact with the breaks the\nBrake lines the ... or you name it just exhausted just getting worse and worse and worse\n... yeah I don't really want to tackle the change in California myself\nNow they can be that they're not too tough to to change it it's really the\nThe bleeding and sometimes you got a procedure and in order to change all that that's really the bigger problems so yeah if you're doing all that and you're driving it aggressively and everything seems to be free than I don't know that I Would worry too much about it until such time and do you do have a problem\nOkay very good um I I Want to know All right I Am good good luck with the guys stick with the callers let's talk to John John good morning\nHey how are you today good good what what's the last\nBecause of the salt sorry\nGuys finally get away without saying that guy is All right I just had the dropping out of you good for business but it just kind of drives you that you know [noise] so uh\nA lot of different things that that can be come up with that particular code in what you have to do and visual inspection of the mission control system front to back sometimes the the the problem is very obvious as what you had to replace sometimes you have to do what they call a smoke test smoked test fills the entire system full of the\nSmoke smoke that has nitrogen in it and you'll literally see it kind of smoking out any kind of cracks or or or problem spots that that would cause that particular coat and then you go in and repair those\nAnd or your chicken July goes away to take care of the problem [noise]\nAnd it it's a fairly benign problem as far as the check engine light being on but if you don't go in and solve the problem\nAnd talk and um [noise] the lights not going to go out and sometimes it's easy to find that it's a very small league they can be kind of difficult to find because it's it's just a very very small leak largely because it's very obvious signs so\nThis was one of those is this one of those gas kept things\nIt can be one of those gas cap things yes where are you can the next ... is a metal and it kind of gets arrested or gets a kind of a little bit of corrosion around it and the rubber just doesn't feel very well sometimes the rubber on the gas cap is just broken into work mhm and deteriorated deteriorated and uh you put a new gas cap on and\nSometimes the easiest way to start the easiest place to start this is when the gas cap on it is in queen ... make sure that it's nice and clean and fits tight and use a ... um oh yeah\nOh yeah yeah we always used the original equipment gas cap [noise] um it just seems like the repair is much better when you use that particular quality for sure All right so the answer that question let's move on to ... with no nine cobalt Kelly mourning\nMourning a yeah quick question I'm In a situation here I'm going to my college and ah they called me last night and the battery is obviously dead\nSo I got jumper cables I'm thinking just ... ... a\nPositive or cable up the battery is the alternate are\nWorking what should I Do their first of all how old is a battery well I don't remember I Know two or three years old gas or\nIf you think it's a few years old is probably more like four years old so you're do\nPossibly okay well here's the other question uh he doesn't drive as much during the week and he's got an ... to it you think that it would be drawn hour of that battery do\nWell not usually and I you know depends on how they hook goes up normally would hook them up on what would be called the accessory side do damp wouldn't POWER UP until the keys on\nRight well I thought I was thinking yeah but there's always something drawing on the battery you you never get away from something drawing on the battery more should be starting at them yeah well anyway\nIt's just a very small amount but if it fits for months if it sit for a month on you know at one time then it ... and the reserve capacity inside of an old batteries it can be\nTerrible okay so I was best thing to do the job but then shot tested or yeah yeah\nYeah they get over to a a um\nYou know ah I don't know if you don't garage in the area that you're doing it to or or just take it all real parts store and say can you checked his battery and we check the bolted to the old men are real quick\nAnd I ... the average life of a battery nationwide is about three and a half years roughly so anything over top of that and it's part of the country it's it takes much more abuse obviously you know from a hundred degrees down to\nMinus and it's been are kind of what we ran into as if you think it's two years old it's actually for [noise] [noise]\nYeah well I don't really know what I'm old I'm getting old so I've been for so\nSo so you're doing I guess my point there is that because it's do\nLet's avoid a problem and put a battery in it yeah and you may end up putting an alternate Iran too but you're gonna need to put a battery and yeah you're right good luck with that Kelly I don't know how to combat [noise] about sounds like they're playing our song did us another edition of the

I Would say it's probably eight eight thirty six\nOkay All right nice big long southern porch there so now when you're standing at your front door and looking out are the boards running left and right or are they running straight out\nThere last year right okay um [noise]\nThat's one of the challenges because uh it prevents water from running off directly\nAs it would if it was running straight out because the water hits it it flows ride out so you're probably getting a little bit of pooling water though miner\nThat's one of the things is making it a little harder certainly you mentioned the sun which is never going to make it easy to to keep paying on it and so forth so that's uh that's one of the other things and I assume it's probably a tongue in groove type of flooring\nSteadfast Fort\nOkay are so it was five quarter by six okay so so do you so you have drainage so watered drips between the boards under your porch he does\nOkay All right here we go All right so one of the things that I Would do is I'm certainly the preparation of any um surface that you're going to paint is going to be very important\nAnd um so if you use whether it's a mechanical sander of some type or a lotta times I'll tell you what a lot of people use is what we call a poll sander appeal Wally poll sand or that the guys that do drywall\nUse it has a handle on it about four or five feet long has a little sanding pad that's about three inches by eight inches and they use it the sand the drywall will tell you that makes it really easy to sand a wood floor like this without you know I'm a spending too much time on and I would use an\nEighty grits sand paper go with the grain to you're going to be going left or right\nAnd you're not you're not trying to take all the pain off you're just trying to catch it and trying to smooth out a little bit and trying to I'm just getting loose paint that you may have 'em off of that surface then you're wiping it down well use a mop that try to keep you off your knees as much as possible there\nThen the real key thing at this point since you have a problem situation is to use a good quality bonding crime or\nAn ex cheery you're bonding primer now what that does is it all kind of a lock in everything lock and whatever you have there the the the residual this left all the deck it'll kind of locking in really well\nAnd you're ready to put a good quality porch and Dick enamel on top of that\nNow I'm not sure what you've used in the past but this combination um it really works really well the bonding primer will will really do create a really good surface for the porch and decker ... and I think you'll see that it'll hold it better than it ever has before that makes sense\nIt does do you have a preference between ah latex or oil based\nWell I'll tell you I've always enjoyed using the um oil base hum on something like this but there are there's a lot of um\nArgument or discussion in that the acrylic late Texas have more um let's say elasticity\nSo when you have those cold mornings and hot afternoons because of the sun you got a lot of movement in the woods so I Will say the acrylic late taxes that are available in the porch and decker ... right now are better than they've ever been before\nSo and it's a lot easier to use 'em and you don't have so much of a dry and time issue so I think either way he's really good I I don't know I I I've been using a lot of latex lately and and that's probably a um might be a good way for you to go a lot more to do it yourself friendly\nThank you so much really appreciate your child\nOkay Lisa sorry a little frustrated there but I think I think this will help you a little bit I used to have my okay\nThank you as well appreciate your being part of the show you know I always think about that with a there's problem areas of your home and things that uh you know you just checked trot everything what can you do\nUm I really um I I ... I I take that serious when someone asks a question like that about what can I Do I'm tired of doing this and\nYour front of your house you know you want that would someone walks up to your house you want it to be a very welcoming feeling you don't want anyone to see\nDead flowers and peeling paint and that kinda thing and that can be quite a challenge\nTo prevent that but I'll tell you what would the holidays coming up it's a great time to think about those curb appeal projects and boy if you want some great informational some really low cost curb appeal improvements freer home today's homeowner dot com is the place to go we've got some great ideas\nFor you some things that you can make a big difference very little money it might surprise you hey thanks so much for being with us here today is home on or we're going to take a short break we'll be [noise]\nHopefully\nThey made it nice [noise]\nIt's no secret that leaves and your daughter will cause clauses inexpensive water damage\nSki voters flowing and reduce cleaning the easiest leaf guard have recommended for years to go to brush and just let three foot sections into your gutters and leave them there for effective affordable year round protecting its using is all yourself no tools study or fasteners to learn more and request for example if I direct", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement Strategies Radio with Darrell Bryant", "city": "Omaha", "day": "20"}
