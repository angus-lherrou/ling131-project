stopped stopped cranking I could still hear the sound like a relay but no quick [noise] so I looked at the store\nAnd saw the copper between us so annoyed starter which corroded almost all the way

belt wine on any of the other police ah so I'm kind of battle washed or to go to next\nSo replacing the starters Robert ... is a great start because of that corrosion that's going to be there that was going to be a problem ... you just solved it right now so yeah so um so do you hear the stars are engaged or hit the flywheel\nA no no nothing just this kind of relate type sound but no clicking or no real attempt to switch to try to engage\nYou've got power good power and everything else\nWell I haven't put a meter on it yet but I Will put a meter on the starter and check points there\nThe first thing to do is um and I'm sure you may be already done this but make sure the battery cables are are really clean not so much on the outside on the inside but have a battery cables as they get ... they get ... on on the post were the post start off with nice fresh led same with the the battery cables\nAnd then over time they get they don't necessarily look dirty but the the the art back and forth the electricity is art back and forth\nSo make sure you clean out the battery cable real well make sure you clean out the the er\nThe battery itself real well that may not solve your particular problem but again it's going to solve a problem that's somewhere down the road somewhere down the road and very common and a lot of common things can solve your problem the next thing to do is you need to go down to start or need to check to see if you're getting any voltage down there\nOkay obviously on the the big terminal you're going to want to ...\nAnd then when you turn the key over you're going to want to ... at that starter so annoyed terminal the terminal ... yes so if you're not getting any voltage there so what we're trying to determine their is if we're getting voltage down there and whether it's just ... I don't really use a test like you're probably going to use the ... meter\nSo are we getting anything okay if and yes we're getting something down there okay the twelve old a ... you know or or ... maybe you got a connection problem you're not getting anything then you've got to go back up the stream and then you've got to say OK\nNeutral switch ignition switch a dart or\nRelay a computer's also involved in that too so you're going through\nThis started really and then you're going through the computer on that on that late model car so maybe the computer's going through the computer's not sending a signal down there\nSo you kind of have to work backwards a little bit and kind of see where you're at A M started really if there's a started really in there and I can't think off ... off my head if there is reason but a lot of the newer cars have started relays yeah I think there is\nYou can switch that started we look in your fuse box and a lot of them are to use the same relays for a lot of different things you can switch that started really over for a different related to the box seats\nThat's all you're probably okay\nBut you got you got to start by seemed to got power down there okay it's not uncommon to have maybe um the computer having issues not uncommon to have a ... that's used box to have a problem because it's a multi layered fused box now it's not just a plug in on the top and wire on the bottom and goes to a middle layer that can go bad\n... that's that's how your progression going to need to work\nOkay\nAnd you don't need to try neutral\nI did okay try in general in the uh after the arm for putting in driving park okay\nSo we can probably eliminate that um then it goes from ignition switch to the started really and maybe through the computer and then down to start or so\nAnd and you can get a you want to you can get a probably a wiring diagram right off of ride right off line you know Google that and put it on maps and type in your car and you can get a a diagram it shows you exactly where that goes through that where you're not searching around\nOkay\nYou've found with all your progression of mhm were that voltage supposed to be going if you don't have power and on the starter\nRight to just terminal that's obviously it's got it's got to start it's got to have the power to that as terminal when you turn the key otherwise it's not get engaged starter\nAlright okay she's\nOkay you guys helped me on a a a few weeks ago on a two thousand three dodge quad cab [noise] um where I had a small leak to the operator canister in\nThat you know ... and I got down underneath and looked at it and found that probably a critter chewed through one of the hose so there you go yeah and I replaced it knocked the light out and it stayed off so\nGood oh good good well if you have any problem more problems with this let us know weren't happy they okay thank you good luck with that\n\nSo that's kind of he just going to have to find out whether or not he's got power down the starter and if he does come trace it back from there yeah member the old days when when from ignition switch to start or I can remember the old days we used to cross those terminals will receive a crank call the old days you just step on a pedal [laughter]\nAnd just okay that's what I needed a no hitter thank you\nAnd we'll go to Randy with gas in a diesel engine Randy good morning\n... a big uh well for a I'm a ... or ...\nTrucks and nobody but a gasoline and diesel engine would that be the engine\nFirst of all did you take the diesel Doug gasoline back out\nNot yet okay doesn't run at all no don't dry\nRuns got a crappy when you do but uh the only thing you can do and we've done there's more than once I'm is drain it all out flush it all out bleed it all out and\nAnd uh do your best to get it started\nHave you have you rent it since you put the gas in\nYou know okay on but you tried running\nNo damage charges started lately\nOkay ... did it start and run and then die or just never tried it at all\nAs far as I Know it it it deal it died in getting\nOr they're all on that for a while in\nOkay character builder and it's not like ... all\nRight All right so that that was my question had to random because if you just put gasoline and diesel truck and you had and ran and you just suck it out and put diesel fuel back out and you'll probably be fine but if you've rented now ran that these are the gasoline through the fuel system now you've got a problem where you're going to have to flush it and\nChange the filters and bleed it out and in fact some lines and you just gotta get fresh diesel all the way up to the ... and a kind of make a mess and so\nYou know it's just leading it all out and once you do and\nWhat's in the tank if you suck it all out and what's in the tank you're probably okay if you mix of the diesel fuel\nWith it depending\nOn how much you get out\nOf that tank pretty empty you know if there is a gallon gasoline in the thirty gallon tank or something like that that racial is probably fine but the fact of the matter is that you ran down gasoline up through all your fuel lines into your ... and stuff like that and that's going to be a problem\nBut what what ... what was due to the engine most of the time you come back out of it once you get all of the diesel back in there and get it actually started again it it probably won't do any major damage\nOr or I've never seen one I'm sure can it's it's certainly possible but it's all you take the neck okay you\nBought or you know that he will back into the system\n[noise] well yeah you just gotta bleed it all out and uh you I mean you get all the way to the injector so you gotta you just gotta get every little bit it out of there because it doesn't like to run on fuel only once ... once it wants do you\nFeel [noise] okay thank you oh you bet their lights sometimes getting um started after that is quite a challenge to make sure the

I was thinking of the uh the purple lurk smoke on the water we have a\nQuestion we have I Can't remember we have done that ... exactly\nI just had to go through the lyrics until I get to that [laughter] yeah yeah All right I got one Doug\nWith with your with your a subtle educating along the way and hence that's right you know we've got to make it interesting I Want the audience to learn something about music and also about retirement there yeah and well rounded and so we can Frankenstein you a good retirement\nA dad jokes than we are slowly okay here we go [laughter] so there was a a\nLittle known van ... ah went by the name of a van Halen never heard of them and uh their original singer was day they'll either off yes and uh now David Lee Roth being the original singer was this an interesting story about he how he became the lead singer okay so what happens\nTo the band okay the ban is very poor okay and some of the story do you know anything about how he was finally selected to be the lead singer at this fledgling band at the time\nWell actually it was kind of interesting because\nBefore he was in van Halen or David Lee Roth came from a prominent family that and uh they used to raise Basset hounds and he inherited a lot of money off Basset hounds but his tongue to pass me is\nThat why are you there I I was going wow we're about to get a real\nAsset [laughter] another while\nJulia Roberts forced to star in that to the trivia about her and I'm not asking for an answer here Darryl telling you that although it is not around so you could surprising what this later maybe she is very pretty Julia Roberts no doubt about that still is but that is not really her that you see in the famous pretty woman\nMovie poster it is in fact her head but superimposed on a picture of a body double they wouldn't do that with doing all they do that and all they would they did that and I feel sorry for men because I Know that poster with very popular for a lot of reasons and it was a complete lied to all of you know\nI Can't imagine anybody actually doing that that's the probably live and now the movie poster ...\nThat's right I tell ya I tell you I Love movies it's my favorite thing to do oh my gosh you and dug yes and and you can have a big of a movie guy but you see most of the big blockbuster movies remember Jerry Maguire have you seen that one\nActually running again on HBO I just watched it just it I'm Sorry it came out in Nineteen Ninety six you know I mean no I just watched it again okay yeah well the funny I forgot about some of that I was a youngster man it was before\nHe was really annoying to I loved it it was great that we all remember back in Ninety six and we saw Jerry Maguire break away from the corporate world and make it as an entrepreneur\nShow a\n\nLot of that one day I'm going to call your office and just said they're all ...\nYeah that was simply who's sitting in his is corporate office or whatever and it has a you know and then it was a Cuba Gooding Cuba Gooding junior yeah she was getting in and uh yeah walking around the kitchen and yeah they both did a great job and that\nWill today in real life more than thirty million Americans own a small business and as I say that it reminds me that Daryl you're one of those thirty million Americans not the D. Bryant retirement strategies as a big but it's small business standards it's an independent from just here in Omaha\nYou know helping other people with retirement but they did a survey saying that thirty four percent of these small businesses the owners have put retirement savings on the back burner because they're so focused on growing their business\nSome are counting on just selling their business to fund their retirement since you yourself are also a small business person you're not a major corporation you got identify with it there I mean you're not going anywhere anytime soon in fact I envisioned you being one of those guys it's always going to be doing this but\nJust to entrepreneur is here in and around Omaha when it comes to retiring\nWell you know first of all you're going to need to have an exit strategy in terms of the business itself what do you mean exit strategy well in terms of what you're going to do to go you know you're going to want to prepare the business to be you know sold or\nWhatever the cases and have a valuation on that and you know we have people regularly coming into the office that say\nUh we work with two or three right now and uh there were right in the middle of planning and uh they have incomes are from the sale the business that may be starting you know next year or they are already going that maybe it's a lot of people will come in more than one business we had a couple of this weekend\nThat he's in a transportation business and every time we turned around I thought well people are making money every time I Do this I think I'm just going to start a company for that too so yeah so these entrepreneur thinking people that well that's what that's what we do you know and we just kind of think of\nGosh you know you don't think you're going to work for somebody spend so much as you think of I like to have a little business like that\nSo it's just a different way of thinking that that isn't a superior to it or anything some people don't want to have their own business but because it is a lot of headache\nNonetheless you know you're getting older you know he's somebody like the you know actually go do something instead of be at the shop all day long and\nAnd so you need to prepare for those things and have an exit strategy and have a plan in place perhaps some streams of income a lot of people when they retire and they sell their business they don't sell for a lump sum and walk away is is some form of a stream of payments over the years right\nDarryl this is my aunt kitty back home in South Carolina now that I think she's Ninety five and doesn't have anything to do with it anymore but she had a restaurant and when she sold it many moons ago she sold it not outright she still had a little bit of a stake in it and got famous show her time so that if somebody screws up she can also take it back\nAnd said it makes her her investment was a good one\nAnd so you want to look for the yeah and you want to work with a professional that knows how to structure those things and uh you know an attorney obviously and make sure everything is legal and finished and binding but you could have a lump sum come in and you could have a stream of income for a certain period of time you could have a stream of income and then a balloon payment after a period of time\nCould be that you want to sell to your kids and there's all kinds of ways that you would uh would do that in the meantime however you want to consider saving some money right now what's interesting to me by the way is if you're a business owner and you're showing too much income you don't get to do any of these things right\nNow there was a more money you make the less available certain\nRetirement plans are to you it's like I don't get to know you made too much money oh wow okay well I thought all the tax rates were for people that make too much money right and so that's what business owners will say when they walk you know I don't get to do this or that\nBusiness owners by the way are also kind of fraught with with a bunch of non ... dollars in other words since they couldn't stuff\nYou've had a successful business and since they couldn't stuff that a profit into\nA four one K. or an IRA or Ross or what have you then they have a whole bunch of non irate dollars laying around on the outside those non I already dollars are dollars that need to be managed very carefully because they are triggering an annual tax\nDividend income et cetera a capital gains a when you you know make a trade and this kind of thing so you might want to consider finding some form of a tax deferred rapper\nFor those non irate dollars and indeed make sure that you pay attention if you're\nIf you're a small business owner and you have non irate dollars and these brokerage accounts that you have lying around make sure that you're considering the frequency of trades within the account because that will trigger some tax bills possibly short term capital gains you'd want to avoid that and then also as we said in the last segment consider doing some tax loss harvesting\nIn that account as we just discussed in the last segment as well so that's a couple of things but back to just the typical things that a small business owner you know a little shop might consider\nYou could do is set by right and you know that's a a a simplified employee pension is what set stands for it's just for you know just kind of single shops you could do a solo four one K. if you're a really small shop if you're getting a little bigger but you have less than a hundred employees you might consider doing a simple\nIRA and just a number of things you still do Ross and things of this nature but you gotta be really careful because you have to select a plan that as is consistent with what you are able to do\nI have employees do I have to include them do I want to include them am I going to match you know how much is this thing and I asked to administer okay\nThese are difficult questions you know and you probably don't know the answer if you're a business or because you know your business right right and the stuff will probably escape you but certainly it does take some forward thinking more over then the employee\nBecame the employee does is goes to work does their job you know participates in the four one K. and goes home and and that's it you know a little more complicated for the business are\nSpending a different way because I'm thinking about\nPeople that come in the office at the Brian retirements strategy you have people that work for a major corporations you have people that are small business interests you have all different types of people and professions that come in and you also have this population\nOf people that we can't do without the people that are farmers to people that have a lot of land and that then their way of life and they're small business owners in a totally different way but that land is where their money is so when they retire that what they are\nWell typically they will figure out a way to generate income from that right so they'll cash rent et cetera and so that was a show that as a stream of income that lends itself to war the overall income need so they say well we sure would like to have a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year coming in\nBut with a ... you know the farm we have a you know there's about fifty thousand dollars and that to us coming in or whatever the number is on the way our Social Security's that's are known incomes toward that most farmers most land owners the last thing they want to do is give up that land\nAnd so they sell priceless it feels like will sure they're not making any right now it's there's only so much to go around right and people especially if it's a generational ownership\nThey are not going to let that go they're going to pass it on down to their heirs well this creates an enormous problems for a wealthy family with little cash a lot of wealth it's all tied up in real estate\nAnd then you have four kids well how are we going to do this yeah and so and then you have a couple of the kids they could they could care less about farming they had enough of that when they were growing up and they're living in Washington DC and you know down in Texas somewhere and they don't want anything to do the farm and yet they get twenty five percent of the farm\nAnd so it just complicates matters and this is why when you sit down the we had you had these questions of how are we going to do this and how much are we going to disclose your kids about what we have and what can what can they expect\nThese are really really important to pieces of information let me make suggestions you younger listeners out their younger meaning you know the thirty five forty five year old a sitter no we don't we don't generally work with those right age group but let me strongly encourage you\nIf you're listening and you don't think your folks listen to you know this kind of a show or know who we are please send them in to see someone to begin to put their retirement plan together whether they're the small business owner or just the employee it doesn't matter\nBut the reason I went there is because that child the offspring of the business owner okay\nWhat a difference of dark inmates to boost your

interested in taking them maybe ... or a workbench but uh we had a lot of kids' toys there had a lot of sporting um but you know good good things there and uh\nSo uh that it was a it was pretty easy to organize it once we once they went through their purging process and got rid of a few things they they made it a lot more manageable and in the house was only a year and a half old really a terrible it's terrible situation and then they had a fire that completely destroyed their previous home wow\nSo they started they had zero not the only thing they had as what they were wearing when they and they barely got out of the house\nIncluding grabbing the baby out of the ... running out when the house completely\nCompletely burned to the ground so now there is very unfortunate that she would never know it with a positive the positive attitude they rebuild an existing space or they know they they they moved to 'em because they had to get to a house pretty quick so they moved to a brand new house in a brand new um development subdivision\nAnd so they came in and you know so that they had to get back to normal as much as they could for you know for all the all the right reasons and uh but the garage nah we don't have time for that so it became a dumping ground out there but uh worked out pretty well you know another thing that I'm hearing more and more about\nIs people considering using metal roof on my brand new home and my boat house I'm putting all metal roofing on it in a while you start digging into it and are working with a lot of the folks from the metal roofing alliance and\nUm how they're trying to I'm kind of not down any of the misconceptions about metal roofing and um\nYou know and ... especially the extreme weather with rain and snow and all of that hails too yeah hail that's another really good one because the ... you know the metal roofing is so resistant to an ... you can have a a Steele roof a aluminum roof even copper you know a lot of different ways to go there and\nI'm also when you talk about these hurricanes and you know our our friends down in the\nNorthwest I'm Florida area they do really got hit by hurricane a Michael\n... of a metal roof will hold up to a hundred and forty miles per hour hurricane force winds and as we said hail storms heavy rains and also some of our friends on the west really love the metal roof because of his resistance to wildfires um you hear more about those and you ever have before it seems\nYeah I mean it's surprising how many homes have would roofs\nAnd yeah now that's traditional you know 'cause she comes from the northwest in ... in the Pacific northwest in redwood comes from northern California so what was it is available relatively affordable to do roofs but it seems like they've been having wildfires for a very long time so it's really surprised they're still putting on wood roofs\nPiano and so yeah no metal the way to go if you live in that area and those are seem to be every year there those wildfires him to be growing bigger and bigger and more often so yeah metal roof will be smart and if you're thinking of metal roof\nYou probably have this image of standing same room which is the most popular long vertical lines running from the up to the rich but they now have\nUm different styles that looked like shaker tile even asphalt so they come and lots of different colors and not just silver so um yeah go go to what is it a metal roofing dot com I think yeah uh-huh metal roof you know you have some really up to date information\nPretty good way to go there and

T. R.\nMicrowaves I'm just do that that just re circulate which is almost worthless now I'm the vast majority of kids do have adapter kids that are\nA lot of times they are basically built into the top of the microwave that you can you you basically you can look up the model number of your microwave and see if it has the ability to just is basically just flipping\nThis little vent on the top of you have to take it down to vent it that\nEarn it over and then you're able to have an adapter that will allow you to vent it to the outside day and now the rallying of that is what so key you want it to be the shortest distance possible and if you are coming up out\nOf your cabinet and turning into your garage and then going up out that's okay and just use a a good quality metal pie okay\nAnd that instead of a corrugated pie and um you should be able to get it out of there\nUm and that will improve drastically but it's not going to be quite as good as putting a traditional rain should in\nWhich um has a little bit of a bigger footprint and veteran motor and I'm so many many times actually an episode of our show that uh our television show that just aired recently we did that very thing is removed the the over the range\nThen we put a great range ... and they only hang located a smaller microwave I'm In another part of the kitchen so that's one alternative you might consider if you have another area for a microwave either on the counter or adapting to cabinet to accommodate it\nHadn't on an ... interesting okay to\nSandy in a day and I neither one of us really like those combination microwave vent units because it sounds like a great idea you know you should wear the microwave but it doesn't then very well and they never do so I think a better off\nGetting a dedicated rain showed that really can power out the all those voters and smoke and then just I mean unfortunately it means buying two new appliances ranges and another microwave but that in the long run I think you'll be happier with that [noise]\nOkay that's great I I don't think I can look at you and you're out what works best and now I like you get ... sounds great\nWell best of luck to you we don't want you to do without your steak and onions now that simple [laughter] enjoying the show\nAnd I got my grandkids to watch it to believe that at five and a half when they and three and a half\nOh good good will will inspire him and bring up some uh some great carpenters and and\nContractors from being able to be exposed to everything about it right and I'm like OK or pleasure and thank you very much\nPart we you know I'll tell ya Joe we're talking about indoor air quality in so many ways it so it might as well talk about October is indoor air quality month and we're celebrating where the great give away from our friends at Brown all month long brown has given away in in the sand ventilation fan\nOf these decorative fans are really easy to install actually have one in my own bathroom here and now it's very soup they're super quiet of course they have the built in light and all you have to do to win one of these very\nInnovative invent fans is to call her hotline one eight hundred non for six forty four twenty and say I need and invent make sure you leave a shrimp formation and best of luck to you own your opportunity\nTo win one of those Joe I'll tell you what the emails keep rolling in here and then writing grab us another one here see if we can help\nHelp out on Tom is in Medina, Ohio I have been done a number of times a Tom says we're installing a subway towel back splash in our kitchen I read that the first row of the towels must be level however my existing countertop is ten foot long and the slope\nFive sixteenth ... from the left to right and\nI hate when that happens do or maintain the slope or do I have to draw level on at the bottom and start from there I'm therefore the gr out um gap at the bottom where the towel meets the granite will be one sixteenth on one side Bob sixteenth on the right what do you suggest well I'm\nJoe you know you you've you've written a towel book so you you know year those you know than the expert on all of this but I'm just a few things to consider first of all you can't lay the towel crooked it has to be level\nAnd so you when you have these situations you're looking for the the the the way that you can do it with laced with it being a Middle East obvious that it is an level and of course if you could fix the countertop that's great what's best approach to this you think\nWell I'm seeing is email and he says that ... ten foot long and its slopes five sixty seven inch\nAnd you're right you don't want some setting your tiles freshly subway tiles with all all those vertical olives horizontal lines being way out of level but in my experience you're never gonna see five sixteenth of an inch over ten feet you're just not going to say I would say set the pile right on the countertop\nAnd just follow it and make your cuts all the cuts that will be because otherwise you're going to be cutting tile and that's gonna be noticeable in that first course and all the ... tiles that will be out of\nOut of levels so to speak will be hidden up underneath the cabinet and he mentioned that is a bad one saying where a\nTom mentioned setting the drought\nOn setting the ... on the bottom you don't want to set put grout under that tall with their ... tile meets a counter top bright silicon yeah because those two materials are gonna move separately so\nYou know where we have tile meeting something else you know another material um you what you might silicone there you go but I Would set it right on top of that first course right out you'll never noticed that being out of level over ten feet that's\nProbably the best way to go ... got to have a level you will always notice actual you'll feel like the floors cricket or something you don't want that but maybe it is maybe Tom's cooking is getting colder all\nOver the country and we're going to talk with everybody Christ Nielsen from the carrier corporation about a\nFew of the things that she needs to be concerned right here today so I'm On the radio [noise]\n\nYes
