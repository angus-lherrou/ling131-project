sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups\nRather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture the whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about bond offer\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solution not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation has faced their challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats we observe new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated a outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed I\nThink ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability\nThat we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus\nIn to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people and reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user tight were addicted to outrage right now\nAnd I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly to not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have stood up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know are trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger\nBecause they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate we're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... if it's kind of weird that appeals to\nThere's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm so for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the good those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you add some protest or on the side just telling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nAnd Christians in the age of outrageous is to just to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a wins some\nApproach and and and plan for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions are so let me take a quick break the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage I think it is really important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all\nJust strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are

welcome thank you good to be here yeah it is and\nWhat is on your mind today\nDid you ever see the the the TV show continuing did you watch on yeah I loved it yeah it was a great show yeah it was all about corporations running the world and the you're twenty Seventy or something\nYeah and I you know what I thought it was kind of silly at the time I have mocked Blade Runner and everything yeah Corp by to come on all scared of corporations yeah that's the that's the one thing the left had right\nThey might yeah they might have had it right in the right way right I mean they they are ... voice bad right now we are in the theater that is\nBy the worm everyone they put the flag with all the corporate logos on it and everything else I always thought oh please give it a rest but it is I mean you could put Amazon Google Facebook on the flag and eh pretty accurate\nYeah we ... we ... we now have and those are some that you mentioned we now have companies that are big enough to really fit fit that role I don't know that it that they do no not yet but uh Amazon in particular is just getting\nEnormous and I'm In the book the for the hidden DNA of Amazon Apple Facebook and Google\nAh the author talks about just how massive Amazon is a for instance far fewer us households have a gun than Amazon Prime thirty percent of sixty four percent holding a more Americans have primed and voted\nIn twenty sixteen only fifty five percent\nI'm more Americans have Amazon Prime then go to church\nA more have Amazon Prime than um than are in a monogamous relationship with a spouse\nWho should have said that about more Americans had NBC and CBS and ABC I mean maybe\nBut they're into so many other things to which you know you've got to consider that I'm a ... that they're they're into everything else like that I think it's fifty five percent of households now are sixty five percent of households have a Alexa\nOh at four years ago and ... why do we invited that surveillance indoor home if they want to use it that way and I don't know that they are but they\nAre they are recording they are recording the gas yeah recording it'd be really yet because they they it needs to a listen but it's also learning it's trying to learn how to communicate yes\nAnd they're they're reporting on our moods our tastes all the things we like all the things we want the things we need and our fears and they just report all of that back to a Amazon headquarters\nOr they just gobbled up whole foods right now and when they did kroger's stock went from thirty one dollars a share to twenty two [laughter] that's how big this company is wow they're going to be the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty\nUh they're already so more books than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business\nUm and there there are about to spend more on the original programming than even Netflix or they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] just so many things is it time to\nI mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as a capital is breaking up a company that's what they did the Microsoft that's what they did to or are they tried to to Microsoft has what they did with mountain bell I'm\nYvette mountain bill was in with the government\nI mean that was that was protected by the government and part of a you know that was that was a protected property you couldn't you couldn't start anything against them right that's why yeah I mean you know you could start on your own Amazon you're not get ill to compete\nBut I don't think there are other options you know there are other outages are just ... you know the problem is Amazon does everything better than everybody else you know this isn't real problem\nWe we've been talking about this whole week is I don't I don't want you to change Amazon I like Amazon I like Amazon Prime I like the fact and yesterday we were trying to build a stupid volcano for um my daughter and\nTony went and got a three percent hydrogen peroxide and we're reading and I'm like I think thirty five percent is a different kind of peroxide and it is I didn't I mean it's a dangerous kinds of peroxide [noise]\nUm and we didn't have it so I go online on like where can you get it Amazon [laughter] I mean it'll have you'll have tomorrow you know you had as ours I mean it's I don't want them to change some of these things\nYeah and and we're the same way with Google and Google's getting pretty intrusive things right but we were like their search engine yeah we're like their browser their mail is greater mail is great\nI mean like free and so we just we get it out or you've given at all I'm from Google Amazon you make the same argument Amazon controls I mean people are like oh well I buy a lot of things for Amazon and that's obviously a big part of their business wonder cloud computing is really the main thing driving all of their profit auto\nUm you know and it's a and so many places or use it\nEvery place you go on the Web based government young Amazon yeah I mean\nAnd it's like you know Alexa at this point is a\nIt's a luxury a product of moderate\n... utility right like I mean I feel like it's fun to play with like we use it as a speaker you ask if the weather every once in a while I mean there's a couple of things you can do it but I mean like I don't know is Alexa changing my life now as I Know rhino absolutely has changed my life yes yeah I mean it's ... I I ... from it yeah\nPrime time can deliver to your door within an hour yeah I mean\nYou could I think you could safely say Amazon has almost", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "14"}
