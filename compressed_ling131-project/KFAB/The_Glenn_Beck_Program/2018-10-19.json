[noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing for the New York times today and it is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage\nEver ever um he did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said\nYes that are part of this saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something that against motives will write like he would ask they say yes\nOr or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone\nAnd while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure and himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics covered on our absolutely yeah the power to make you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian\nHe's in ... he wields incredible how right in this country now like credit let her have her fired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation that they're kind of comical why and what they were saying they're saying that ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there or something invited her back to his trailer to do its thing in front of her which apparently was says\nThis is ... ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nThat's the center the allegation they didn't he didn't do it in force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation she asked her to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right\nYeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I I have issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault the accusation there are no matter what show which she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right man he admitted in such a general way that people kind of uh making people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think that\nThe one I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is\nNo and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible\nBut that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scare away from right you're not supposed to just as the other people will commit crimes in the future\nSo he's not listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of that probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks into doesn't set or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose hey well I'm In a doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he espoused raunchy several clubs around New York since and they let them under the age so the New York times there's an exhaustive report about tried to talk to the club owner about why you let him onstage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision listen\nAll the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like never mhm might never he says never\nSaid well could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder\nAs the owner of a place where you would say particularly to a female customer who is somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton who is credibly obviously accused in Juanita broader I mean I think nobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere\nNobody\nLike why were they sharing Roman Polanski as they were the years why were they giving standing ovation whether they were after accused of sexually abusing the accused ... he did it but behind all these people you're mentioning Roman Polanski the film director Bill Clinton the president Lewis became a comedian\nIs someone who gives them a stage and in this case that's you rub on had nobody cares that Mike Tyson who rapes are convicted of raping somebody performs can only control the venue you control\nYes but but it's not unusual to\nExpect some consistent wow and you see wildly inconsistent demands if it's so obvious that the guy who Nasser ... in front of women and expose itself and women should never work again\nYeah I I ... I mean that's amazing mea irrationality of\nOkay but you let this guy on who did much less than they are and you shouldn't you shouldn't have let this comedian perform on your stage fright and the fact that nobody cares about these other people the same people right by the way\nWho want him to shut out Louis CK didn't care about Clinton didn't care about any of these other circumstances but he's supposed to yeah and it\nYou know I I Will say he he was really smart about this I mean he he well he some great points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was just constantly trying to say well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed and try out it personally on him as to why he made the decision which is an interesting part of the story but I mean he made the point is well\nOf look what is the line\nWe don't allow him ... to work so what does that mean does he go on the governmental\nOr can you work at other jobs can you work ... what if Louis the cake hired by Walmart would that be okay\nRemodeling new furniture you ... your own half and half habitat hills more homes brief story twenty find him I've been wanting to own a hundred and recycling reusing habitat refund or twenty having your half African\nCooler weather means more time span inside and here come the holidays ... zeroes carpet care make your homes Marco with beautifully clean fresh carpet with a zero ... patent that empowered water treatment\nSorrows doesn't use any so therefore no soapy residue left behind after those ... your carpet as clean fresh fantasize beautiful set was pregnant some air\nAnd remember that there's been a lot going on in the spring\nThe summer the fall and maybe it has been a while since you've had a good professional carpet cleaning right now from zero or as you can get three rooms pre treated ... starting for just one hundred twenty nine dollars\nAll uprising details available when you call for that appointment for oh to nine three three Nineteen eighty eight or you can book on line to zero arouse any dot com survey ... yeah like a metros and surrounding areas zero spell at the same forwards and backwards zeroes carpet care\nAnd I can't believe how could you know I I mean I don't know why\nAm I trying to you and I'm like\nAlong with your best friend to extreme now more than just the doggie daycare every now and is that how into happy ... with rooming boarding an exercise in your body will be only are they went from ...\n... and after each for find more detail that he hound dot com [noise]\nWhat many tonight burgers Santos pizza [laughter] All right fine for me to go for a long time [noise] when was that you\nWere me right along with your best friend to downtown out more than just a doggie daycare downtown hounded the palace of had the ... with grooming boarding an exercise and your body will be all the years to and from downtown\nThe heat in Leavenworth or find more details and found dot com\nDot com bust that ... that's in first place in residential ruby seven years in around Baltimore to live on the Ninety three hundred today young that\nI Can't think of anything I mean you sound much like taking to the doctor when I broke my flight leading me alone when I Want it to be alone and now as a grown up I'm thankful\nFor being able to take care of you might hear mom for taking idiot therapies for understanding from time to be alone rules change without us noticing that is why AARP gives you the information to provide even better care for your loved one in eight or ... dot org slash caregiving brought to you by a rpm the outcomes\nReady for a computer showed that actually gives you useful information then you'll love this with or shark from shark innovations Sunday Morning at seven dollars news radio a lot of men tell ya baby\nAnd\nThe patent for Glenn today AAA seven to seven the ISI K are we going to show you\nKnow just how loving and inclusive and diverse the left is will will share another really good example of that how they love everybody you\nKnow and they're just they're so kind and loving accepting intolerance that's the beauty of tolerant of that word by the way I Am not a thing anymore you're totally tolerate anything you know more\nYou don't believe exactly what they want you to believe there's no tolerate a lot of people on the left who have who dealt with with that and that they've yeah Ninety percent of the stuff but you you fall down on one issue to the progressive\nGod look outlook out yeah\nGive me some examples coming up on the globe\nNews radio eleven ten K.

been an activist is march women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in ... motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Am I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that this uh this has occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicates that you know the event occurred I Would ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they leave I ever they survived\nThis assault by this man\nIf they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive and [laughter] you know I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically\nSurvived everything that's happened to us so life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible uh a ... a million things are possible you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up why would she lie about it that's a good question\nBecause I Love this one mhm possibly could lawyer motivation [laughter]\nNot whether or not you should like this I don't know

children's lives about as strongly as they ... they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to\nHow many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy\nWho you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week were five five accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why people are are of all many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time\nAnd the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you can like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacy is\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know for a fact\nThe fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them\nWe know the the fourth accuser didn't even bother to write any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two\nAnd in the second one is the is that there's a ... their right they wouldn't be the person who made the allegation said I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that\nPerson said no it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly is the act I don't even know her operating what evidence on that one either and there was and look the Ford won was only I think taken more seriously than the others because there was it an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if they're just with no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people like have it on his ah his or what this is worth saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went and just you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible job it recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a\nCredible accusation against someone but it's completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you could do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this\nLike a ... the media access if it's an entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter] I Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd ... you brought up the high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accuses one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk I don't like to look at him I just don't like him\nThat's why they accused him the credits didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who uh got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her elegy peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a ... you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive

be down at Lincoln also a great place to go after the husky game and watch all the other college football in NFL action there on Sunday that's Tanner sports bar and grill and build Omaha here in Lincoln\nOr you just heard Scott Ross and Mario reduced go a Robin ... talking about the waiver that they got for a no federal and this was an interesting deal because it took so long and the\nTurn of events was crazy they get an email on friday when they landed in Chicago about four thirty central time the last flight\nThat leaves Lincoln to Chicago it is at six o'clock so in that little period they had to basically tell them that massacre were booking won the commercial flight and you're going home and then know of ... got on that flight to know a veteran was on that last Lincoln flight that landed in Chicago and the ... massacre had to get on that flight and go back to Lincoln\nAnd you feel a little bit from massacre I Believe his parents I Know we're driving on their way into Chicago\nUm but that's got to the big business college football there's this is going to be moments like this that are are fair um you know you're trying to win games in ... their most veterans sideline presence at the quarterback position in terms of knowing the system but now the question is\nWhat can you really do this year why did it take so long first of all I talked to 'em than the cult compliance director Jayme bought about that he said this was not a deal where we were\nYou know sitting on paperwork and screw something up it was a highly complex case I cannot get into what what why it took this long uh but he said I'm the NC double a really reviewed this thing so there had to be another thing Nader Robin I'm whether it was a family issue or some sort of special waiver Nate that was delaying this that they really were looking at\nYeah they're well there had to be some sort of precedents that somewhere else and it's similar case\nWhere they were kind of comparing trying to compare apples to apples here\nI'm ... and I don't know the whole thing is really confusing because I remember when we first talked with no uh back in early August he made it sound like the coaches told him that it was it was over and done with that there was no chance that it wasn't happening that he'd gotten word that that the waiver was not going to happen and then all of a sudden they drew Martinez goes down\nAnd and they they there's a word that they're trying to push things through all of a sudden and so I mean the whole thing is really strange but yeah there there had to be some ... some sort of family deal or some sort of precedent where they they found that the incident boy had cleared a similar case in the past and they tried to use that as to why\nHe deserved to be a clear and uh the season\nYou know going back to poor mask or you know I'd invasion at the end like it in the bachelor when they like photo guy off and he doesn't get a rose by the time say your goodbyes and gather you're thanks [laughter] I I\nLook at it as more as an um hard knocks Matt rabbit in my office replay bring your play with the coach wants to see but anyway yeah obviously there was probably a lot of unsaid elements involved with that and you know you gotta think\nProfit it wasn't NC double a issue so if it wasn't a brass issue wasn't NC double a issue that only leads one or two maybe other parties involved that could have held\nThing up um you know speculate from there but uh I don't know if ... going to make the immediate impact people's thoughts I mean he adds adapt he's another quarterback body they trust but like you know Virginia was saying\nI'm On Wednesday that he just hasn't gotten much reps with the first team at all he didn't do or this is like it's a yeah or the second time he's basically scout team guy all spring and that's why he struggled not spring game and then you know he was basically like you said needed they would kind of wrote him off as\nA one gonna play this year and so he didn't work with those you know top three or four guys all off season\nUh and so now to expect him to be fully ready to take over the office of the job the hat\nI just don't know if he's ready there so I think Andrew bunches still you're going to your number two um if it comes to that um but at least now your emergency situation you feel a whole lot better about that and as the season goes along you know and he gets more wraps under his belt maybe he takes the rain and that number\nTwo I thought it was interesting that the coaching staff kind of took blame for that spring game because no federal did not look good in the spring guinea struggled a lot and British because that's on us he wasn't really wrapped at all and we just threw him out there and\nThat was why he struggled because you'll back and watch them eat looks pretty good at UCF the year before you and you know it seemed like you just walk in there and make it look easy and it's not that easy you need repetitions\nYeah it's it's you you can't just come off off the bench cold and after a ... you know after sitting in a while and and not having any wraps and and go out there in in ... and performed to a level that um you know the that they expect or that they want\nA good thing is though I think this is more of a case of knocking the rust off in terms of uh instead of you know learning you know like like for us it in the open he knows more about those off than anybody on campus outside of the coaching staff and so\nI I don't think that learning curve is going to be all the big for him it's just more about just kind of knocking the rust off and getting back into the the swing of\nThings in the meantime having him on the sideline or to be able to help signal in plays and essentially having another quarterbacks coach on the sideline for Adrian Martinez that's value in itself I mean to have him there at Northwestern\nI'm to be able to have another voice along with Mario reduced go on and that's that's a valuable for a young freshman quarterback to just have two guys that nobody often is better than anyone on coaching you as the game goes from the sidelines especially on the road\nBecause no no was highly intelligent kid I mean like a four point oh various students students so yeah his his presence will will meet a lot here especially in some of these road trips I Want to hit on the vine of the guys here as we continue up into the discussion great about the number one running back in the country by pro football focus with his performance last week at Northwestern\nThere was a point there late in the fourth quarter he wasn't in\nAnd you wonder I Know they were trying to keep guys fresh for man when you got the guy that's the hottest back right now in the country according to the pro grades they got released afterwards um you wonder if they regret taken him out for that one series and and I know we got in there for the final final one they weren't able to get the first down on but um you know he is really having a little run here the last few weeks\nTo Prescott needs to hitch that wagon to divine as it goes back and rewrite it until he can no longer pole and I mean he is that type of player right now he is playing\nBy far the best football of his career and you could say he is the best player in Nebraska has right now with the way he was ... film into a yeah I mean is it it's debatable but I mean defined as they build his rush for what over three hundred yards and two games I mean taking away the\nFive carry day at Madison to Madison game where they just didn't run the football uh so you know I mean he he is playing the best football career I made a joke on Twitter during the game that he's running like Earl Campbell and I'm only kind of joking about that he was running with just\nAnger and not only that in his physical self he was making people missed that the next level about ... percent of its yards came out of context just breaking tackles I mean that's kind of the one knock on him yes he was able to move the pile for for yards\nBut he was never able to make that cuts and break a tackle and get to the open field and\nUm that dynamic to his game kinda backs up with the staff had been saying for so long about how he's the strongest and fastest and lean Estes ever been it showing right now and so with it you know young quarterback because you don't want to put too much pressure on I say right as a ball all day until you know he finally needed a break\nYou know I think you you got to feed the beast right now I mean he's on a roll\nA Greg Austin said following Wednesday's practice that ah the light has really come on for him over the past couple of weeks because he's fully comfortable in this off and see these finally\nGonna knows the ins and outs and and he's not necessarily thinking about things it's just it's just coming natural to him and um you know on the telecast ... the the uh the announcers kept saying that that Troy Walters and they're and they're a pre game meetings and said that\nThe divine not gonna make too many people miss but you know he's a strong physical runner well he was making people miss I mean he was showing that one touchdown run yeah I mean that was amazing so he is he is definitely a he is the hot hand right now and and I think you gotta keep feeding him going forward\nWhen we come back we're going to shift our discussion over to the defense how does Nebraska rebound after because it's such a tough close to that game at Northwestern we'll discuss that

Martinez\nHas the clear edge I mean he's put a blueprint on the field this year that other Big Ten schools at this point are saying while we do not want to see this guy for the next three or four years um and I just don't know if they have any other quarterbacks on the team that could say that so I Would say right now I Would Adrian Martinez has a clear clear edge on that job for next year\nThere is zero chance he takes the starting job from Adrian Martinez but what his presence could do is change out on a brass uses Adrian Martinez no longer will they be sitting there worried about is Adrian goes down we have this massive drop off to\nA walk on you know that is basically going to change the complexity of are often they have a guy that knows the often is better than anyone on the entire team or that you can fall back on who actually has experienced playing in a game in the system so I think that may be the biggest impacts know eventual has as far as games next season\nYou know that's totally the game changer right there is is how\nAre you can kind of take the training wheels off of a a a dream Martinez right now because you know you got a guy like bedroom back they're backing him up by ... said as much Adrian Martinez is is our guy he's he's the guy\nThat we're going to lead us in the future and these are future quarterback and so uh you know ... when the head man is talking like that I don't I don't see there being any reason why you would think federal is going to be able to to knock him off\nHow badly does Nebraska want to dominate Minnesota after they rounded up last year and water to brass 'cause major keys to victory\nSee I'm One of those ones that don't look at that game last year as Minnesota running it up I look at it as more Nebraska wasn't prepared and there was a team that gave up on the coaching staff and the game plan that ... had in place they were defensively not prepared\nAnd tenor leave then left that game suddenly at halftime and put them in a precarious situation where they didn't know generally all of a sudden you win the locker room at halftime and they're like oh my God ... doesn't even know where he's at right now he had a concussion that he suffered in that game\nWhen they pull them so I don't think PJ Fleck tried to run that I've I really don't I think it was more Nebraska was not prepared and they just got their butts kicked\nNow in Minnesota and run it up in a rascal laid down and that was that was the disaster from the very get go uh were Nebraska didn't want to be there they didn't want to play the football game they just wanted to get out of there and\nThat over the kickoff you went back for a touchdown or as a ... ...\nThey started right out of the gates in Nebraska we just dont refer right then and there and so if you consider running the score up just running the ball the middle and none of your defenders even trying to tackle the ball carrier sure Minnesota random score\nThe quarterback that killed Nebraska that day she Jay Iraq ran him out of town at the end of the Arab but not\nVery next week I think he had one of the worst game to the season so I mean that that had nothing to do with Minnesota it had everything to do with Nebraska\nYeah it's not like BJ flick was was throwing the ball over all over the yard and trying to\nTurn Iraq a points if you can't stop a play then I I think every coach in America it would be crazy to not run up that play until you foresee other team to stop it and in Nebraska just ... they could not or they would not stop it same difference\nWe're taking your questions here in the mail bag with house Caroline intern alec Rome\nWhy hasn't the special teams put coal from into kick field goals yet\nWell you know that guy on the driving range and driving a mile\nBut then when you take them with the course and the accuracy is not there on the actual golf course that's coal from he can kick the ball a mile he just doesn't have the consistency and the accuracy and that's what I've heard from multiple people you watch warm ups he's got a stronger leg ah but the consistency is just not there\nYeah and I guess there's probably not turn them just completely bail on a true freshmen\nUm who was on a scholarship for a reason I mean he was one of the better ... when he came here\nBut clearly there's something going on between the years with Barrett Pickering right now I don't know what it is a but there is an issue right now to where it's kind of changing\nThe way Scott Frost manages games if you know they had more trust in ... Pickering I'll bet you they can feel will and that the overtime situation or the fact that he had missed a short feel will and an extra point earlier in that game um\nHe wanted to keep the ball and they often says hand and so I mean that's going to be interesting how they managed games going forward if they go for more often when they're inside their own Ford or even on inside their own thirty just because they don't have that faith and they're kicking game right now\nOf of this entire class at this point in time of six one hundred and eighty pounds or so and he can flat out fly I mean he is he's the definition of a game breaker or ... with his speed he he can really\nUh change change the game in a heartbeat and and uh and I think that's exactly what Nebraska wants they need play makers to because\nAfter you lose a Stanley Morgan this year you know ... is is having a good year but you you need some more play makers on that off and so and I think Jamie Nance can definitely do that and maybe more than anything he's got the opportunity to come in and be a dynamic punt return or and kick return or right off the bat to\nA he has a return I think for total kicks to kick off to punt returns\nI'm In and you're right he did not have the biggest game um the other night but he impacted that game you know he doesn't need to necessarily stuff the stat sheet to have a huge impact and in really on the special teams\nThe the the opposition was so afraid to punt to him that they were ... Fifteen yards out of bounds and so are his office had great field position all night long a and he's a great kid to you know as soon as we showed up\nAh people for everyone from from parents in the booster clubs to\nThe band director to photographers and local newspaper guys were saying oh man\nJamie Nance has a great kid you guys are going to love this kid he's\nHe's this sees that and I mean that's what you want to hear and that's exactly what you want to hear just random strangers that have it's not like the coach tell them you're always a great kid well yeah most coaches are going to say that about their player but when you got some random you know a newspaper will not a dog in the fight doesn't care who's wearing an Oklahoma sooner is hat\nTelling you how great and wonderful this kid is and how how special of a a a player and a kid that Nebraska is getting it resonates a little bit\nAnd they Nebraska doesn't have a by week anymore and this has been kind of the territory of the year after this weekend's game that they would have been able to get out for them cook and um do you have any idea like what their game plan is going to be if they're going to try to slip out\nNext week at all or will they have regular practice week with doing cook men are because you know it it is the one real negative but not having to buy a week is you're not able to get out and make a week of you know valuations\nYeah I I you know I don't know what the exact plan is going to be but we saw right before they they play Wisconsin we saw a handful of coaches making some visits a game it's real easy to do\nAnd it's really easy to do um but I I Would anticipate you know maybe one or two coaches getting out during the week next week leading up to the bathroom cook mean game\nUm you know Ryan Held in particular I I think that he could be a guide to to go out and and hit up a couple of junior college um were you know programs whether it be Kansas or or out in California Arizona Mississippi whatever um I think that's very very likely", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Omaha", "day": "19"}
