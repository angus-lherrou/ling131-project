of people who feel that they haven't been listening to and they had been screwed by people in Washington and lied to by people in Washington\nAnd the media I could give you a million examples or let's

thing that goes out every night and he is wherever he supposed to be the check on the press\nSort of this\nThe key message in President Trump's mid term playbook hate the media fear the migrants caravan save me from a democratic oversight\nHe's trying to stay on message despite the Pittsburgh massacre and the fallout from the wave of mail bombs that means he's bashing the fake news while newsrooms or on a heightened state of security alert\nDidn't seem to care about that with me when they were attacking me and my family was under attack\nThat means he's talking about a migrant invasion at the southern border while authorities examined the Pittsburgh shooters hatred of invaders and Jews he's scheduled to travel to Pittsburgh on Tuesday even though the mayor has urged him to postpone is visit\nIt's likely to be a very big story on Tuesday\nThere was a White House scolding\nSarah Sanders surprised the press corps by scheduling of rare White House briefing on Monday at the briefing Sanders claimed that CNN rushed to blame the president for the pipe bombs\nSee at our at CNN PR responded no press secretary CNN did not say the real Donald Trump was directly responsible for the bombs send to our office by his are again to embolden supporter\nWe did say that he and you should understand that your words matter every single one of them\nBut so far you don't seem to get that Bloomberg\nTrump is inciting people the president should be unifying and instead he's exciting people end inciting people said Michael Bloomberg to CNN and exclusive interview on\nMonday on October twenty first the Pittsburgh suspects rode on gab I have noticed a change and people saying illegals they're now saying invaders I like this\nIs social media footprint showed how hatred of Jews\nWith the hatred of immigrant invaders who he may never know where he heard this hateful language button right wing TV and radio has been saturated with invasion and invaders talk for the last\nTwo weeks websites and social media feeds have been spreading conspiracy theories about Jews helping the caravan\nSo I Do hope there's some soul searching even belatedly about this the humanizing content in coverage first\nKey point Fox hosts Fox gas GOP leaders they're all talking about an imminent invasion even though no such thing is happening\nOn Fox I counted more than six the invasion invasion references since October sixteenth invading was brought up more than a dozen times on Fox Business I counted more than Seventy five invasion references mostly on Lou Dobbs show\nBy the way this data includes repeats but now Trump is using the word\nThe president apparently isn't second guessing himself on Monday he used the word invasion for the first\nTime in a tweet but many Americans perhaps most\nAre looking at Trump's decision to send fifty two hundred troops to the border as a stunt more political theater on MSNBC is all in Michelle Goldberg she said quote Trump is not only created this big lie about this caravan that has inspired mass murder\nBut he's now shifting the resources of government to substantiate his lie\nAt the same time on Fox Tucker Carlson review arrests reassured his views are viewers that migrating caravan is a real thing but what do you do with the invaders\nOliver Darcy emails I think the natural question to ask is what do you do with invaders this rhetoric from Fox is particularly charge because of what it tells the Fox audience one\nDoesn't lead invaders into their home when faced with the invaders one generally use is everything at their disposal to confront them including force and that's the message that Fox is relaying to millions of people and quote\nShip speaks the proof\nQuote there is no invasion no one is coming to get you ship Smith said on Monday there is nothing at all to worry about the caravan is only talk about the myth terms\nBrought to you by Omaha largest men's testosterone clinic limitless male medical has

number for\nGood grief is the newest Halloween episode of ABC's Modern Family they take a certain place this week the number two it's the everyday angel episode of Grey's Anatomy\nAnd finally Halloween the than it wouldn't be complete without some TV scares American horror story apocalypse remains as their number one TV stream\nThat's actually stop TV streamed on our radio\nTo protect his family from disaster do you do\nCamera phone done\nBy taking pictures that it's important documents you can always go to Stuart online more simple disaster prep defeated ready to go a message for the money I'd go\nWhen asking your smart speaker for Nebraska news weather and traffic makes sure he'd say please and say play K. F. A. B. on I heart radio [noise]\nIt's a client that probably am let me remind you who we are [noise]\nAs hurricane Michael neared landfall in Panama City and Mexico beach in Florida\nThe media kicked into high gear as usual the reporters were positioned in areas where the wind would be you know the strongest wonder about blowing away don't go outside all that stuff the animated countdown clocks began to pop up in the lower right to fill all the cable news broadcasts\nAnd the great questions which now served as headlines in lieu of actual reported facts began to surface in the lower thirds of all of our TV screens hurricane Michael the global warming super charge the storm\nOr is a rally the best use of Trump's time during a hurricane horror but politics over hurricane Michael when politicians take it too far\nIt's nothing new this is what happens is natural disasters\nIt's a cheap and easy way to score political points you know grab ratings sell newspapers get radio broadcast to being listened to whatever especially during election seasons but this time this time I had a unique insight into this storm\nOne of the producers on my TV show approached me and said I've got to go to Michael's ground zero\nAnd I said well why are you volunteer and he said no that's where my parents live small town Mexico beach that's where we're at all seeing there was nothing left at the time he said this details were scarce\nBut things were looking you know like it was going to get really bad I said just go take care of your family if you needed and call me a mercury one is already they're providing workers aid in the area so whatever you need just let me know\nSo he left he disappeared for about a week under the radar and she came back\nAnd I said how are your parents how what's the situation what does it feel like\nHe said glad I've never seen devastation like this before in person I've never the majority of the town was just wiped out\nHe said it was so weird driving up to the town that I I go to all the time I visit every year and it's not there it's just an endless field of debris\nFamily home was still standing but it needed to be demolished and bulldozed and they were joined in that regard by many of the friends and neighbors in the town he told me about the storm surge that had swelled to fourteen feet clearing the coastline homes of belongings\nLeaving strands of seaweed across the second floor ceilings\nThe smell of mold and early ... permeating the air unless you've been in a hurricane you don't know that smell but once you smelled it you've never smelling like it people shoveling broken wood in shingles out of the way in hopes of finding anything that they owned intact\nOverturned tractor trailers fishing boats that had been hurled through walls and windows it was a beach side paradise apocalypse\n\nI asked him I said so how are people doing how are they holding up are they losing faith I mean they've lost everything he looked at me and he said Glenn it is exactly the opposite he said everybody I talked to last week none of them were talking about the blaring headlines\nHe said nobody was talking about climate change boss or you know a policy um you know what they were questioning as does my neighbor have enough water\nDo you have do you need something come do you need help do you have enough food to last through the day\n\nInstead of writing nasty editorials about the lack of government assistance and FEMA's incompetence\nFolks were just doing what Americans do they were helping each other ... over the gaping holes in their rooms at one point President Trump arrived marine one soaring low over the town flanked by futuristic looking a spray or aircraft\nOne very liberal leaning family member\nLooked up and said wow isn't that something\nAnd then immediately looked back down looking for anything that they could salvaged from the wreckage of their life\nThere wasn't any time there wasn't any need to sit back and rail on the controversial president so presidential entrance\nAnd doing a symphony rocks show all in the same seven days and that I think is is the gift that a single truck and bring to a community the numbers are quite staggering actually so when you think\nAbout the um Hudson's bay and it's like over a hundred and twenty thousand people every year and of course the number of those folks are in our concert hall but I Would say over thirty percent or not and we've got twenty five thousand of our area students to participate in education programs all the way from a mission imagination program is the\nFirst introduction to our pre school and early elementary kids to\nA partnership with ... hall in New York um which allows kids to study music with recorders member recording yeah fluke I yeah\nI

Fox News President Trump in Florida this hour the first stop on the campaign blitz and the final days before the midterm\nThere's a few people that have really truly\nLost it\nAnd they're not even listening to themselves anymore\nIt's amazing\nFirst of all one of the most contradictory things I've ever heard let me quote again so we have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men Don you're demonizing white man\nHe went from zero stop demonizing basically don't be racist to one hundred white men are scary we need a white man ban\nMost demonizing racist thing I've heard\n[laughter]\nCan I ask you what is the definition of racism to what is the definition it isn't it isn't it saying\nAll people are have this trait if they're part of this race\nYeah a discrimination and antagonism prejudice directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own racist superior belief that all members of each race because that's characteristics or ability specific to that race especially as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race so that\nWould be it white men are the problem is I I I never said that about Islam\nAll of the people who are Muslim or the problem it would be wrong to say that white men are the problem we're also eager to assign blame how many of us were\nRapidly refreshing social media hoping like hell but the full pipe bomber was someone from the left\nWhy why\n[noise]\nEveryone on the left was doing the same thing except in reverse we're doing it because we want someone to point to and say get 'em we want somebody to blame see it's them\nWe're not addressing the actual issues here white men are the problem\nReally\nI you know I Am so sick and tired of hearing what we did in the Eighteen hundreds Juno the trail of tears yes I Know the trail of tears it was awful you know who\nDid it a Democratic president Jackson aid is ... ... human being\nHe took our founding principles and turn them upside down\nThat's not an American thing to do that's all you talk about well I got it I got it how about we talk about uh the Japanese and unit seven thirty one worse\nWorse than the Nazis now that's saying something worse than the Nazis they went in and they said the only problem\nWith Mongolia's all these Mongols tried to kill them all\nThey just stormed into China where it was a white man they're speaking of China how 'bout mouth fifty million dad was he led by a white man\nKorea concentration camps where's the white guy\nRwanda Rwanda where's the white guy there\nYou see John it is not a race problem it is a human problem\nBut nobody really wants to talk about that because nobody's really looking for an answer\nGod God Almighty can we decide if we want to save this or not do you want to say that\nOne wants to discuss mental health no one wants to discuss addiction to ...\nUBS loneliness this connection from community the decline of religion the list goes on and on and on it's all about yes but which party did you vote for\nIt's easy to see why you hear ... you know when you hear people like Don Lemon spiel this and this is Don hate spiel this hate that CNN actually has the call to call objective reporting\n\nAnd to the over one hundred million white men out there\nEither forget switching Geico\nYou've just save tons of money by never having to buy a Halloween costume ever again because your the biggest terrorist threats in the country just show up in your Gulf pants oh oh 'cause I Know what you want to do with that golf clap your trust one of the people to death in the room\nWhen ... first [noise] your lessening the Klan that program\nRead a great Washington Post editorial\nAfter deranged Democrat living in his van nearly assassinated rubber Republican Steve ...\nFiring more than Seventy rounds that House Republicans practicing for the congressional baseball game house minority leader Nancy Pelosi declared it outrageous that anyone would blame democratic rhetoric for inspiring the shooter quote how dare they say such a thing below sea thundered\nNever mind that the shooter echoed democratic victory all against the president ranting on Facebook that Trump is guilty and go to ... you should go to prison for treason and that quote Democrat or Trump has destroyed our democracy it's time to destroy Trump and company\nNow Democrats are doing exactly what they condemned\nMan it is so easy doesn't feel good students get up in the morning and know that I don't have to answer for my positions in the past because I've been consistent I didn't blame the Democrats for that shooting I'm not blaming Donald Trump for this yeah feels good sales really good\nDemocrats are doing exactly what they condemned blaming President Trump's divisive rhetoric for the recent spat of a mail bomb attacks and the massacre at Pittsburgh synagogue\nThe truth is they ceded the moral high ground ... years ago our descent individually all began long before Trump and Democrats and their allies are as culpable as the president\nNotice he even said this there\nCulpable he didn't say very responsible it's their fault\nFinally somebody with reason is saying yeah both sides\nRecall it in two thousand they N. double ACP spent millions on ugly ads a clue accusing George W. Bush of moral equivalence with white supremacist who brutally Lynch James Byrd in Nineteen Ninety eight\nQuote my father was beaten chained then dragged three miles to his death all because he was black said burns daughter as a screen flash grainy images of a chain dragging the body behind a pickup truck so when governor George W. Bush refused to support hate crime legislation it was like my father was killed all over again\nWas that the Republicans doing that argued demonizing\nIf you look up demonizing I just want to make sure it's it's a signing a of a characteristics of the devil\nNo\n\nBrock Obama set the tone for his two thousand eight campaign against John McCain when he declared if they bring a knife to the fight we bring a gun\nJohn Lewis Democrat from Georgia answered that call when he ... when he compared to McCain to the segregation is a Alabama George while Alabama's governor George Wallace and declared McCain was replicating the climate of hatred and division John Frick in McCain\n\nThat led to the attacks on civil rights workers for years later a pro Obama superPAC ran ads showing GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan pushing an old lady in a wheelchair over the side of a cliff while another ran a fall sad blaming Mitt Romney for a woman's death from cancer\nCan we just all agree on this because I was not a supporter of of Mitt Romney [noise] his policies are all screwed up however Mitt Romney is a good guy he's a nice guy he's not a he's\nHow do you demonize Mitt Romney they did and when the when the left was honest for about five minutes after they got beaten by ... by Donald Trump I heard one of them say you know what we kind of brought this on ourselves because we rejected and demonize people like Mitt Romney\nYes yes\nYou're exactly right [noise]\nDuring the twenty sixteen campaign Hillary Clinton compared Republicans to Nazis saying regard illegal immigrants they want it to round them up and put them into box cars\nSo let's see let's see let's see demonizing we gotta stop with this rhetoric\nPutting them into box cars or you're saying that Donald Trump is going to round people up and put them into camps like Auschwitz she compared the geo Pete terrorist just what Don limited today are\nReally really good and when you're ready to do something important\nFor the investment you made in your house like fix or put on a new roof let us do the job on line minute roofing dot net\nIt's luxury new or reliable pre owned or at least deal car truck van SUV you're going
