morning or maybe I can give you an some of the long time listeners some advice\nOkay I'm not really well\n[laughter] I like I've been a subscriber to this network as it was a TV we hearing voice when you're struggling a bit more than ... than usual okay yeah my my my advice is make it tangible because there's so many of us that tune in every day and and listening to this broadcast but then we don't make a tangible\nAnd even you were saying that you haven't been doing it shows you haven't been out of the road for a while I think it's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people yes I agree my friend and I\nTruly a I have a a friend of mine that's a Vietnam veteran in his seventies and we went all the way we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at two AM drove six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday\nAnd and then stood for eleven hours straight because we we were told the first two thousand people in line would get into the hangar and we knew we were going to get that way and and as it got through security and looking at George saying oh I Can't wait to sit down and you get to the hangar there were no states so there's the reality of we're going to be standing another six hours\nOn concrete so ... is this president is a lawyer I'm Sorry I just play just playing the Brazilian go ahead so I could say\nIt as much as they want you know what we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale a solidarity network which was a socialist group that was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake breakfast before they came to protest and you know we we were joking well do you think there were beginning gluten free options to go along with that and right but\nThere were over ten thousand people there for the rally unless they Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of heard you say this about your ... functions when you've had the restoring functions there was no garbage we you would never know when I was ten thousand people there no one was complaining\nI was kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I wasn't going to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down no people were so open about talking and\nYou know someone had to go to the bathroom and into their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child while while you may run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment and you know it's like a president does have a show I\nWas I and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois\nBecause I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt whether the president was going to show up or not\nAnd this is after we got in the hunger we'd been standing there for two hours but we never gave up hope and we were we we all know we had jokes of conservatives the one thing liberals can do better than us is chance we can't chance it's like when he classes or something\nI Know we saw it and I'm really glad we [laughter]\nYou know it's it was such a positive environment and our legs were or just killing us by the time today\nThere and George not drove back that night it was at twenty eight our road trip that we ... for this experience and as exhausted as we were in as much as we were a gang George looks at me and says he doesn't want to know very later this week as an how far is that\nWell that was that what it was just six hours Missouri and it's going to be eight but we were going to\nGo and get we found out that this one was going to happen right across the river on friday so like at Cannes up all the best I can say is go and meet the other people tend to Seventy five\n... and ... were very quiet people say wait you you've got to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realize like at least there's hope for society yeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot\nYou know like well yeah I'm help Alison\nHang on to the second I Want to get you to copy of my book I I signed it I'll send it out to you thank you so much for holding and thanks for I'm I'm sharing that it is that that is but maybe if I don't I struggling today\nDo feel like some struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to them I'm a little frustrated that are happening in the nation I Would say at the end of April I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what she's saying here um let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nI'm being an anti Semite chief his daughter is Jewish\nThe ... you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively few yeah how many how many Nazis were like oh you know what yeah okay so my daughter's gonna marry this Jewish guy she's going to become Jewish that's great that doesn't happen again\nWhen you're talking about uh American Jews one of the main things they've asked the president for for how many generations was to move the capital hacked to Jerusalem\nAnd if the guy that did it I mean he you know look it's insane\nIt boils down to these ridiculous uh summaries\nOf what a person believes they are you telling me you can't criticize someone on the on the left that you disagree with politically because they're Jewish because then you get called an anti Semite\nThe same way like a liberal should be able to criticize without fear of being called a racist Clarence Thomas it should be able to say I think he's wrong on the on the constitution they should absolutely be able to do that without being called racist\nBut this this bizarre thing and this is carried out today not by you know a\nMother Jones in the Huffington Post read expected but every mainstream media source asking question after question after question what part of this give me a percentage tell me please how much of this is Donald Trump's fault so here's let me let me\nDo what the Allison just said let's make a tangible here is Joe Lieberman on a very frustrating interview with CNN listen to this\nWell it's a shocking moment I mean I we view it all through our own experience I I have had a life as a Jewish American which has been is not only free of anti Semitism\nBut I've had this opportunity to be elected senator from a state Connecticut where the Jewish population as well to present and then a gorgeous me the chance to run for vice president for his Jewish American on a national ticket\nA really an ... I face no anti Semitism\nA and forgive me from going back to the end of the two thousand election we actually got five hundred thousand more votes and the other ticket ... was she was a reflection and numbers of people were voting are based on religion so when something like this happens\nA public service announcements brought to you by the council\nHi I'm ...

your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is a military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country this has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected and a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing\nThat men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether

happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get all the with the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and\nThe sort of toss up category you have a big at the polling has been close and now we start to try and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races uh we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana the polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz is still lean Republican state\nA ... and a ... a Mississippi and North Dakota are going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tossed up still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved to Tennessee back into their uh Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points plays falling has a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the top ... category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race because you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one as a lean democratic state um we moved from Minnesota as well from faith Democrat to leaning Democrat but\nPolling there [noise] you know I still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer than I think most people expect there's two reasons in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we moved to lean Democrat as well or with the tops of race for most of the time it looks like tester has not enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point er and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's I don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a loaded it started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we see no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big ... pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe mansion I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kevin Olival yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hike camp I think she's done um but as of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThe majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keeping those in the tops of categories of or a week away we gotta pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now or it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back we're going to give us some of

leisure ... welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem well problem it's an executive order I'd agree with them [laughter]\nSo you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] it was not the justification yeah that is the justification\nI think what would happen is it would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally okay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the ... amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a ...\nIt's just to reiterate or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to carry that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is\nOh Gees okay and they get I'll stop it yeah you're gee you literally Democrats knock it off mhm yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know as sneaking in cross that having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here ludicrous that what that was\n... and so it's what I took her to know all this time\nRight but you can't you can't you should do it with an executive no but if he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court and kind of okay with it\nYeah and that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because of they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just because I\nConstitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually\nMeans it seems to be a disagreement among even original is what the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be internally there is yeah I think it'd be interesting to see how that shakes out because you know one of the things we praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs to the judges he's put in\nWould now rule on that than with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was gonna be fascinating that it does happen imagine\nChuck Schumer and uh and Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh\nWe we really believe that is that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh really I mean\nYou can usually come with a Pittsburgh shooter and if you say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's gotta be a part of it that just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership tried to ban that\nPittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play can we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise] you know in a week [noise]\nPeople get to make a decision is is the America they want to live in\nBecause right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a porn behavior I and I really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about baseball we're talking about as bad hair day there that was done intentionally [laughter] send a message\nTo white nationalist says about me that much but I'm going to launch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nI'm just not that I'm I'm not gonna let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become so twisted they well and that's from a\nAnd he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah\nIt doesn't it yeah right yeah not again it's just a matter of timing I'm All right so\nHere's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this game changing stuff and between a bitcoin crypto currency and block chain\nThat is the future and you need to understand it take this Glenn Beck exclusive course right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven P.
