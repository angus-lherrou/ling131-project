[noise]\nNow the news radio eleven and a B whether watch\n[noise]\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep\nAll of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split it's going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before\nUm when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other over the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to happen\n... it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of ... oh yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh sing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this up two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up are and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabin I'll thing now I mean I think it's real I ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence and two thousand six and two thousand ten we're at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest than partisans because partisans engage more like generally I'm the type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kevin I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with them and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone in sane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever the entire life like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so\nI mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and more\nOf this one's could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are disgusted with what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this out of here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\nWhat which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this Huh Interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... come Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um a Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently uh what was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two thousand each each one Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters wow a and again that was a wave election for Democrats it's I mean the\nOnly thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what else has happened I\nDid have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors\nHere's the tuition where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand aging polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls are for that laughter okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrants caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine for going to say that if\nThis is our whole lives that this is going to be interesting it is like it's like\nYou know back in the nineties the opening of Star Wars yeah this is now what people care about and they care about it in almost a cultural entertainment sort of way be which is I think fascinating\nAnd not necessarily healthy that's good that people care about these things but you know I don't think that people a lot of people don't seem to care about them about the issues as much as they do about just a passionate disagreement with whoever they're on

one and Rachel Maddow is often number two there are still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our\nMedia as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring them [noise]\nSo what he is are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... a a blurb assuming I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment\nIs the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe a ... day we believe that\nOur citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity\nThat's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness\nAlmost all of the happiness literature if you will out there it's confirming stuffed up wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia which\nIs that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest\nAnd statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that\nThose things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless\nWe can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nEnds up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I Want to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and what\nYou write about with deep fakes um you seem to be one of

personalities a lot of times and media inflammation kind of a lot of stuff he's talking about in the book right wind up summarizing a person but you look at ... ... even with Trump in office and he's

want if you want to be if you're pro terrorists now I mean but I mean the conservative position for multiple decades going back to Ronald Reagan is is is is not protection and oh so he's the one being

give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class ... and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators\nBecause here's the problem with getting ready to testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding it's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we could still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones say nice things because I cross the entire state might say that sixty two counties across all if you do I'm going to fool sharply by the way\nFor you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders than teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state\nAnd the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things\nBut I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten the last two years of high school for too many kids\nIs Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids it's thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWest terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we used to say\nI Wonder why hasn't the work ethic we've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who would tell me literally Larry I won't hire anybody with a work ethic and one on channel told me he said Laurie\nMy interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired and that's how bad\nIt is for people to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system that I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test they get high school diploma\nNumber one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college\nThe problem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think cause you write to me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who have not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story\nNow okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and gets into your degree why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things no worries go to a two year trade school choice to become a plumber corporate or whatever you want to be a mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I Love my six year old\nI'm fifty a ... year old my problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in the U.S is doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job why not go learn to work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people might you know the initial go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five\nLearn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of sounds great how do you pay for\nNew York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through drought write a paper last two years to I still pay for here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're sixteen you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck his ... his wife ... going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great place called papa\nGuess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most\nGuaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to make these will pop up it'll be amazing there's the best part when he schools pop up now we're spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid\nSo we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times to four hundred thousand a lot of talk better is more than four billion dollars we've said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we'd given teachers up a ... a better chance to actually teach\nWe've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core a we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while\nThey are murders at at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now think about this dilemma twelfth grade you're not allowed to twelfth grader\nYou're in a class with everyone who wants to be there to build their kid isn't there to build the kitchen something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully\nBut now he go someplace else your teacher lemon twelfth grade\nDiscipline problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught what's killing our children isn't guns what's going on children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that feeling I get\nPut them in these worlds all that goes away I Can't go to my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class\nI Can't go to the ... the the farm and he's been a fix a tractor I got things to do I've I've purpose I meaning I don't do things like that anymore\nWe're living in a world of massive change yeah massive change and

here in Omaha all news radio eleven ... bay\n\nThat probably was Larry sharp I'm doing a story on candidate a for a for New York or\nShe is libertarian and uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his\nHis policies are different than the Republican and the Democrats and I believe they're they're very workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything why we're still looking at a system uh you know that feels like the old Soviet site styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things\nUm you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for governor to impede business\nPeriod no ifs ands or buts if I don't like in the industry or I don't like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief\nI should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's only he's\nNot only doing that she's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance forest firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more well how do they mean insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for for any kind a firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do that's how it works in the state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight\nAnd we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act\nCompliant say fact was passing twenty Thirteen and it's a fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent felon it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking district story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the ... because of that\nIn other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire\nWell now you're a felon again vision of them are not going to come up this and this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing\nIt is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy ... constantly who project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a business man\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years and I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's ascendant thrown\nOver a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet right in it yes it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions do sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises jak people who work their whole life and were promised ally yeah what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas was your belief for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas she said already already happening all the time you're\nIn New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... so ... is a critical right now Penn is er about Fifteen sixteen percent of our budget\nAnd a budget is a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida and Florida has more people than us yes for his about eighty five billion and the more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the buses are getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that\nA New York state has about a three hundred million dollar debt and about a fortified deficit\nSo it's a bad bad bad and they were you at the people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund as good their right to fund itself is relatively well some of the ups they ... up and you're doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall sorting well they don't realize it's being also funded\nBy our tax base a budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is in the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget\nAt one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're saying in Dallas\nAnd my response that goes on his but Larry's and the constitution\nYeah and I get that asked Detroit right at and Puerto Rico right at Venezuela ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for her to be something like that and I'm going to go shoot with every single union that will take forever I Know\nThat's why I say it's a four year plan it's a four year plan to make us with New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a ... percent is that sustainable because the issue we have is a a lot of people were pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they don't even use anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters reporting one now it's one supporting tend to Iraq I think actually were supporting for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making the biggest\nThing I think are supporting three or four or so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying lie wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them on the other one talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening if you have if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "28"}
