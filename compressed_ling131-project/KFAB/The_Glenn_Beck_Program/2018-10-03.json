I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who am I ...\n... ... the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and and just created this incredible innovation where a person\nFrom firing one you know must get shot once a minute or maybe twice a minute to shooting five times in mere seconds he was also just an innovator in in in marketing in selling himself in and using the press to to to sell sell to other people and using and using\nEngineering to to create something that he can make cheaper so their normal American than normal man the normal woman can get their hands on it and um changed the west it changed the way that the relationship a person has with with a weapon and I'm\n... you know he was before Henry Ford he was using interchangeable parts it was like first industrial revolution so he was just amazing man and almost it was my favorite chapter to right I think she needs you know more ...\nTo check on him yeah so I'm\nHere we are at the the one year anniversary of a Las Vegas shooting of Las Vegas [noise] um did you and you're looking through history did you ever find another time in American history and I should say you know a pre progressive\nUh where guns had been viewed in America as anything but good\n[noise] no I I sort of actually you know in in the in the nineteenth century guns were sort of idealized romance books and things of that nature it wasn't until the thirty is really when I started to think about a ...\nFor some good reason people running around with machine guns shooting up places you don't get caught one else where so I mean there was a legitimate fear that some people had [noise] um but before that time no one even thought to limit\nGun ownership in any way I mean certain places in the west maybe they have certain areas where you couldn't have a gun because everyone was drunk and fighting but generally no one had to go and ask the government the state uh for a God I think in fact that when you think about\nThe second amendment how you think about the ideals behind it tells us a lot about how do you think about freedom in general I think you're pretty authoritarian if you think that the individual shouldn't be able to defend themselves in a rather should rely solely on the state\nYou know given people enough time to actually read it which is nice yeah I think he wanted to do this like the day after I did and everybody reads that fast so [laughter] so it's been out for weeks now and if you've read it or let's talk about it on because there's all there's a\nTon a ton in their\n... I think it explained so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like all the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this happened I think yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime\nIn in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the entire effort of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at it sound like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just doesn't make any sense and it's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book because I think it is the perfect example maybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah\nUh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way a\nAnd the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy\nAnd to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blow their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted to outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if

[noise]\n... at the Glenn ... All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Capitol which again\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you that's up in the area important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role\nThat relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge or or ah or I'm a attorney general general attorney general would be good one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's cause for certain candidates\nOr who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nA by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the capital case in the aisles the case\nOf the cabinet case happened uh thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but I saw in different ...\nA professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we do not remember with Ford we have no even fence that there was a relationship of any sort between Oregon Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nLike ... ... they both have a note from their W around those cases at the the Ford case yeah what's something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which you refer to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling that would never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison ... I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries ah um and that kind of a difference to you might you might know it's a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or that do to do to actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this was I going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting\nMe yeah and she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being fortunate to have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening\nFord named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax um\nWritings um the pictures and they are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real time real\nTime and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that time yeah\nBut ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well it was yesterday or\nTape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm\nOf course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the veil and right and\nWe don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more and I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case there however\nUm what's interesting about this is that\nFifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume\nThat if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her 'cause she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's\nAn infinity amount times more evidence and the elephant case\nYet only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations\nAgainst Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh but there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was amount on cabinet and I would yeah I Would if if if the evidence was\nThe same thing yeah [noise]\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and for hundreds of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there is in the legal standard because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you'll have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships breakup or someone feels jolted say things that are not true I hadn't been all that I agree

that's what's happening now Trump mocked zha victim ...\nStew I've got a few words for you to look up that I think America needs a refresher course on\nCould you look up victim ha ha\nI mean I think that's definitely one of the word victim Glenn victims in down by the way we should point out that yesterday around this time we look at the word booth yeah so the devil's triangle so this is this different court is a little bit a victim that was the one oh one class [laughter]\nA person harmed injured or killed as a result of a crime accidents or other event direction a person armed and\nKilled or injured yeah a as a result of a crime or an accident ... okay well the one interesting thing as an observation here Glenn on the victim is if you call her a victim\nYou are condemning his guilt\nOh you have already decided the case if you call her a victim huh when you are in a headline for example and you say he ... a mock victim\nWhat your saying is Brett Kavanaugh Kevin always guilty correct so you're saying it without having to say what you're saying what you should say instead could you look up the word accuser accuser yes here okay a accuser accuser\nA person who claims oh wait this is starting to sound accurate it is a person who claims that someone has committed in a fence or done something wrong okay so in at all sure either her an accuser\nSo he wasn't mocking he was stating the facts of the trial or the or the hearing\nAnd a A N\nCondensing the ridiculous ... of the accusers claim\nWe must stop using the word victim\nThey are accusers they may end up being a victim that we can call them but if we're going to presume innocence and I know this is an old fashioned idea if you're going to presume innocence\nYou must presume innocence which means this is the accuser your honor this is not the victim because one she's a victim\nWhat happens well we're supposed to believe could you look up the word believe [noise] uh yes I I can we are now being taught believe the victim\nBelieve okay ah two definitions of the word belief mhm definition number one except something that is true feels shore\nOf the truth of okay just your or something is true so people now are saying believe the victim which is translating feel sure that this person has been harmed or injured\nIn a in an event of some sort okay and end up in this area and his response ... yes okay do you are being told\nWhen someone says something I have to believe\nAnd assume that we give me the definition again except something is true I have to accept this as true field sure and feel sure that it's true that this person has been harmed or went through an act caused by this person\nWow that's a that's quite a statement that doesn't seem logical\nAt all but should only happen after ... ... you know that would beyond a reasonable doubt write like that for a standard is there what's the second version of believe um hold something as an opinion ... sink or suppose\nThat seems like the one they're replying yes they're just trying to make it seem like I Believe you I'm sure the truth when in reality it's just their opinion there supposing it's true\nMhm they think it's true now do you want to be judged or have your dad your brother your son your sister your mother your friend\nHave so world assume that if something is true because someone stated it with out evidence the
