desk was a document to get ready to spend over one billion\nDollars to build a building I said how do you spend a billion dollars to build a building I didn't look but probably like one story is an embassy why do stores a billion dollars and I said maybe we can get a building and renovated and fix it up real fast and who knows [noise] and our great are great ah\nAmbassador to Israel David Friedman gold you said you know we have the best site in Jerusalem and there's a beautiful building on him and we can take just a big corner of the building [noise] mix it up and instead of waiting twenty or twenty five years by the time this thing work that we can have it in about four monster [noise]\nI\nSaid what do you mean besides the best she said well we were there early we decide for many years the building is good but you know we have to renovate so we're going to spend a billion and probably never get it up and write and by the way he\nBut at the billion would end up costing three or four billion for you know people would look at it probably one third the size of this room they'll spend ... billion dollars [noise]\nEspecially David how much is it going to cost to do that and how good is this such such great and sure the building is ... way back which is good for purposes of security that they don't want to write on the sidewalk I Can't imagine why\n[noise] the way back he says search beautiful and it's a big ... we can do other things later [noise]\nI don't know how much is you're going to go he said sir it's going to cost\nAbout a hundred and eighty thousand dollars I told him\nI don't think [noise]\nHundred and eighty [noise] first\nTime in my life I've ever done this first time don't get angry at me as David is too cheap it doesn't sound good [noise]\nI

billion eggs that go back a day letter supposedly took over one point six billion I said you have to do ... [noise]\nI actually didn't actually said it in half okay but we don't have to go through the whole deal but with the with the with the embassy I said David David hundred and eighty thousand just too cheap [noise]\nWe spend more than that it doesn't sound good but sure I can do really I said I Know you can but it's not going to play well you mean we took it from a billion dollars to a hundred and eighty thousand [noise] today I said you know what David naked four hundred thousand [noise] news\nJurors looms zones and everybody was is the most beautiful stuff [noise] and you were in Jerusalem right I mean what's probably inexpensive most expensive stone when you bring it here but you're in Jerusalem\nThey should have plenty of address [noise] I said David used\nBeautiful Jerusalem stone panelists we opened it up for months later for four hundred thousand\nDollars [noise] I could\nTell you many of these stories I get your money [noise] I could\nTell you so many of these ... that story and I I got thirty more we can talk about the way we spent he says I Want to hear more\n[noise]\nOr give you one more of those [noise]\nSo [noise] we like South Korea [noise] we've got thirty two thousand soldiers over there\nThank you very much United States they don't pay [noise]\nThey don't pay\nBut [noise] they're very successful [noise] and\nThe Obama administration game this incredible door I\n[noise] don't worry as being mostly dismantled [noise]\n[noise] so\nMy first week in office I get there and I notice there's this incredible bad system bad system to knock down rockers used on rockets used our missiles most incredible thing you've ever see I think they got like a Ninety seven percent shot at it [noise]\nAnd the company likes to say but if you said the two missiles you get it a hundred percent but that's expensive I said do it with one right [noise]\nSo I get there and brand new ...
