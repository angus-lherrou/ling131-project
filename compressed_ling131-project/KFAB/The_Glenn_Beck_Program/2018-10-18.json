saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said\nIt's time to bring the guillotine out for the Republicans I'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets\nYou um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] well I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nA with five hundred signatures are attached to it so the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have\nUm some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ... possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ashes really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it\nThey they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive the most and arch elements in our society the press sympathizes with all of that\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive\nCauses so ... that's a big\nDifference we didn't have that what was it a left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's what we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties those some of them we don't have it that we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say as a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king um the rules where you just never swing back\nA that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties\nPress played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out\nWhich is what happened is that an over the weekend is that and you know he grew up\nDoing that would have to hire security they'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes\nTakes leadership it takes organization but but on the pressure thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because\nThe press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly still\nTry to do with Trump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and\nThe middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation when in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him\nBecause we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of\nCountries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nAnd then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and then you turn around and go the unintended\nSequential that is that the whole alliance against Iran falls apart at a wine is empowered eight times as much as they are now\nAnd so is the Brotherhood\nYeah and and the and the left wing press doesn't care what happened ISIS did it have you seen one article from the mainstream media about how the Trump Administration destroyed ISIS\nNo have you seen one and no under Obama ISIS ran wild and killed tens of thousands of innocent people for eight years for eight years Trump gets in there and the first year he wipes\nThem out because\nOf math is the defense secretary and he didn't do it in a very public way it was all done behind the scenes\nBut you can get those articles you can get those stories All right now even tried to get them\nAll right so bill here's here's the problem with with Saudi Arabia as I see it you're exactly right you know we're in we're in a no win situation in fact I think we're going to lose lose situation here\nStanding with people who we've known forever de de do this kind of thing all the time yeah ah they're bad people we shouldn't have been in bed with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the first place but we were and now\nThey're they're I'm a strong ally that is one of the only ones that is standing up for Israel at least quietly\nFighting the Muslim Brotherhood and fighting Iran\nThey we have a lot of aligned interest even though I don't want to be in bed with them but now how do you get out if if a kid out\nWell but wait a minute Saudi Arabia this is different because if there is a tape of this guy being dismembered while he was alive this will set the world on fire it's different\nAnd new sanctions Saudi Arabia in a way that hurts them but doesn't destroy\nSo I had forgotten this yesterday [noise]\nSometimes the days are long uh yesterday I did an interview with Bill

I don't have the one I'm right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign or him here just yeah I Know there's only buy so much heat up a age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is that by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same\nIs it the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are split\nYup for example much more people are ... are voting for\nGreg habit that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um\nThe you'd think of is bright red country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows the fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance and only forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters words a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas it this way try this on for size\nAh a\nDonald Trump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right and it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life\nUm and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ... you\nKnow so she is such a big figure in everybody's life Ted Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job\nOkay mhm I'm Greg Abbott is just doing a good job and nobody's talking about nobody's talking about\nBecause the state's running great everything's going really well he's a great governor he's not controversial so I think the poll numbers are just how much is this person impacted my life\nIn a kind of in a bad way of oh I got to deal with this again today I got to talk about this again you can get get get get into fatigue or Indiana yeah yeah yeah and it's not a bad thing about any of them it's just like\nOh I'm so tired of this ... you know it's like the closer you get to Washington Greg Abbott is here Ted Cruz's in Washington but you know really the epicenter now and with the last\nPresident is the White House and so the closer you get the more you're like oh enough\nYeah I it's it's a it's an interesting thing I mean I it's nice to see I think\nYou know especially if ... hold on to this race which seems like he will at the moment ah it going to help a lot of other candidates in really close race but there are six tossup races right now uh Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Montana and Nevada all of them are are very tight um you know\nThe fact that this thirty eight million dollars is not flowing into a race in that group is a real positive for Republicans I did Democrats are very excited about better but I mean his chances of winning are very low\nAnd and they've just thrown money at a candidate who has essentially I mean a very small chance of winning I Would say it's no chance for a very small chance of winning and you know that's only benefiting Republican chances of keeping the Senate\nBut they are here's what's happening they've made him into a national figure ... you know they're already by putting him on Ellen why why is he on the island\nHuh I Wonder if he doesn't get done he's he's responsible for absolutely nothing right he's not he's not something like up and coming outsider right like he's a guy who's been in Congress for a long time or he has been in politics for very long time\nI thought you were done I mean I I doubt\nAshford Tony ...

Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is tense of right I mean remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nWhat they saw Bush as the bad guy who ... who was who's incompetent Brock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything and it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult\nDecision and five hundred years since the Harlem Harlem me there was a decision made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking admission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options in and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on with investigate this before we act irrationally if for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's\nNot being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered a potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there and ... and all we can talk about is what ... why\nDonald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like is it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still well that'd be age\nYeah should be um breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff but it's kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority for top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey\nRight like ... I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so she studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like ... you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why he captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative and there's a lot at\nStake here a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they are going to retaliate and it's it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nOil that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well I think we get scant little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nA cheese crossed in ... before you take any severe action I Would think\nYou know look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be factored tuition we think we've seen that\nHappening too infrequently over the past few decades and it and and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are sponsored this half hour zip recruiter or if you go to these job sites a lot of times you know it's great to be able to post ... ... ah you know to a bunch of job sites and you know you can get a lot of candidates but you can also get overwhelmed with tons and tons of candidates that are not good candidates they had the wrong resumes day the wrong experience\nJust no point in doing that you know then you're gonna wind up jamming up\nYour entire business looking through terrible resumes zipper critter has your back or go to zipper critter dot com slash back unlike other jobs ... doesn't wait for candidates to find you dip recruiter find them for you\nIt has powerful matching technology scans thousands of resumes and identify people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively invite them to apply so you get qualified candidates really really fast you have to sort through all the wrong resumes you don't have to wait for candidates or to apply you gonna get tons of them but you get good ones\nIt's no wonder is there a recruiter is rated number one by employers in the United states and right now you can try super critter for free at the exclusive Web address zipper critter dot com flashback go their zipper critter dot com slash back go their check it out for free it's the smartest way to hire zip recruiter dot com slash back [noise]\n...

to warn you about something that's incredibly dangerous in our society and all too prevalent in that the Disney\nIs um we're being worn by ah some Hollywood actresses that\nThere is some danger there Karen nightly is promoting a her upcoming movie which was produced by Disney by the way the nutcracker the four realms\nBut she told Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday that she's not a fan of every movie the studios produce because Disney Princess is don't uphold her feminist values ... so she is forbidden her three year old daughter eighty from watching certain movies like Cinderella which is\nA been banned in her household because she waits around for a rich guy to rescue her\nAnd she says don't rescue yourself obviously and this is the one I'm\nBut she ... she's mad because Cinderella waits to be rescued and there's not ... as a\nSelf yes she didn't pull herself out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man or a man yeah thank you ... there's a lot of women are doing that today\nThe main message ... or ... of really the entire movie a is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a especially a rash of rich guy that's\nThe message you should be taking from those movies I'm Kristen Bell is also fearful that Disney princes are sending the wrong message to her children she's actually the voice of the Disney Princess uh Anna and frozen wasn't that done by Christian Bale yes [laughter]\nSo she tells her daughter's Lincoln and delta that ah when she read when she read Snow White del taco bell yes and Lincoln bell yes and when she read Snow White two inch closes up the book and she says every time we close no white I look at my girls and ask\nDo you think it's weird that Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple\nI say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like okay I'm doing something right yeah you've proved it a\nWhile you nailed that one there he did wrist and then she'll also say and girls don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her\nPermission\nWell no because she's in a coma mom [laughter]\nKid camera permission and she'll say in a coma if he doesn't\nCancer right I mean she's advocating for the Gilman can continue right the kids what gives her out of it\nRight and bell says or because you can't get someone if they're sleeping\nOn the how does that mean in my circumstances [noise] that's true however this is a notable circumstance which is why it's a movie in a book right the reason why you know about it is because it's different than everyday life right ... you know there there's a magical apple\nThere's a a prince or that I was a magical spell brown the princess yeah and she's sleeping 'cause she can't wake up right unless the prince\nKisses her that's kind of the premise that yeah so it's a it's a unique circumstance that pretty sure lessons don't apply to [laughter] so silly so weird I even get yourself still worked up about\nThat I Know what I Hope happens every day is every day when she brings breakfast to them they asked her well where did\nThis come from [laughter] they just torture her with the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause I knew that I can understand this you know sometimes\nI I think even you know like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things uh like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon the kids were watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I was a captain planets or whatever do that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is emitted yeah they you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this might have been type of pig or something it's usually type of thing I like to pick a lot a and a pet but it was talking about you\nKnow recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't looking as recycling whatever like I don't have any\nPassion for recycling I think there's some some ah\nThere's some conflicting evidence as to what good does a there's been several studies that have shown not much not much if any clearly you work for all cola I apparently not know but uh yeah like I don't know do I really need\nA giant a commercial about environmental is among my kids programming I I feel like no no but I mean he also can get a little bit worked up about that stuff you know I mean you can get a little a little fired up with trying to find the political messages and these things even if there is there I mean kids\nGrow up into you know adults second thing for themselves\nAnd you know you kinda have to at some point\nI realized that you're not going to be able to control every little bit of that you can just you can do your best and I guess with her values probably the most important thing is to point out I mean she's probably doing you know I'm very worried about uh you know she thinks Brett Kavanaugh's are everywhere and and at any point they're going to be an assault going on and\nYou know I mean maybe this is this is consistent with what she wants to pass along to me it's just\nIt's a lot of it is and I remember when people are concerned conservatives were concerned mostly uh about some of these Disney movies because of the things that they put in the Disney movies like\nI'm In the is it the rescuers are the rescuers down under one of those\nUh there's a scene where the character is going down a street on I don't know some type of vehicle and there's a woman a on the ... in one of the buildings they passed that naked\nFor just a ... I remember hearing that yea so conservatives would talk about that and it would be oh\nWho's Dopp it you can't even see that that's it's a blend mental you don't even know it's there and then there was the lion king a scene where a Simba as as a grown lie and\nHow to plop down on the side of a cliff and the dust shoots up informs the word sex\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy three after Fifteen Years of construction the Sydney opera houses dedicated by Queen Elizabeth the second the ... million dollar structure designed by Danish architect you wanted to send and funded by the profits of the opera house lotteries\nCurrently presents an average of three thousand events a year to an estimated ... million people\nAnd this week in Nineteen eighty five is the first blockbuster video rental store opens in Dallas texas at a time when most video stores were small scale operations featuring a limited selection of titles blockbuster open with some eight thousand tapes displayed on shelves around the store and a computerized checkout process\nThe first or was a huge success in blockbuster expanded rapidly apparently there is only one blockbuster video store less today and it's in Bend Oregon Vassar\nLook back at this week in history you listen and imagine\n[noise]\nIt takes five seconds to send a text and for those five seconds\nYoure driving blind life is worth more than a text stay alive don't text and drive\nStopped ... a message by the by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration project yellow light noise and the ad council\nOmaha is news traffic in weather news radio eleven ten K.
