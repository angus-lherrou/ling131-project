Fox News President Trump holding the first time a series of rallies was less than a week to go until the mid term\nReally didn't produce much and in fact he was really allowed to just you know create a lot of victims so a lot of the victims of Bolger are still very angry with the federal government and the department of\nJohn who ruin the victims be\n... a ... you know dozens of families who were the victims of white he's crimes I mean Whitey would\nOh I see what you're saying but he did he put anybody behind bars did he have does he ran out anybody that\nIn the end of the government get anything [noise]\nUh that's open to debate the Boston Globe would tell you that yes yes he was a wonderful and form and then that they broke the story but there's evidence to suggest that it was a it was a greater cover for just protecting Whitey\nBecause with the uh a federal authorities trying to crack down on the mob or the Italian Mafia\nUh any hit on the mafia would have to run through\nA Bulger's winter hill gang and some people feel and claim and there was strong evidence to suggest that the informing part\nWas just the cover and really they were allowing Whitey the live so that the then head of the strike force in New England to bring down the Italian Mafia a guy named Jeremiah Tio Sullivan was looking for a little quid pro quo like hey Whitey we'll let you do your thing\nAs long as you make sure the ... the mob doesn't you know kill me\nBecause there were incidence of lawyers and prosecutors are getting killed in retaliation for bringing down the mob\nSo you know a lot of those allegations have not been proven but his real connection to the information that he gave as being actually great invalid and information is is to me one of the myth of this case\nUh you know we'd we'd need much longer\nTime period to really discuss it but the documentary kinda delves into the\nHow much free reign the guy was given and again if you're an informant for the government\nIt doesn't mean you can go and commit crimes that means you're working hand in hand with the government in exchange for some benefit like a ... like not being prosecuted or a lesser sense it doesn't mean oh please go out and Rob kills steel and maim people\nAnd there were there have been several civil suits brought against ah the department of justice I have not gone and the families a\nDirection and so there's a lot of there's still a lot of bitter feelings amongst the people who were who were victims of Bulger's crimes some of them were you know criminals themselves but that doesn't that doesn't\nNecessarily minor the end doesn't justify the means to arrive\nFor this guy for a quarter century uh was allowed to just kill with impunity I mean he was tipped off in advance a about wiretaps he was tipped off in advance about potential rates are so it's really a complicated and in fact some people believe that\nThe sixteen years he was on the lam living in an apartment in Santa Monica with his girlfriend Catherine Greek\nUh there there are many including myself who believe that the government really wasn't all looking very hard for him until a new regime came in and then after sixteen years they decided to bring him to justice and and there was a trial in the summer of twenty thirties\nSo let's talk a little bit about the first myth that you talked about that he was known as a you know a good guy in the neighborhood isn't that\n... I mean this is my impression and maybe I'm wrong in this isn't that kind of the thing with you know Al Capone tried to do that and\nYou know people like to think that I don't know these guys are just you know they're whack in just the bad guys there actually good family man you know and there was a day when you would kill a man and then you'd send his wife flowers yeah\nIs that any of that true\nA ... that that seems to be the case that uh you know he also did some very good thing\nIt was as well you know for at times but for for some people um and also for example there was a big bussing crisis in South Boston you know a there was an attempt to\nDesegregate and there was a a bussing order issued an Whitey actually was very vociferous ... you know in campaigning against it and that kind of rallied south Boston residents are ... to him um\nHe was a good guy but because I I mean that helped create cover for him and he'll\nYeah exactly and his brother was a famous politician so there was all you can\nUse in there as well you know with a will you know build Bolger president of the University of Massachusetts in a prominent politician I'm so there was a lot of messy gray areas there with the ...\nHow did he was he involved with the just the guy saying yay whack him or was he involved in the killings\nOh he he took pleasure [laughter] and and being involved in the killings and you know his his signature because back then there was no DNA evidence his signature was removing teeth\nOf his victims um you know uh so that they couldn't be identified but no no he was a it was a willing and ruthless participating in some very grisly murders\nHad there was a there was a there was a a\nNeighborhood house that they had called the haunting where a number of these victims were buried in the in the dirt basement of of the actual house that they used as a meeting place\nSo there's ... there's just so he makes\nA lot of grisly details with with this case but uh\nI mean the real for me the fascinating thing is after sixteen years on the land they finally caught him in\nSanta Monica living quiet you know living a a quiet a life a retirees life you know he had a ... almost nine hundred thousand dollars in cash and stuck in the walls and the coterie of a machine guns and weapons but living out just a quiet life and when he's finally\nCaught and brought back in\nBoston for trial you know he offered to plead guilty in exchange for this is another\nI've been looking at some of the notices and these are some of the things that have been left out you know he offered to plead guilty if they would take it easy on his girlfriend has you know who is living girlfriend Catherine Greek who joined him for the sixteen years of being on the run\nOn and off you know he ... he was willing to plead guilty if they would take it easy on her and give her some very light treatment a and the government refused and you have to ask yourself why why did we go through a multimillion dollar\nTrial a four Whitey Bolger when the ... you know the ... the conclusion was foregone at\nThe smarter than trial nobody thought he would be found not guilty I mean the evidence was just overwhelming um and it\nProbably would have saved the state uh quite a bit of money to not try him but but ah they didn't take it easy on um um how they can grow up and how they catch him\nOr are there what is it you know they decided to focus on the girlfriend and they play some advertisements a and a woman ... you know noticed ah not Whitey but the girlfriend and called in and got a nice word for that\nSo ape slowly prosecuted the woman who turned him in\nA well no no no no not the woman who turned\nOh another okay another woman did not the girlfriend another woman correct I mean okay okay yeah now he was killed yesterday I never I I I mean I besides Dr seuss I didn't know who would come up with a lock in a sock\nA buddy apparently was was killed by a guy they think is where they I should say is there is a guy in prison who was a mob hit man who they think killed him they know where he was a mob hit man I'm who would\nWas everybody against this guy was he marked for death as soon as they could kill him\nA well look I don't I don't have the details of yesterday and it's you know it's hard to say but you know he is responsible for helping\nOr you know bring down the Italian Mafia so you would imagine that uh there would be people who would be out for his his death a and you have to question you know the\nThe security and uh you know it's still unclear to me I'm Still trying to get some information as to why he was being moved and why the multiple moves and why the lack of security\nUh you know some people are speculating that this was a purposeful move uh I I Can't say that but um you know a guy who's involved in\nMultiple murders over decades and involved in bringing down the mafia or you know with ... with you know be a target\nWhere we are talking to a job earlier he is the director of why the United states of America versus James James Bulger who's the you know Whitey um and ... um I guess\nWhat was it that it ... due to the story why why did you make the film and what did you what attracted you to it and what did you take away from it [noise]\nYeah I mean I thought\nThat ah you know\nBolger finally bringing being brought to trial because there's there's such a myth about the guy there's such folklore [noise] you know in our society is unfortunately we tend to glamorize eras out of criminals\nTo ... hours behind because the machinery

involved but the top two are are going to have to have a run off again so uh he just needs to make it into the top two and he could be the next Senate\nAh or senator or for the United states out of Mississippi I'm as a state senator since two thousand eight\nHe has written in sponsored a ton of legislation in Mississippi he has a fought for private property rights restrict the use of eminent domain\nThe student religious liberties act he authored and passed into law to protect the rights of students to pray in school he introduced the firearms freedom Protection Act to protect against federal encroachment on Second Amendment rights\nFought against government paternal isn't by sponsoring legislation to allow citizens opt out requirements to provide personal private information and

feel like we ... we want it twenty four teams the establishment stole this seat and now we walk this seat back on the conservative and I'd like to fight Washington DC\nSo what does it mean to be a conservative now Chris\nWelcome back expected it made the same thing that always tell Jeffersonian a Reagan Goldwater construct ... where we demand limited government we demand individual responsibility we demand liberty we have to trend toward liberty and everything that we do\nAt some point along the way this country we abdicated responsibility for self government they get it over to the federal government is how to explain that authority so in everything that we do or empowering individual not to collect we're putting people on pedestals not politician that's what it means\nAll right so tell me telling you just a few things where you stand what'd you think of um a cabin up [noise]\nI like it I feel like I used by the Democrats ... ... any what the evidence that I saw a ... actually no proof\nThat he committed any act if that's the case I drove through process that are preserved and the burden was on her not ill he didn't have to prove its end up as to what she had to

of the previous care and you know she could very easily be why is all being completed\nAnd the idea that you know that they would not even acknowledge okay well yeah sure he funded the last one but

vice president has said and then we have this also I think from the governor of Texas didn't he alluded to this is well he ... he at that it that it was coming from an old sources and vice president
