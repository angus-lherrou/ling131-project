you have to remind me of a scarcity of money we're about to hit scarcity of money which is all tied in to the spending bill and it'll boggle your mind\nWhen you see oh well you know it doesn't matter

in business is now that's that's not a welfare state oh you're a conspiracy theorist weight she just said it\nAt one point of it first of all the ... you know the press is a collection of individuals\nSome of what you do a good job some of which do not\nAh so it's important to make those distinctions I think um and you know look at that is they\nThis was just this is going on at our

you know if we're not\nWe know what the ... we know a republic if you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was

I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat and you\nKnow here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront ape face to face right and you know there's nothing on the left\nThere even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute an emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there\nSo here's where I think than was wrong when he said to deal with the ... um he was right when he said you know it's a small group it's a small room\nHe's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nAnd he said part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the ... right\nRight you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that um you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when what bunch of Nazis or KKK members that's been

K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids\nIs Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college west terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say\nI Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job because he's he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one of ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and it for a new computer all day ... that a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year ... to ... is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fans love\nI'm a doctor who then we go back to the game not sure about the new Dr ... being a female but that's a different\nStory down okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and gets into your degree why should they be boarding school and they shouldn't be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things no worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber corporate or whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty\n... that's a problem I Love my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and you know to to doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss to show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth grade I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're sixteen you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use a good look\nHere's an here's why I promise is going to happen a bunch of cool prep schools will pop up\nBunch of great trade schools will pop up guess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere is the best part when he schools pop up now we're spending ten thousand dollars per kid per last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars

F. A. B. I highly radio [noise]\n\nPlan that probably was Larry sharp I'm doing a story will candidate a for a for New York or she\nIs a libertarian and uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrat and I believe they're very very workable in a in an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system or you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but I'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with\nThe big banks ... uh and the big banks a\nCuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for governor to impede business period\n... no ... if I don't like in the industry or like something and I said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief\nI should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always not only\nDoing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nAbsolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often it's normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around it eat X right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants insurance forest firearm now we can't get it\nThere's no way that the individuals and there are at least for me and I'm gun owners in New York state if not more\nWell how do they need insurance now when when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nFor any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you are making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passed in twenty Thirteen and the the fact that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent selling it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops wars that have been revamped or because of that in other words but it now if you are retired cop once you retire well now you're a felon again\nBecause you know I'm going back to the cop\nThis and this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy constantly project I care about\nA little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a business man\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's ascendant thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nRight in it yes it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're ... we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb\nYes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises to people who work their whole life and were promised ally yep what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas with your place for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you said already already happening and they have all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... so pensions are critical right now pending or about Fifteen sixteen percent of our budget\nAnd a budget as a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida in Florida has more people than us wow yes for his about eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred billion dollar debt and about a four to five day now deficit\nSo it's a bad bad bad and then you add that people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is doing relatively well some of the ups they ... up and you're doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall certain well they don't realize it's being also funded\nBy our tax base our budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is and the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget\nAt one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're saying in Dallas and my response of times but Larry's in the constitution yeah and I get that\nAsked Detroit right at and Puerto Rico\nRight at Venezuela ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right here which is some type of four one K. for three to be something like that and I'm going to go she with every single union that will take forever I Know that's why I say it's a four year plan\nIt's a four year plan to make us away from New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a flat percentage that sustainable because the issue we have is a a lot of people are pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they don't even use anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters supporting one now it's one supporting tend to Iraq I think she was a ... for for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making them I think it's on I think it was supporting three or four\nThe looking at this couple if you look at look at them both they look relatively of similar age\nOK okay so it's not like the creepy Harvey Weinstein looking guy at the\n... ah when he graduated high school wants to marry me you know it's not one of those kind of a catch a ... something like that they're relatively of the same age wow I just wanted to point out you didn't have to buy a woman a Lamborghini\nAnd then put on a fireworks display and somehow that gave you the confidence okay now show marry me mhm you got married on your own accord I'm a good\nPerson I'm worthy I'll be a great life partner\nCan we spend our lives together I Love you love me yes my love each other this guy comes at her with hey I can you pass this up I get all this money and putting on a fireworks display here's a they they get a a guy comes in with a Dali\nTo give her the engagement ring [noise]\nIt's like an eight billion carrot it looks like\nAn wow wild you brought up money yeah what's up I thought you chicks love money\nSo I just want to point this out I Love you know he's ... but I have money no matter what no matter what your challenges are you're going to be able to meet them because you're not a guy who faces his entire existence over the fact that he's got money\nYou're not a guy that things have just because you've got money you can have every woman in the world\nAnd this is a love affair and you're not a guy who believes just because you can buy something you get to keep it [noise]\nThat guy because Becker radio program [noise] went back is next right after your next opportunity to get a thousand bucks hey get this thousand bucks needs to be on your way to get a Lamborghini for somebody [noise] except I'll bet you money to stick around [noise]\nAll right that opportunity is just minutes away here on news radio eleven ten K.

I Want to talk to you about a couple things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas or what\nDoes this or what does this tell you and how that turned out the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote or for your listeners what we're saying with regard to the turnout is a smash them records are not just for mid term elections which is what this is a but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds or the amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day\nAnd so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote will notice park but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure we like to be critical to do something to stop it but here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas it would be clear about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election here because there are other people out there who are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nNeed to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said yeah that's the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing I'm a election is it not\nWhile he captured the as soon as very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either ran under no label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and then they were a progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor in Florida a as an out and now that he says he is a\nSocialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism if not even further to the lab and the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies\nThat is socialism a with a look at the uh wealth distribution policies that is so she lives in the Hitler people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate and Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't ... I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknown to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into the state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a half a million dollars or directly to candidates in Harris County down in Houston\nBut this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that has funded these ground game stick it out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into California and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your question\nAnd listeners think about this uh all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and blue counties you have a Dallas year after year to have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso and so you have these massive\nBlue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able to\nCobble together the votes that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas the passion of freedom to back to the liberty or in the passion of conservatism and so uh every vote counts and we really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were\nAh it last night where we were from Texas I'm I'm Sorry what people are fired up and they are ready but we need people to go vote\nTell me a little bit about the caravan is there or do we have any idea other than the you know political leanings of this group\nUh when it was back in Honduras do we have any idea just the logistics who is behind this and what we're prepared to do\nSir I've had the opportunity to speak with both the secretary of homeland security as well as the president about this and I I can tell you what I can tell you publicly and and that is a if you think these are people who are leaving Honduras or about a mile or wherever that coming from or just trying to escape violence\nAnd income seek asylum or that is incorrect\nUh this is very well organized it's funded has a there are there are others who are behind this and very importantly a end this caravan are not just people from Honduras Guatemala a we know that some of the leaders of it are involved in their most Thirteen we don't we know that some of the people in it are from\nCountries across the entire globe are there are what we used in the in the lingo ... which are a special interest ATMs or who are posed a a very real dangerous threat or to the security of the United states of America who are in bed in these caravans\nRight ...
