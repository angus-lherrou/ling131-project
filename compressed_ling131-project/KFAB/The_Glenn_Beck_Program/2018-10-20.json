know maybe you'll have to find it there\nAre but we're we're ah we're here talking about a Beto O'Rourke at Ted Cruz and the Texas Senate battle\nA lot of people calling in and saying that they knew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the community that he talked about on CNN last night and they look there's ...\nIt could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are uh you know from the\nDifferent cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of look into as a possible cause for bed of a confusion here um\nThere are issues however when you try to appropriate culture\nOr when you try to reach into some other uh cultural group and and and speak to them sometimes there are issues there's a case it is that the media is like ... is is like liking to highlight today\nAre and it's it's a commercial run on behalf of a congressman in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all\nAlthough surely if you watch CNN Today he will be\nYou know blame for it to ... to ... hours uh it's just some unrelated group running an ad in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance law situation um where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum\nWhich is completely unconstitutional to have in this country or when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on the behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is an ad being run in Arkansas\nIt's a it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your column whether you can detect anything seems a little odd here I'm here as the ad from the group supporting French ...\nWhy do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may bring and the Republican noticed dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me if the Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no operation and witnesses including\n... founders when white\nAre meeting in black poker game turnout outweighs told my son don't mess around with that if you get she will crime rate\nTo keep Congress let fame chair and the Republican because\nHave to protect our men and boys we\nAfford to live in white Democrat take us back to the bad old days of rain Bertie life Tetris is Atlanta\nAnd what our white girls going through right paid for by black Americans\nFrom the president's out into not authorized by any candidate for candidates committee first of all I Would normally watch a show with ... and you know this sounds fantastic and these are obviously ... they're making yeah right like the point of it and it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that\nYou know we one of the biggest reasons Beto is in a in the public eye in in the United states and not just a Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence they being shot in the streets for no reason because for for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with ... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man of rape and we're just supposed to believer\nThat is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race if a male but this is the type of thing that makes no sense I mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town go back to Emmett Till I mean this goes back to ...\nOn way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they didn't and entire communities wet and attacked the black person this is obviously going back quite a ways but it is something that legitimately as part of our history\nAnd it's surprising at least if liberals actually cared about black people and black men like they said that they do that they would want to embrace the standard like this so the point behind the at I think is\nIs relatively fair and it's something that should be communicated I think to the the African American community that ... that the criticism is perhaps a over done little of her done potentially the criticism here and interesting 'cause I don't think it's a\nIt's not it does not I don't know the ... the uh for sure on this but what I've ... my understanding is that these are the people who are recorded this are African American that there is not like a white person doing a black voice quote unquote\nHe's or African Americans are talking a and I guess the idea is that they have picked the stereotypical African Americans to do the commercial it's very uncomfortable\nOr I don't think that this is something that French ill necessarily even bracing or by any means but it is a something that's making a lot of uh\nA lot of waves in the media because they're trying to make it seemed like well this is just this Republican and who was a racist\nI mean hey he didn't have anything to do with the ad but\nBesides that or is it it's an interesting\nDouble standards that we find ourselves dealing with the always yeah and and we get that double standard in uh to the tenth power and you know I guess we get kind of used to it by now I'm just sort of used to the double standard and to the point where you almost feel silly bringing out the double standard\nIt happens so much it is and it but it's so obvious sometimes you have to for example does anyone I mean if you don't live in French hills district you know French Hill is is not a major if I actually don't yeah

this is one we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator\nAnd there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances with the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far left\nFigures and good for North Dakota for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah\nLooks that way yeah yeah there's some uh optimistic things there but the dangers there as well I mean this is going to be an interesting one and ... and the thing that's really unfortunate is if if\nThat happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now which is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly you lose it let's say\nEight or ten a seat you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and I think there's going to be almost nothing they can get through\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which still find ways to get those there I'm sure of it\nBut other than that you're gonna get any real advantage not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to have tough times with any regulation\nYou're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy as long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah just just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah uh yeah not a problem to show you the house at how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're going to say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know what this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing 'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats\nNow it's a point one percent chance to really unlikely like you say that that an absolute no what's that going to get to eighty three right ... ... the models are also showing there's a point one chance for Republicans to hold the same amount of seats they have now\nIt's that bad and environment at the same same percentage chance the the crazy outlier possibility is Democrats plus eighty three Republicans pluses zero what is the chance of\nNot holding the same amount of seats by keeping the majority about twenty percent they're saying about uh twenty percent chance they can keep the majority right now wow ... ... about the same percentage chance that Democrats can get to set it\n[laughter] so I mean look and if they get the house if she doesn't have all the Democrats do is get the house they're gonna be able to launch investigations like crazy right\nThey are going to it's going to be a nightmare almost certainly impeach a relative each in right now we're going to be convicted no no the when I won't be no chance of ... unless something dramatic were to happen right because you have to get to is it sixty seven seats pay another step better than I Know in the sixties seventies and they're not gonna get anywhere close to that even if they get the majority in the Senate they're not going to be able to do that\nBut they will have a subpoena power\nThey will they will bogged down the administration in constant investigations and look investigating something that's real it's fine\nWhat they are going to do is not ... it's going to be ridiculous they're going to investigate it'd be a nightmare you know there's a new story up today that Ivanka Trump may have committed a crime if you've heard this no\nBecause when she was promoting the sale of real estate or in a when she was back in the day and you know do her job was with the Trump Organization see she said things like wow this is well this one's almost sold out\nAnd it was not almost sold out like were they saying like our new building in a in in New York or you should get it now because it's almost sold out and in reality was only like twenty percent sold out\nNow look there's an organized the gate to be made right like you shouldn't say that because if someone's investing it I'll probably do the investigation and these wind up going bankrupt their ... your man you joke it's happening [laughter] believe it I Believe there is a huge report that came out from a left wing media sources should be going on in New York has investigated them a bunch of times already\nBigotry when we walk\nCounty there rock and roll lovers is Sandy West and I'm here to take you on a trip back to this week in rock and roll history but it's often Nineteen\nFifty one

fair\nAmount of you're still on the you're still going to win on the on the ballot they have to put a red where there has to put a sign up where in the voting call ... ... but he was still on the ballot but he's dead he's still on a belt but he's dead but people are still\nKnow if he wins or who serves they will nominate a Republican to replace them I guess so this is your weight and this has happened in previous races as well where or candidate passes away and then people still play them wasn't that Missouri where there had died and his wife yeah\nA served in his dad yeah yeah so I mean that's all they will be one of his hookers though it will be someone else you know we don't know what do we do business partner or you know ... yeah uh [laughter] could be I don't know who knows\nIt could be I mean we don't know how many Republican hookers he has it could be on Libya high percentage we don't know we don't know [laughter] I find out but I think I got to be interesting you voted for someone who's who's dead and and the NFL self described hemp [laughter]\nOh yeah that was the I mean it was that was the deal that Republican worlds 'cause he's ... he's a Republican big a big ... he rewrite and one other time in almost won the last time and he's actually going to what it looks like\nWell I'm I noticed that you're still talking about Glenn and his canoe trip but I look for the go pro video online and\nWhy did you did you check the dark Web it's on the dark Web no yeah that's weird oh yeah oh\nUh it's interesting because we I just got an email here it says ah this is the stew and pat I may be your only listener who's actually staring at the Mediterranean Sea as I listen [laughter]\nI can ... the Glen is nowhere to be seen rowing near\nMount the oh okay I Will anyway that was his departure pulled out to where he left from there so he'd be a long way from there are no yeah yeah oh you're not to be able to see him\nCompany ocean good to be there a while yesterday or the day before probably yeah they're yeah I'll be back on Monday though we think well he's he he he's already done the canoe thing across the Mediterranean and now he is a he was climbing a cake too\nAs we speak and all that training is done is paying off man it's paying off it sure is ... and you can tell when you look at him\nBy the way it was a lot of us that work out like that\nNow they are when you're you're ... you're put you guys in the same category [laughter]\n\nSo do the effort [laughter] good news good news coming I Know that uh you know everybody was concerned about a a carbon taxes but they're going to be here the Exxon Mobil is announced that they're going to give a million dollars to the Americans for carbon dividends and that means that uh the carbon carbon taxes on its way\nCan hang on Exxon Mobil is doing this that's where they're giving their but on the leaf [laughter] why are they why are they ... like the ...\nNow there's some belief that actually caving we're just giving ... million to pretend like they're four and they're not really so so that's very possible and so I was the lead to\nGet people off their back and get nobody off your back they know disbelief then you're ... you're just re ... just said they were faking it yes I think ... you don't get the credit for this and of course you know it is an interesting thing\nWhen it comes to a new government regulation all these companies that go through and and want free enterprise when they're coming up in the world right when they get to be the biggest boys they lying some of these new taxes regularly do because it winds up punishing upstart competitors\nYou know Exxon can swallow a little bit a strip of regulation and not not deal with it\nIt's like Google writes things you know they're they're heavily involved in in a lot of the net neutrality stuff and I got her Google ... like they can take a little bit of it they can deal with it in it you know if the guy down who's starting up something new that winds up getting punished\nBut listen we all I think we all can agree that something has to be done because uh now\nWhat what we cannot ... of the things that they're going to try it or not it will share the latest report from the guy who used to see us as a share of low carbon energy that we used to power transportation will need to rise from five percent or twenty five percent to forty five percent\nIn twenty fifty just to keep global warming to two degrees centigrade\nYeah something has to be done Mm right\nYeah well the ... the world has had a really rough run of it in that first degree\n[laughter] I mean I'm ... years she\nWell that disaster for humanity to get out it it's almost killed everyone on the planet oh my gosh now sure the the population has exploded a medical advances have exploded civilization has been spread throughout the world to be a poverty just in the past Twenty years has dropped by hundreds of millions if not billions\nOr even tens of thousands of kids who normally would die just a couple of decades ago now live but\nLet's complain about that time but what about the ice caps though what about the polar ice caps yeah why are they going to a good point why are they going I think if you are they completely gone if you're writing the story of the ... century where you're going to write about number one is going to be that you know the point seven degree temperature rise and number two is going to be the you know point one\nOf a ... millimeter sea prize or whatever it is\nA per decade over the past hundred years because sea level rise is the thing that defines the last century yeah everyone's like oh my gosh and I remember when\nThere are a bunch of states to the west to South Carolina in North Carolina to remember that now they're all under water that's what everyone will talk about when talking about the ... century now the wonderful advancements\nIn going back to you know a to a ... Exxon giving their million and still not being enough it's never enough right I mean at least companies it's never enough they'd given we have the story about clean next rebranding their man sized issues\nBecause of the gender backlash yeah ... what did they do um the weather's been many people have complained meant including the story and from a Cumberland clerk who is the maker of Kleenex um", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "20"}
