H. U. T. H. and she had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ss gorge did and she terrorized women are and participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress\nAnd went to work and

southern Germany\nOr he was focused on style and under Soviet Union is expansion so the United states was in track and these people at all\nAnd they just got out and mass most of them went to South America where they had to be tracked down and how they were tracked down is just an amazing read\nIt really is it really is great great job on this one was what was the research like on this

everything over lobbing verbal bombs at our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out or you know I kinda I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend ... and I'm perfectly fine\nBeing a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I had a doctor or a diver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had David Reuben who else a stew here recently Michael wrecking walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything [laughter] but\nI'm looking for the people who you can't have\nA conversation with somebody who is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress there is\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal in a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy of somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know liberal is somebody that wants government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it's it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are though outside outside of\nThe media Rena I agree that there are you know people\nPeople think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't\nTalk ... she has no interest in she has no interest he wants to end you want to share a country where the best\nIt's the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two and\nRoe v Wade happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex peak heat and want to be a kid in the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than men for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed we wouldn't bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten the way of everything funny things happened the last few years though guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all or England or I Can't I Can't and ... do you watch a never\nEnding up when I'm On the year ... India and unless that\nStatus and hang on just a second I Want the audience to know that's unheard of in our business that you could not have done this ... without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go viral and social media to long form it's just toxic ingestion and that the vast yeah yeah my mom watches a lot more of this she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away while I'm and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine whites Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be provided things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fine if we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with\nThat ... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like we're not communists right\nAnd so we have we have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is to provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I've worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement other than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers that GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this has filtered down into the talking points we in conservative media get from these people and that is that the ...\nRich GOP consultant believes American watch em wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and Gomorrah at the same time\nIt actually totally and reverse the majority of it and and you know it's fascinating is Putin a huge study on this\nBreaking it down into twenty sixteen electorate at the bit libertarian the myth of the libertarian voter minutes how they define them that that voter largely does not exist at the unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to your the party of big business who wants to leave me off and doesn't care about me guy just tend to one at minimum it's not even close and and the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate heat and dust\nAbsolutely embraces all of these cultural flashpoints he didn't say he

eating a chicken sandwich about mid August of two thousand and sixteenth or two thousand twelve\nChick fillet day he'd have been present United States but he won't even eat chicken sandwich every every moment Mitt Romney had a chance in that campaign to hunt on a cultural flashpoint he\nDid every moment John McCain had to hunt on a cultural flashpoint even lecturing guys like you about not using Rocco bomb Israel middle name remember those days and yet he punted on every one of those\nTrump said cultural flashpoints I'm aware I'm going to put it on my face marinate it and I'm going to bathe it whether I Believe any of this stuff or not I'm a businessman and I know when the market wants a product\nAnd I'm going to give it to them and you see the way that our base responded to that\nCase so let's talk about uh the of the result of that the good things and the bad things in what the Democrats are now saying and go back to the violin so they told you at the beginning of the

I asked the group\nIt\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they denied God three times in their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm and you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ...\nPeople don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive is him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nOn the table at the moment is or a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you write in but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our poll bits that\nHad decided they don't want to be the next ... show on cable news basically they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nAnd it's because they don't understand that progressive ism isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is a this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removes the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from a leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIt the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and became seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of ... ordinance say this okay say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes year where in ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor you're you're attacking their idol this was not mere political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement vicious religious fervor you're dealing with the elusive sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation dialing the understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] they couldn't short were\nThey translate that into human language\nAnd I I I think we see that with global warming with a with their reaction to abortion wear loose Robie weight thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things ... it it really is a religious fervor you know that you see with them\nAnd and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ...\nIs this is pale as his\nYeah they if they don't necessarily know or they don't know it but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children [laughter]\nHe wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permit skew is sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the groves in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby rose I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around\nI I think we do bad stuff because we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law\nUh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that with the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange the truth for a lie so there's one big macro truth in in the universe\nAnd there's a lot but there's lots of eyes rights are about supply so when you change that truth for a while you're given over to a database to mine and that's what you're talking about\nAnd I go back you know one of my favorite movie rants when I was a kid and it's probably a terribly placed analogy but Donald presence rant and the first Halloween movie about Michael Meyers can't be killed it can't be stopped that can't be reason with right when he's going off about him and when he was like in the insane asylum\nThat's what you're dealing with here there is no talking look at the guy who ... who kicked drop kick the woman in Canada when he's wearing a pen a gram around his neck you to go look at his picture closely okay I mean that's just self awareness is dead in your face kind of stuff look at the way he talks to her piece really polite he's asking her what she thinks\nHe's totally Lou city's not craze he not raving roving mob okay and then when she said when she when she refuses to about the same idol that he is all he is worshipping the total countenance changes and he dropped kicks or look at this her own a woman from Hawaii that's on TV all the time now\nI mean her account the way she looks she looks like when you take your bride to Hawaii for a vacation or a honeymoon and you get off the plane she there was a play the sweet rolls way to welcome you to the island seen this looks like the sweetest oh woman doesn't she\nThen she starts talking about politics mad and she opens her mouth and it's brutal vibe or stuff comes out yeah that is it does I this is this is a nuisance sanity that culture produce with my dollars\nFor ... I like I ... I feel like you know when you discover a new band and you get excited like the ... going to be amazing and like here in ... on an early that's how I feel with her own All right now yeah she's just starting to say these crazy things she's going to be a legend\nIn conservative talk radio yeah she is she can't help herself she doesn't seem to know what the lines are what you got to be our next Maxine Waters yeah and I'm excited about it yes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Omaha", "day": "13"}
