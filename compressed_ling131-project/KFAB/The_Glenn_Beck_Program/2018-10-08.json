didn't do it very well the last time it happened number two I think we're playing a team that much improved you know you watch the way that Nebraska has performed since the Michigan game and especially last week in Madison\nOr was a very impressive performance I think Adrian Martinez is going to be and already is what is going to be an outstanding football player but he he he's a magician right now I think he makes a lot of things happened uh he's very talented with his arm he's very obviously athletic and and makes a lot of guys miss\nAnd and very impressive to watch a you know and then ... them in a morgue and on the outside you know as we watch the tape\nAnd you know I think this is just as fast as a group as we've seen yet the season uh talked to was from a skill set and if you include Washington ... ... votes the same\nType of athleticism and speed so defense is going to have its hands full against another double eagle team or like we've seen in the past with their defense and I thought they they gave\nWisconsin ... a lot of issues they just ran out of gas a little bit there are in the second half defensively but\nA very impressed with the job that's gotten his staff are doing obviously changed your culture and you can see that this team has improved every week on a credit goes to their guys to their to their staff so we'll have our hands full with author guys will handle success well prepare the right way\nThis one of the best badgers ever on the field I'm a longtime coach now or ... or ... or the Wildcats up after a great line by that all American background and Rosemary early night yeah um [noise]\nThis is an interesting program this is a program that expected to be five an hour right now are coming into the season they were saying this is it we have what we want on the interior lines on both sides are we have a quarterback that's going to be in the NFL we have an outstanding running back\nAnd they have not played very well uh they didn't play particularly well against Michigan State they only had eight yards rushing I think\nUh so I'm not sure what to expect out of these guys that are you know that they're smart and you know that they don't make mistakes but they've had breakdowns they'd been thrown around a little bit by teams uh they got beat a early in the season by Duke\nUh they they play pretty well against Purdue that's probably I'd say that's an even better when they're Michigan State when frankly but\nA based on what's happened I think produces a better football team to Michigan State\nSo I'm not sure what's going to happen on Saturday are we going to have a northwest are deemed it finally puts it altogether and does what they are expected to do although they have head injuries and Clayton tourists and has been okay to good coming off his injury but he has not been as expected they thought he'd be it all began caliber quarterback\nSo we'll see a they don't have super athletes but they run great routes they make the catch they make the block they make the tackle a they cover kicks they do what you're supposed to do and if that happens against Nebraska the huskies are going to have to play a clean game otherwise you're gonna have a problem\nAnd this is the thing you're right this is the thing uh I think that that Oscar fans are waiting to see what\nEven against a really good opponent what does this team do if it doesn't have a hundred yards and penalties that crucial types uh I'd say that look that Wisconsin game could have had a completely different complex and I don't see\nI Know that's when when when the Thomas goes for whatever the name of a tailor yeah it is that all of them like rosier Jalaluddin ADA yards a that was pretty much the the dagger a but it wasn't a band that that wouldn't ... we'd have more points going into that I'm just saying if this team offensively\nParticularly to knock it off with the penalties and kill a crucial drives you got different looking ballgames\nPerhaps um and I think yeah there were a couple of that that flag\nThe targeting call was just are you kidding me you know we gotta targeting hall and a guy but we somebody back we'll\nHold and and that essentially a disrupted that whole thirty three are play up and then the Fifteen yards would have been tacked on after it sure that was big but you know every game has those moments and\nYou know a lot of the ... were were ... they are naturally optimistic people and I'm a naturally optimistic guy and I think most Nebraska's if you live in this day with the weather we have you better be glass half full you're going to be miserable and I think most Nebraska or glass half full people but\nYou know you go back to produce game produce drops six passes in that game that could have easily they could have loaded up sixty honest they don't drop I mean those are drops those are in the guy's hands are so we tend to ignore that and say well we hadn't committed these penalties and this this is okay you're right but\nI find that at the end of every football she's on or they passed but I'm Talking about at the end of every football season you're typically going to have about as many good things go for us go right again right so you know what if we just had this but then again if they hadn't had that we didn't\nSo I'd rather well you're not you're not going to sit there and argue that that self inflicted wounds are really no but I'm telling you there were other plays that weren't made by the other team that had they made those blaze than the uh the concept of their victory may have been very different to cause they and all I'm saying is that I\nI'm One of these guys were on Fox okay we're on fire that any changes so how do we find a way to do go want to be one of them yeah how do we what are we doing up those guys are what are we going to do because I don't think there's any doubt unless there is a massive breakdown\nI don't think there's any doubt Nebraska is going to move the football on Saturday or to stick in the they can't they can't handle JDs the Olympic not gonna be able to handle Murray's wash in and out of the back really sure if that can handle a dreamer Dana's them see anybody like all year All right\nSo we're going to move that unless there is a huge breakdown on the office of line or they do something strategically in this game defensively to we're not ready\nTo handle it start drawing laundry on his right and left like a you know what they had a ... we largely deserved I'm a I'm not arguing that I just got to stop that\nSo I think we're going to move the football\nI think we're going to put points on the board but they're going to take they're going to slow this game down they're going to take their time they're going to huddle up before every play they're going to run that ... and are we going to be able to stop\n'em and we can't say that's like why is that right there but it's just it's it's as some game here\nYeah uh and I'm hopeful that we're going to come up with some of the black church that that they can they can really truly hanging their helmets on and say we're going to do this on Saturday and it's gonna work\nRose asked the question when we were promoting our show tonight what would you do or if you're a Scott for us today on five\nIn terms of not only access and I was um but I\nTo believe personally but he's taking care of business in terms of\nOf the psychological department I think I think these guys respect that the end of the temp power with his ah he ... he takes politics out of your play better you when you try hard we're not gonna holler out you\nAre but what would you do on either of those fronts if you're Scott process or phones are open you asked by by eleven ten\nA toll free outside the home on metro eight hundred five four three\nYeah we're going to hear from a more from process when we come right back on this Monday Night\nSome of my Monday Night could've mind if I find that you're my son used radio eleven ten K. F. A. B.\nI just I'm just curious 'cause I think everything I've seen and heard a Scott for us that these are stellar guys and we know about the advantages of having an ... for sure yeah but I mean he's Scott thanks a world of these guys are his team and he believes a is it possible\nYou've got some elements of this stuff that we're perfectly suited\nTo that kind of football as they played down the central Florida in that conference\nAre and are having real issues adjusting up here and the ... and the and the key will be whether they can overtime make that adjustment because I mean we saw track because everybody was interested in central Florida those last three or four games they played last year it looked like a freaking basketball game [noise] uh [noise]\nDon't know Garry I think only time is going to tell us that I have to believe\nThat there will be a little bit of an adjustment and the approach and\nYou know when Scott was pretty brazen during the news conference in ... he said oh the victims gonna change does see that's just a little out there uh when you consider urban Meyer ... that was nice to hear like the ... ... okay it's nice to hear but as a man as as a as a\nBody of practicality it might have been suffered the little premature a couple of years and that bill moose pops offices right now Ruben Meyer and Jim Harbaugh worried on unleaded okay that's all nice that's all good ear candy in the far right but it's probably not healthy for your brand and that's doing stuff winds up on bulletin boards uh\nI Do think this I think Scott Ross knows exactly what it takes to build a champion at the ... I think this guy is one of the smartest guys that's the Nebraska is ever coached he doesn't have the education of the time I was born has but he has\nIn the insane smarts about football and about players in about little things that matter I put him in the category of a bill Snyder that way you know for a so I have great faith in him I think he knows that this is what it's going to take and if any of his staff members are up to it either they don't believe\nDeep down inside what needs to change here from Nebraska to get back into the top ten\nOr they can't do it which is not a character flaw here on while then he'll make a change 'cause this matters to him now this is not a job this is his life location or a and so I have great faith and confidence and that part of it or I were only going to know and two years but I I Am a little worried\nA but not overly so because again I Am going to defer to this guy because he knows but\nI don't believe you can sustain a program with a lot of junior college players I think you can sustain a program with a few the right ones you know two or three or four you know microbes ear olive on today David that's probably unfair because those guys are really good [noise]\nUh but I get a little nervous that okay we gotta get guys in here now well two years from now you don't pay a price for that yeah 'cause you're taken up high school a spot for junior college kid and sometimes it takes two years for ... to get where he needs to get he has to unload a lot of bad\nHabits that junior downright ... even for ... and ... and a technique for efficiencies not most of them are but um are in some cases are like I think I Will western would be one where they play a lot of great football but universally not sell a so we'll see a but he he knows that hey\nWhat I think would deep down inside really worry Scott and then and I'm just guessing because he and I haven't talked about\nThis if this thing really goes off a cliff this year and we finished with three wins you know a nine losses are heaven forbid to wins and losses\nThan the first months of next season becomes extremely important because then you're looking at losing people you're looking at ... wait a minute it's you know what\nI'm not a believer you're going to see a lot of people get really skeptical and they're going to start finding other things to do on Saturday I'm not saying that's going to happen but that might be a deep down worry which may\nDictate some of his recruiting moves this coming\nMonday Night quarterback show ... eleven tend to be rich right\nAre you guys well ad rich off of them got about a a a optimal\nA real quick I Want to comment on the fact that a lot of these players are on the team that are from a previous coaching staff I feel like you know and you got to have been put under off pretend to heart playing time\nThinking that they're going to start and that they're going to go out and be able to fill the problem with that is though if you're expecting anything\nLike that or you know deliver I feel like the coaching staff now doing a proper job of I'm kind of weeding out a little bit and how people are leaving based on how they feel personally about it and I don't really think that uh there's the heart going towards ... part of your house then by one day I'm pretty proud of the way the coaching a million now\nBack stretch I agree Steve you've got the last word you're on ...\nHello hey guys like hey I don't know how to couch fan but not that I'm having problems where\nUm I don't understand why we're going forward on fourth avenue for sex from our forty or fifty yard line or they're already I'm kind of wondering you know the Wisconsin again we're searching the three why don't we just hotter than just you know live dark day festival down\nInarguable point in your observation is dead on a that was a fifty fifty call and didn't work out first got here", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "08"}
