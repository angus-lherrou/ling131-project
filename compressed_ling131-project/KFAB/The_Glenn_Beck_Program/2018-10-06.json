hundred and fifty pounds and he plays tied into an offensive tackle they're actually from the same town as Bryce been heart who's another giant\n... who's you're pushing six nine three hundred and thirty pounds or whatever it is a so I mean that that those are two two young guys that I think you have to look for Tyler Miller\nOf six seven um two hundred and eighty pounds out of out of Iowa and that twenty twenty class Carson Lee out of that twenty twenty costs lots of linemen and I think\nThat it's pretty clear in Nebraska knows they have to rebuild up front and they they are doing a pretty

at a third party I Know you can have your opinions about their grade but they're not that far off they know what they're watching and\nA brass ... has not been consistent and tell me if I'm off on this statement when I look at how they want to do to the ... with the line they're going to use high miss and ... maybe ... or two\nThis year or two thousand Nineteen maybe two thousand twenty but then you get all these recruits coming and you get three or four high school guys in three or four more and they're just gonna keep building that up where when the time is right when a Haim is in a

the board in terms of guys on scholarship so that that puts it in perspective the amount of work that they really have to do and and and for this twenty Nineteen class you know they've got three guys committed a couple of high school offensive tackles and Michael in and Matthew Anderson and then obviously the Jew go a Desmond bland who's going to come in and play garter center\nBut I Do think that that you have to bring in a total of six and maybe even seven in this recruiting class to kind of recalibrate those numbers and and I think you have to be\nA probably a mixture of a couple of more do

with my daughter\nYeah right yes okay now\nLet's think about this ... you are because this is a senator Danes yeah promote Montana okay so senator Danes from Montana he's been elected by his people to represent them\nEat this is one of the most important in game changing votes a of maybe his lifetime\nOr it will if if the Republicans the Republicans lose this it will set the standard of how everything else goes from here it will teach the left you can do this to anybody ...\nHow do you just because my still would\nSay I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on do they still want to vote without his they may not or if they're at fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's less let let's play the game though yeah forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to be parents\nWell no well yeah I mean it but again let's say mentioned switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican so let's say ... signifies today that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he'd be changes that tomorrow\nSo it's instead it forty nine forty or not it's not a sure thing you need Danes\nI've got to say like my ... it's\nHard with your gun was title with my daughter but in ... and the end you you rethink that I had the other opposite thought which was my initial thought was this is really important\nI think if my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screw this country I Am there like that like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't but your family can that can be moved for instance if the vote is it\nYou know two o'clock a that is still what a\nMontana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started it six started at three and I'll be there\nAt the ... vote right like move the vote\nAnd that there are planning on doing by the way if they need Danes are going to delay the holy until he comes back oh Gees delayed the vote well only if they need them right now he doesn't look like they need him we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy thing to do you could just ... ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow it to no\nNo they can relate to the Sunday yeah or easily yeah or Monday but there's that risk of like you know some new accusations during the crazy thing that happens you know with the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding\nYeah I don't I Can't see myself missing my daughters had\nEither yeah a kid I mean that's your first responsibility your family you know so\nIf we're the ... values party right like if that's what we really are you know you'd have to understand that ...\nSo I mean I'm married in Montana yet and it would be really frustrating though if you lost that Supreme Court justice huh uh opening of a wedding [laughter] no way that that was my first I Would I mean like that it would be really if you lost that in a good Supreme Court justice over a wedding\nThat would be fresher that wedding changes would you want your wedding to be the thing that changed the course of American history I wouldn't do do\nYou almost want to delay your wedding yeah you'd be like dad go vote I don't want that responsibility on my back over our heads for the rest of our lives\nI think it was on friends but they say that I you know it's just basically just a party and the the the bride to be said if you say it's a party one more time you will not be invited by like it's not a party in really important and if you're a daughter and you're going through this\nYou gotta have your data he wants a Walker down the aisle and I mean there's nothing more you could say about we always talk about how these people are just like political robot\nThis is a real person with a real daughter with a real priority and in a way I really feel like wow that's amazing that he's willing to take that stand and this is\nBut here's the but here's the thing though also looking again from the daughters standpoint would you want your marriage to start\nThe calving off in one way or another\nKnown in this country should probably get death threats\nOh she probably would yeah it really ugly\nFor for the whole family that I don't think banana has police no third oh he's there is no real your from your from trees yes of Helena I've been to the main street oh my gosh so the layoff you got out they had like a taped do they have the the uh\nUh oxycontin problems that they have the heroin problem up and it's mostly math math yeah mostly math\nCrack and math yeah", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018",
