I put it into action myself in my own life and I've seen it work\nYou've done the same thing and you've seen this work with millennials talk about the millennials about\nMillennials right now I are one of the reasons we have a precarious or dangerous moment because we have two hundred and forty two years of being an American nation under the declaration three ... two hundred and thirty one in the constitution donations ever survive that long and so we just kind of think will always be here\nAnd yet at the same time you have fifty five hundred years of recorded history and there's never been a socialist nation that's increased ... freedom or increase prosperity and yet right now Seventy five percent of students in college support socialism bubble forms of government we cannot survive if that becomes the believe when they become leaders\nAre and and the same way for out of five millennials believe there is no absolute moral truth\nMan if we can agree that things like rape and murder wrong you get no chance for having a nation in the future you got fifty three percent of millennials who believe that free speech should be limited Nineteen percent who believe that violence is a riot response to ... to free speech you don't like you you can't survive as a nation so that's why we call it a bit curious moment but when you look at millennials\nThey are really um easy to change ... agree they're hungry if you if you create a relation and one on one relationship but they really don't care about your age they don't care about how you look at the care about whether you're sincere\nAnd if you are sincere and say and what we found works so well there's just asking questions because they really have had a low dumped on them by their professors and by the culture and they've not thought it through\nAnd when you start asking them questions and and not trying to win that's where I'm not trying to win just just thinking I just\nI just I that's an interesting thing let me ask you a question how does whatever villain the blank they start to engage and and they I find that they actually\nThey actually um\nBegin to move toward you faster\nAnd not not just blindly accepting things but because of them and asking them to think as long as you're not trying to win this right nobody does that that's right in college they're being told what to think join in chance to this\nAnd and if you have any other thoughts so when you challenge them\nThey actually like that it's the first time anyone has done it\nThey they really do respond to thinking well and what's it gets going there killer ... really\nI'm Sorry that's an old school all or you know I'm Sorry I was right I I Can't say that ... that it that out there that's right [laughter] but they really are and they're the most of all groups in polling for the hundred years have been no polling they're the most relational group\nIn American history was I mean they they respond more to relationships for example there are the only group\nIn polling that wants to spend more time with their boss everybody else wants to spend time with the ... and get away from boss or whatever they want time they want to be ... I mean they they they have a desire to spend one on one time with people who can influence them and help them and thanked them\nNow that's not necessarily their motivation but what is interesting is they respond really really well to that\nAnd so when you create a relationship that has a junior as you said that trying to win just a genuine relationship\nYou can make so much progress and turning

I made the debates are great they said look when we got here if we get voted we would have voted the way that we were thinking from the west indies and Ireland and elsewhere\nAnd pierce butler said you should not be allowed to vote until fourteen years here because you need to learn to think like in America\nOh my gosh with the Texas needs to do that with Californians always oh you're right ... ... ... I'm telling you were going to lose Texas because of the Californians they are just going to vote the way they voted out and we are not the same place that's what\nWe're not the same play and I and and they think like California right takes a while so Alexander Hamilton said five years and that's what they went with was five years but you could not vote in America until you've been here five years otherwise you would turn this place in wherever you just left\nNo anchor babies citizens goes citizenship goes from parents to child not to try not child's apparent wow\nSecurity risk can be deported and permanently banned from the United states the government must protect the borders during times of war states will have a definite role in immigration so that is what they that's what they did a ritual immigration law okay\nHow I found it fascinating and the book that we have\nArgued as if these things were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language how dare you insist as if this was just some idea that a bunch of racist had\nBeen Franklin is a great example because Ben Franklin talked about how so many Germans from moving into Pennsylvania and they were\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language their started create signs in German their truck started to create documents and German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing it\nSaid we have immigrants come into which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration\nThan in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separating from Great Britain because he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration it's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nYet simulation I mean ... Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in their early youth\nThese old principles with their language they will transmit to their children the proportion to their numbers they will share with us in legislation they will infuse it into their old spirit warp and biased it's directions and render it uh as heterogeneous incoherent and distracted\nMass he says the solution is thought better to discourage their settling together in large masses and they should distribute themselves sparsely among the native for a quick or assimilation\nThis goes right with with this it seems to me necessary this is Frank Clinton seems to be necessary to distribute the\nUm the German there's the Germans a more equally\nMix them in with English established English schools that are now where they are now to sickly settled I Am against the it I Am not against the admission of Germans in general for they have virtues their industry for ... the great farmers\nHe's just saying we have to get them to be Americans this is the opposite\nOf what we're doing now know Dearborn, Michigan I mean we we want people to simulate and we don't want them creating a parallel culture where almost a no go zone now for for police\nSomalians in in um Minnesota exactly\nAnd we got groups in West Texas creating their own separate communities and that's not it it's assimilation you want to become an American you don't come to America to take over and move to whatever your country was you come here to be an American\nNow that's where the professors the elite groups really are into all America's really bad ... you know we need we need to be like you or for whatever\nOne way to lose it is is not pay attention to what they did and one of the things we try to do in the book is we know we're not into government solutions we tried to give things that every single individual can do because America gets healthy from the bottom up not the top down you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd friends might just be [noise] ... out there

suspect been\nIf I'm not mistaken was it a few days or was it a year or after nine eleven\nThe original writing well the original time they they went to the next day\nOkay so the next day they asked\nAll right out exactly where they were what happened ten years later some of them said I don't know why I even wrote that this is a lie this is not what happened and I I don't know why I was lying then and they were convinced somehow or another they made something up that was different than what they knew to be true now\nYeah people ... what are the most important things that memory researches will tell you is you cannot confused confidence with accuracy in other words the fact that I Am absolutely certain that\nWhat happens is that what happened happened is not a reliable guide to its accuracy um so you can't ... so I Am convinced that my friend Bruce on the first day that should that does not mean it's more likely to be true that if I said\nYou know if I if I expressed it with more doubt um so I think what it is a lot of what this the lesson of all this is is that we just need to approach\nOur memories and not just our ... our entire lives with a lot more humility\nUm you can't\nReally we're not ... our our brains are not Superman [laughter] they don't they're not we don't have a video of quarter up they're taking out everything perfectly you know and we need to\nWhen I say I remember something one way I Need to be a need to check it ain't to talk to others I Need to be open to the possibility I might be wrong I Need to that's why we have\nLegal systems

I'm ... years and years and years of journals and she was talking about what that means for\nWhen you have a contemporaneous account of\nOf your life your feelings your actions your interpretations of what you've done you couldn't go back and\n... it is obviously serves a function far greater than simply checking your memory yeah but it's a way of keeping yourself on is what I loved it thought that was that that notion of if we live in such a kind of difficult and flawed world than we have to take\nResponsibility for our own stories\nAnd that to me what is what the\nUm what what that tradition of keeping a journal is about it as as a human being you have a responsibility to your self and to others to to understand the road that you have taken write and write it down so that when you twenty\nSay that you can look back and he said I I I had forgotten I did this then you know maybe I regret it now it may be able to get from it but that\nThat to me I just thought that was lovely I really did I thought that was a as an example of a kind of a a a practice um and you will you know obviously know much about this than I Do but they the idea that that is part of what it means to be\nA righteous actor in the world is to take care history seriously\nHave you heard from Brian Williams sincere podcast\nNo [laughter] I have I threw out one day I'll read it read it yet and I mean ... can you can't be can't publically say that's true that's great but you know ...

conferences coming up this morning or how to move in the Gulf Coast going after limited time and and the six previous uh investigations that actually something might have been in there\nI Know I Know you think it's going to have any traction or do you like or cast in Holland and no have I haven't mansion\nAh going to have like it's not going to have any traction it's not going to have any traction they'll polls are all moving towards Kevin I'm In the behavior of the Democrats has has actually gone against them\nBecause the Republicans played this right\nBecause they remained calm cool collected\nThey treated the witness with respect when it was an FBI deal everybody thought it wasn't but one other guy stood up and said I think we should have seven days okay we'll have seven days well I Want the FBI not to be told what okay they can do any way they want\nWell they like to expand it okay they can expand it\nWell there you go what what are you going to do they they the ... the Republicans have played this exactly the right way calmly and Cooley and a openly and now all they have to do is just say enough is enough\nAnd the American people are going to put a put that is a a a a marked for the Republicans I really believe that and I think\nSome of the hey hey Glenn do you think some of the Democrat Senator and you know like match and oil and gas states do you think they're gonna I sure will or just to save their you know say their cells\nCome over to the cabin outside yeah yeah I I think they will I mean I don't know what's in the FBI report but assuming that there is nothing new in the FBI report and you know this this whole argument of why they didn't talk to her well no we ... seats they interviewed her\nFor three hours what did she have anything else to say what what are you talking about uh so I I think if I were mansion I think still you'd be better at this you think those guys are going to cross\nA I think they probably will um\nBecause of their own personal interest\nAnd I and I think the party will actually lead to them or if it looks like it's going to pass they're going to let them because they care more about votes than they do about principles\nThe end of it and I you know I'd say that uh if you look at a predictor markets the highest percentage of likelihood is fifty three votes not not fifty one or fifty which would be the Republican but fifty three votes and I think you know mentioned in high camp or the two that are probably the most likely\nUm and and that's a big thing about if you're in West Virginia I Would love to understand that because here's a guy here the state that Trump won\nOver thirty points right I mean think about this squishy senators that you throw out there for public it's Orrin Hatch Mitch McConnell Lamar Alexander Lindsey Graham Bob Corker Jeff Flake John McCain when he was around Murkowski Susan Collins\nAll of those people vote with ah with Trump and the White House far more often not even close the closest one is Susan Collins and Eighteen percentage points she votes with Trump more than mansion\nYou want that guy in it representing you if you're in West Virginia and if he comes out today and and decide to go the the other way on Kavanaugh I mean he seems to be leading in the polls how is that possible was hurting\nBut this guy comes out and goes against Kavanaugh with

Kelly ... however you want to go a he's a part of the ... 'cause he's not from ...\nUh but that's the last time I think I'm ever ever say those words on this show Nate your thoughts first of all on how things play out what ties you all Lindsey I Know\nYou're very close with a lot of the guys and that group or new got to know very a lot of them so were you shocked number one and number two why\nWell no I wasn't totally shocked to see ... I'm leaving\nAnd there I mean there had been kind of some ... warning signs or some rumblings or whatever some talk about that possibly happening going back to the before the Purdue game even so I mean I think it was kind of coming off the Michigan performance um you know where he obviously had a very very rough day\nThat day um you know and and really I think he's kind of had a rough go the season so far obviously did not pan out the way that he had hoped for so far so\nUm it doesn't doesn't come as a huge surprise and and I think one thing that probably made this little bit easier for John is the fact that\nUm you know he's he's kind of a different guy is very he's very low key as very small circle of friends around him and\nAnd you know and then some of those friends that were the closest to him were the guys that are no longer with the program starting with a guy like he Shawn Johnson junior guy like person gebbia every Roberts um you know all those guys are are now out of the program and so\nAre his small circle got even smaller in\nI'm In I'm not necessarily saying that that he was you know part of the the termite problem or the ... problem that Scott Ross says alluded to or that he kind of set on on Monday I think it was a but at the same time you know he was never fully invested yeah I don't know I mean I don't know if you can say that he he really was so\nUm I I think with the new for for game rule\nOverlooks happy either I mean when you see 'em ... when you saw him every day in ... he just didn't look like you had enough on\nTight kind of ties John too I mean you you go back to I mean I can go all the way back to when he was a junior in high school every time I saw him it looked like he would rather be somewhere else than than where he was a even when he was a commitment or or I don't know if you can say committed and maybe a silent committed or whatever\nUh Nebraska is friday night lights camp uh when when they had all those all those caliber asking guys up here\nI mean he looked miserable out there but that's just so that was the way he kind of carried himself he never is the guy that really showed a whole lot of emotion and there's a lot of recruits like that you know some guys come in on their visits and they're all smiles ear to ear can't get that smile off their face and other guys look miserable they'd never crack a smile but that's just the way that he's wired\n... you go back to the very beginning of this Scott Frost era I mean there was\nA time zone I remember in the spring and the interview admitted that you know he was wavering a little bit if he wanted to stick around for this and F. essentially had to be convinced for the first work out you have to get it well then that was even rather work out like this was back when he was having a conversation with Stanley Morgan if they wanted to come back and if he ... he basically got talked into it\nOr by Stanley and then some of the other wide receivers to give it a shot and then\nThey go into that first off season winter conditioning work out and eat sense of the hospitals and ... my parents and the ... and so I mean literally that's like a a life threatening condition right off the bat that you know clearly he was not ready\nFor what those workouts where it never rained that hard yeah and so I mean things got off to a rough start from the very beginning and\nUh he said all the right things in the spring about you know buying in and you know looking at a fresh start and how we could fit in this off the off and\nAnd the coaches that all the same things that you know they really think he could flourish at that duck our role\nAnd then the never translate it uh you know he played sixty eight total snaps between often some special teams through four games or he was targeted um he had twelve catches Seventy six yards last year and then was targeted a only eight times in four games with ...\nAnd you say that long you have a return as one yard\nYeah with with him off to and so I mean basically a he was a non factor in times of liability in some cases and so I'm ... the coach is still thought that he had a bright future here but will will with what we saw or not only the first four games but uh the first ten months or so of this new coaching staff it just was not working in any sense\nYeah it just makes you think about that two thousand Seventeen recruiting class how many guys have left a lot of these caliber ask you guys are really only to\nYou know of the original California guys left mark held his music and he was up all the California guys a low profile they come a middle forced or or some but as far as his personality oh yeah he didn't really have much\nFan personality behind him or anything kept a low under the radar approach and then obviously the more Jackson is from northern California and he's kind of on thin ice right now but\nIt just makes you think about that whole era NATO and the time we spent the flights we've read all that time and ... ... maybe the ... I don't know what are they different agenda was sold to these guys and and they were maybe on board with that agenda before they clearly just weren't on board with obviously the things now and I think it's best for everybody\nYeah I mean honestly I have I have no idea if you can just put your finger on one exact reason why that never worked out um you know what I Do think that not all the kids have left the program or bad kids ah but for for whatever reason\nI Do think that it it was probably best for everybody that that a lot of these guys have parted ways with the program you know I don't know\nUm you know everyone's kind of got their own reasoning for for leaving here but\nUh at the end of the day you you have to have guys I Want to be here that are fully invested in what's going on and\nUm and obviously these guys we're not we're not caught you know all the way you invested in that and so\nUh it's it's good sometimes to start you know with a fresh slate and I know it sounds cliche to say but sometimes you you do have to kind of takes two steps back before he can take a step forward and it may be part of taking two steps back years it was kind of cleaning house a little\nBit you have a ...

Colorado in almost ... than\nWell I'll tell you Colorado had a freshman center a true freshman Centre an ad of one guard that according to our pro football focused ratings at Nebraska just absolutely destroyed that to interior guy interior guys and a lot of the Saxon the pressure we're coming up the middle I'm against Colorado way you know what the garden center area and\nI think when you kind of look at things gain by game Troy actually had a fairly good often says why that was their strength\nMichigan as we know how to you know a very formidable unit and a Purdue I I felt like it was David Blau David Blau was very slippery he was able to get away from a lot of pressure\nWell and you know I think there's some to be said for Colorado running a very similar off into what\nRascal defensive seen all off season so I mean they understood where they were supposed to hit their blitz is there wasn't any confusion there and you know when you're able to play without thinking you're going to be executed that type of levels so um there's a reason that the further they've gotten away from what the ... runs out of the worst those defense of results have been\nI think you could also make the case that maybe that was the most intense we've seen the defense play all season long to those guys were ready to roll and uh and I don't know if we've seen an effort or an intensity level they're really matches that Colorado ...\nYou're listening to the house Caroline show we're taking your questions in the mail bag with Oscar online intern grace Harmon\nHey what would you need to feed this we can just feel like the team has per ... per down\nI mean sure when would be huge I mean it'd be a big one of the biggest upsets we've seen um sides that Michigan State game um we're Nebraska is gone on the road as an you're twenty point dog but\nJust a semblance of that this is working that it's going in the right direction as Ryan Held set I clean game\nOr a game with very limited mistakes because Nebraska fans I think can handle losing but what they can handle is football one oh one mistakes and we're seeing a lot of those football one on one was a one on one mistakes that just\nReally you know make Oscar fans upset because they they have such a high football IQ level of what they're watching in in what they're watching right now is not satisfactory well\nYeah and that's where it comes down to just play good football don't commit ten penalties don't turn on the ball over\nA don't shake a punt for fourteen yarger muscle punter or give up the big return them in and just just find a way to play some consistently good sound football and the results will take care of themselves but until Nebraska figures out a way to stop shooting themselves in the foot\nEach and every possession or they're not going to make any progress so that's probably where it starts for me as far as what this team needs to do to get better stay out of your own way play good clean football and then you'll be stunned by how things change and the better for you are going forward\nI don't really think it goes much further beyond that than than staying out of your own way I Do think that\nWe saw a little bit of progress at least on the opposite side of the football last week you know the if if they win that game we're probably talking a lot more about the performance Adrian Martinez had and you know in putting up where it was a well over four hundred total yards\nA which was like a top ten for all time performance for a quarterback Nebraska as a true freshman I mean I think that if they win that game where where's that is getting a lot more run than than ah than it has a you know since then so stay out of the way it continue to progress offensively and and uh you know limit the turnovers and penalties\nSetting a scene in kind of like this do you think in a senior class still have the chance happy NFL Draft\nWell Stanley Morgan is an obvious one um after that I mean Tanner farmer in jail foster really don't meet the measure bulls for that next level that I mean I think if farmer goes pro it's going to be at the center uh but I think getting drafted as a center is really difficult so\nRight now how would the engine injury to mix Stoltenberg ... um I I think of the senior class I don't know if I'm wrong with this but I I only see one guy getting drafted that Stanley Morgan yeah um\nAnd you know maybe there's an outside shot of a a guy like a train Neal maybe um but I don't know I mean he he's a guy that really hasn't done much since uh a breakout year a couple of years ago so I I don't know I mean unless some guy finds a way to make a restaurant special teams I I don't see it either\nThan Jeremy James and all kinds of tackle that's currently committed to old miss an errand Beasley I'm a six one two hundred ... athlete who's committed the Tennessee any big takeaways you had from that group and maybe even some of the on officials that were at Lincoln last weekend well\nAs far as the officials go um you know one thing that was really interesting with all three of those guys was first and foremost they're all committed to somewhere I'll be right so newsrooms committed to Nebraska I'm James committed ... measly committed the tendency but they're all from\nGeorgia so they all kind of connected on that level of their parents all got along very well because they're all from Georgia as well and\nUm you know in their ... their travel for the most part was all they're all together pretty much the entire weekend uh from from the time they got here until the time they left\nAh I think James arrived a little earlier than the other two but\nFor the most part they were they they all had a bunch of in common so\nUm you know as far as flipping the a guy like Germany James at a position that the offensive tackle spot which Nebraska obviously definitely needs in this class um I think it's a possibility that that happens but\nIt's not going to be a slam dunk and and I think you could say the same for Arab easily you know in in his listed as six won two hundred on on his profile but I tell you what\nHe'd look there's a lot closer to six to about two twenty five in person than six one two hundred so um I I Know that he's very athletic kid that they would really really like to add to this class\nAs either an inside or outside linebacker um but again he's committed to Tennessee I'm you know the he has a good relationship with Germany Pruitt there who's who's a defensive minded head coach and so I think the the the possibility of flipping him while it exists it's going to be a little bit difficult but\nUm you know bottom line for quit new some is the so he didn't get a seat in a brass could get a win this weekend but\nUm he says he trusts the staff more now than ever before and and I think that is huge news because he could end up being one of the steel so this class\nA obviously a player at a position of need their ... you could either play corner or safety for the Oscars are but for him to come away and say you know what I'm completely done with recruiting I'm not taking any visits that in itself is huge news um you know you look at a lot of the unofficial visitors\nBoy there's a lineman up and down the the sidelines prior to that game against Purdue and they're all about six seven yeah and they're all the giants I'm On some of the younger guys I'm you know the ... out of out of el\n... mom going to let me hear about it so if you throw Haskell like Nebraska\nOkay ... a six eight two hundred and fifty pounds you know this is uh twenty Twenty one kid is just a sophomore um he's got a potential to be just an absolute monster down the road and and uh I've been able to see him play in person would not be ...",
