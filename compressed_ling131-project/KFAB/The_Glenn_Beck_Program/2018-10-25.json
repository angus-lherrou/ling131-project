F. A. B. [noise] tracking\nI'm absolutely appalled by the coverage on this story because there's so much and that central nation being spread on and which I should at times case in particular and Adamy very much guys determining gender I mean nowadays\nGender is seen as sort of as free floating nebulous concept that is completely divorced from biology but it's very much a link to biology\nAnd anatomy and Ninety nine percent of that are biological ... is our gender and of course that's not the case with everybody but the vast majority of us that is the case and I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that\nSo so wait a minute so so hang on but\nThe times article was saying is that gender happens and\nI Am willing to go back to the you know a definition male born this way female born this way you want to say gender is male or female specific but I'm also willing to say OK gender is this the traits but it is not to biological I mean will they go that far\nHowever ... ... what what's happening here is um they're they're taking away sex and tying it to gender\nAnd so why would we have why would we have male and female sex if it's all gender if it means the same if it means the same thing it doesn't talk about trade the other part is\nIsn't that gender ... if it is all happening in your head\nThen that's just for you is it not\nA hail you're saying well\nI think nowadays people tend to use the gender across the board one because they don't want to eat like ... maybe that makes my comfortable and I think also from an ideological perspective and makes it easier for people to argue that that you can identify it whatever you want because it's a little bit tricky here I think lots of people still have the\nEconomy change to know that biological sex isn't it all out\nTo argue shall I say something like transgender rights it becomes helpful for them to say well maybe it's not about ... allergy it's about gender which is you know they say it's a social construct or whatever it is and that it makes it a little bit easier to argue that OK sound like do I sound like fail may not necessarily the link to\nTheir biology not sure if that really speaks to the point you're making\nSo but it was can you explain what gender does for a ... is\nRight so the feeling that someone else more alignment with the opposite sex than their first set suddenly or nail that they feel more at do they fit in the female\nOkay how has gender just for a a Ben embraced is gender just for a a a good thing or a bad thing\n\nI I think it's seen as I don't think it's anything are as good or bad I think a medical condition and I think people who are suffering should be able to have access to care\nAnd I think adults shouldn't be allowed to transition if that's the best approach for them but I think nowadays it's kinda glamorize and seen as something that is really I'm almost ... society\nBut it's almost like stand up positive thing especially among progressive\nTo one am that he'll know on downtown drawn to the analogy of Haiti dot com it's a dead man party resented by what House Chrysler dodge ... have you done when you are ...\nMaybe it's easy to save on steel as quick shops because every time he shot that bakers you're racking up ... points on your plus card fill up today at quake shop and save up to a dollar per gallon by using your plus hartfield points count on quick stop to have what you need when he needed and even better you can still use your bakers plus card to\nSave money every time you feel that the savings add\nUp to a dollar a gallon\nFor food and fuel year one stop should always be quick shop of course\nWe just we walk\nEvery rock and roll over is is Sandy ... let's take a trip back to this week in rock and roll history\nAs we can Nineteen Seventy five Paul Simon issues his fourth solo album still crazy after all these years gone it last fifty ways to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U.

Hillary's went up\nThat she opened up a very large lead and that lead\nTrickle down down down down down until the ... the very end they went from about eight or nine points right after that tape all the way down to about two two and a half points which is where the national polls ended up with the Clinton up about two two and a half points about um so the idea\nHere is Kavanaugh gives them this nice bump and then it said before the election and the Democrats are able at the last second to cross the finish line ahead there you know some of the polling is is somewhat interesting on this if you look at a recent polling um they came out\nWith the most recent poll from um the cruise O'Rourke a race now ... there's been a couple of polls taken over the past week or so that have put Cruz only up four or five\nOr there was holding their was seven and nine and ten and twelve point leads for cruise the past few polls have been more like four and five point leads for starting to turn the other way which is the last thing you want if tightening Mario and that was one of the arguments are Sean Spicer was making ashtrays really got to watch the trends which where these things are going\nNow I think there was evidence you know there is evidence I think that uh you know the\nPictures mix we don't know this is one race there was some polling though that showed in Florida as well a pretty decent pulling for Democrats in the Senate that came out yesterday with no set up by for ... uh there was\nA you know I'm the same plane though I mean Menendez of New Jersey\nNow again once again look vulnerable after it seemed like he had re open up a lead and maybe he would cruise to the finish line he's now only up by three and a poll that just came out\nAnd you know you never id you could fool yourself as a Republican thinking going to win a lot of New Jersey racist but it does I mean Chris Christie was governor there for two terms of just casually happened\nA ... it's a terrible candidate who you know quite quite likely was paying underage prostitutes for sex that he was not able to convict over ... to ... uh well do you judge whether you think that's a good or bad today but it seemed like it occurred\nUh so I didn't polling pretty mixed right now there was another fall by the way I'm In the you know um some polls are showing that Cruz ... race even tighter so I\nDon't know I mean it it was interesting to hear Sean Spicer talked about it because Spicer as you would know is that you know it was the original spokesperson for Donald Trump\nTo feel happy about the way you were treated that's why they say it said Dylan Buick GMC in Fremont it's fun to save money\nAnd it's great to be treated with respect to have all your questions answered from the sales for the service

I Would take the money and run\nBecause I don't know if that things are going to sit around for twenty more years gun Dell puzzle what could happen in Twenty years yeah I'm however\nTwenty two million dollars a year ear live in white lard\nAnd I will say to actually has a ... ah I'm noticing there's a note at the top of this was his originally written for a previous story they just updated it to hit so the twenty two point six million was on a seven hundred million dollar jackpot so we are talking more than double that you're probably about close to about fifty million per year you know our\n... your ...\nYour fight yeah take the ... it's funny hasn't the advice always been you you're an idiot if you take the annuity yes I'm this article goes through a and analyzes it and talks about how the tax benefits are there for you to take the annuity\nUm you're going to get a return that you can't necessarily get into bank account from the annuity and that's pre tax dollars if you build your only built one year her\nRight and you know they actually pointed out to a this is actually pretty funny article of this leads us to the biggest advantage of the annuity protecting you from yourself\nAgain I don't know all about you but I Do know you buy lottery tickets so let's consider the possibility that you were not one of your generation crate financial mind I'm ... and it goes on

mean you're not buying for you can't pay for them in cash and you know but you wouldn't want to have you have a guaranteed Twenty years of fifty million dollars why paying\nCash\nYeah I mean it seems like any bank is going to give you the low right just feels weird to pay someone interest on anything when you're in that financial decision but yeah I guess you could certainly get it\nWhat do you care or it's not going to be all that much I guess in the grand scheme of things about congratulations to uh whoever our South Carolina listener um who we of course made that incredible deal with to

spoken people at throwing bricks through our windshield of our car Roseanne followed it broke ...\nUh and uh you know stole everything that was in it\nWhat do people like you are sitting on a committee with Maxine Waters you have to have said to her have you've forgotten what happened at the baseball diamond or I mean have you said these things to her and how does she\nPond though I have said it to her and I said it to a lot of my ah those on\nOn the other side and and they don't respond\nThey just uh uh they just look at you I mean and and it's a shame and and the fact that matter is a\nA I guess they don't want to remember it but I Will tell you this about the baseball uh incident I travel all over the country and of course as you said earlier news cycle goes quick but\nThere's still people remember and come up to and Sam praying for you congressman I remember I was on that morning when I heard about it uh it it was a ... it was a moment that I don't think it's going to leave when the ... when it's a it's a moment that shows\nThough how low we've gone but when you mentioned it to to Maxine you mentioned it to\nSome of the others I had no response\nAt all and uh it's just moved on they just moved out we were just lucky or whatever and I'm a it's a it's a bad bad environment it's all generated I Believe from the dislike of this president Bangor I mean I'd rather the president failed in the country succeed\n... what do you say to people who would say well he is engaging in the same kind of rhetoric [noise]\nWell I mean I hear that too and and I guess I could say there's probably I don't agree with we all need to dial it down but\nUh I uh I I it's not right and and and and we just needed a it's it's just it land it's hard to say everybody in their heart needs to look at what we're going through right now it's not getting any better it's not getting more civil age who can do more to the other side\nAnd uh you know I I guess I Would say in my world it started the baseball field and I know who started that and what it wasn't it wasn't that it wouldn't have a a conservative on Republican shot start\nYou know right before the civil war um some there was a beat and with a cane by a by a a\nA a congressman and the well of the Senate and uh he almost died nobody they didn't they didn't even arrest the congressman nobody said anything about it uh and in fact\nThey they made little they took the pieces of wood and made little Keynes and they wore them around their neck as a as a badge of honor that you know don't mess with our party cars will beat you to death\nMhm uh I mean I I when I read that years ago I thought well we're a long way from civil war but I'm not sure we are that far from that kind of barbarism\nWell unfortunately instead of using canes we're using guns and uh you know I mean to go to a restaurant with your family and be yelled at to get on an airplane to go back to D.C or to come home and be yelled at ah\nWhat's that feeling oh it just a CNN says that's not a mob [laughter] well\nI'll tell you can have a mob of hundreds a model of millions of ... and ah you know from personal standpoint I mean I'm a former athlete I've got a lot of driving a a lot of fire but you know I have found myself just a given them my card and saying I Can't deal with your anger but if I can ever happy you know\nAnd uh but I mean it's restaurants airplanes it's being on the street uh it's it it's pretty unbelievable but it's way it is it's not getting any better and many of us now have been a half to have to have security uh and uh uh you know that's just another level of\nOf defense from from this attitude of a you know to heck with America let's go get them\nAnd uh if we put them I say if he put much effort into passing or not

shot at but I mean you know that I don't understand\nWhat the good they think that does anyway I think all it does is make people who are conservatives or Republicans that much more motivated to go

you are also the managing editor for faith wire dot com\nA and a and you've done some projects with us we have an upcoming project on\nIsrael but you are here to talk about a project that you're working on about pornography\nYeah we ah we've created a resource now because\nI'm you know this issue isn't going away and when you look at culture and you see how broken culture is that the number one area that it's broken in is in issues related to sex and sexuality and gender I mean we can't even look at people and say\nYou're a man or woman at the trigger some sort of reaction and everyone is up in arms about it and so you have a culture that's gone completely off the rails\nAnd so what we're doing is we've sort of press the reset button on that and we've sort of gone back to ground zero and how to God design sex how to God's design sexuality and\nAnd so where we zeroed in on was porn because we think corn is the main driver of that dysfunction that we're seeing in culture and the numbers are more staggering now than ever before\nAnd churches only nine percent of churches have actually resources dedicated to it so that's why we created a set free course dot com or so that people can go and and so that hopefully churches use it and and take a look at it and really it just presses the reset button on how God designed sex 'cause you know ... is a dirty word up than in some circles but\nUm and people sort of pushed that over but God created it you know God designed it for our benefit\nIt's really quite amazing we were watching something I don't remember what it was

doesn't take much\nApps\n\nAnd and the numbers bear this out I mean and even among Christians that's where the shocking thing it's like culture it's like everyone's got the rope or now I mean the numbers or eighty percent of people\nAll people have seen porn like you know an unfair especially from guys but Christians are not immune to this and so this ... this study from bar that came out recently sixty five percent two thirds of Christian men have viewed porn they viewed about at least monthly they admit to that so many things yeah thirds of Christian men\nAnd the porn is not like

that at some point the coyotes got to go this dam road runner keeps going getting away\nMaybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening\nVenus devices were not designed to kill but to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left\nI don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms no one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would\nBe funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who saw screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nHowever is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's a wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nSo he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a\nLeft wing guy or just a crazy person they will\nReport that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence\nNow you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the laughs narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue\nMany of our friends and the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked\nThat this kind of attack occurred one person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one\nTo deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was

don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on any saying everything is speculation\nAnd if I Would say Ari ... versus a left wing person trying to ramp everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening and they'd say\nOh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nAnd blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that [noise]\nAnd something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold

[noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous is this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of when I when we first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really I mean it's a plot you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the\nShrapnel is what's dangerous and a pipe bomb and explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need\n[laughter] [laughter]\nUm but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it um that they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again everything is spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is a you know and I've also spent some time in some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to them\nThe coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication levels for Asian\nBecause he had vent or or she by the way he or she had a sense um some of these bombs to home offices and and\nResidences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely be\nSchool until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and are fuzzy slippers with a
