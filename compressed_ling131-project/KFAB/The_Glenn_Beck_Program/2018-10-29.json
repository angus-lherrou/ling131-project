last week with\nPartial practice and only a half of play for the starting off and in the defense played no better half a two and a half quarter Saturday to at least starting group did and I'm now they're back to business that everybody knows\nHow to challenge they face this week and the talent and the coach on that side line so it was really not a lot but he said that they got all these guys are pretty good idea what they're walking\nIt's an intimidating atmosphere unlike Michigan which is the quietest hundred and four thousand people on the planet earth\nThey put a hundred and three

sixty six point one percent as a pastor and you know if it wasn't for the injury against Colorado and missing the choice game than having a play Michigan hurt you just wonder what what type of year he'd have right now\nI'm just because uh he he's not getting a lot of attention by many folks outside of Iraq because of the record of Nebraska but it's hard to find that true freshman quarterback that\nDone what he's done the last few weeks and then in his last for big and game\nHe's put up four hundred yards of total off and going back to the Purdue games on there is never going to

this kid have in front of a war hero or forty games in the Oscar stole a play and and he's already done all this and just as first seven games\nFor the better even better than that shot oh is\nIt you

that they have and here you have a dude\nThat simply Nate Stanley is a good solid hard hard working blue collar lunch pail quarterback but he's not an elite athlete and we saw that against Penn

you've been all intimidating\nNow a very rural yeah it's I understand one of the great venues but you take a look at the Iowa at Penn State of the day\nWas not only intimidating but it was it was effective that crowd and and and discombobulated Iowa when they were trying to operate their off at the end of the game\nAnd the conditions were really bad there it was cold rain innate Stanley injured his hand at some point in the game and he's had a real trouble completing very simple passes\nThey couldn't find no fan tell seemingly the fourth quarter which is stunning once ad is easily the best time in college football and that is not the most diverse office on earth so if you take away their basic run package that means he's got to deliver\nOn the five to Fifteen yard routes and that didn't happen nevertheless down the field they went\nAnd they were right there on the goal line but the chance to take the lead and then they had some miscommunication and\nA Stanley changed the play fad didn't get the change Stanley do the ball to the spot and the only guy either catch it was it at Penn State defensive back so I'd goes Iowa in a debilitating laws uh and certainly one from which they will have difficulty recovering or all of that\nAre really as a backdrop to the to another bad weekend for the western division Gary other than\nMinnesota in front of thirty thousand people uh [noise]\nYou know it was just it was one of those weeks you know were produced should have one and they didn't Iowa should have one and they didn't ah Wisconsin did not play very well um it just was ours last\nDuring lunch I Would love to see in northwestern now than a brass ... pretty much out of it yeah I Would let us into the western limited vision and go to big than the championship games\nA lot to like about that program and I like about a coach or they they don't cut corners on admissions so there is a small pool from which they can draw to get guys and they've just done a fabulous job\nAbout them rosy as you know what they could play the Pittsburgh Steelers this week and brown and I'll tell but next week I mean I don't because I Am it's unbelievable\nThat they just don't have the play makers and I don't know why that is I don't know why\nThey can get linemen and they can get ... and then get to safety is and then get quarterbacks but for some reason they can't get enough receivers and running backs\nOr or they they get one or two and then that guy gets injured and then they don't have anybody but they should start to recruit better because their facilities are so much better now than they were for years\nAnd I would suspect that they're never going to get a recruiting class ranked in the top thirty thirty five or forty but you know at the end of the year the game nine wins and maybe over you are so no doubt there just to be taken seriously as long as that Fitzgerald stays there um but in this case against Ohio State uh\nI've just anxious to see what we do that they don't ...\nI don't believe that Ohio State is as bad as running the football as they appeared to be against Purdue hard to believe a curb street who went to Ohio State and he was a high school a legend in Centerville, Ohio played for like ... among other people or he was just\nSort of biting Lee critical of them during that telecast and I think he was frustrated with urban Meyer is what is this game plan that you did you just got to check the ball down the field have another three and I'd give David Blau another possession and he'll take it down the field and score\nA Myers body language was screws very wide in that game and watching it I didn't look like he was healthy I there was an issue but\nAnd then if you look at the film of what happened in that game I went back and looked at highlights uh they're they're just not blocking very well there are offensive line is just it didn't block particularly well against Minnesota uh they they protected Haskins and he was able to throw the ball but\nThree or four well we call an hunter's op their guys that are bears some and cause the other team to be nervous when they're in the vicinity we don't really have that right now are we don't have somebody that plays like that right now it Charlie Hill and it would be very helpful\nTo shut out the next door and burgers back just in terms of even fresh surf big bodies there in the middle yeah um but I think you're right I think silly and you know last week it was remarkable fraternity been on the black shirt or you know he's got that he's got that thing\nA lot of the ... thing that you and they may I just love the guy and that was a leader they had then the intangibles with him or ride up there with some of our military can nearly type you know they're right up there I'm\nSo we'll see if if guys start playing a little bit better around them\nThat would be helpful or ... Bhutto was had good game and then there are times when he fled Mrs tackles he just does not tackled the guy and you can add that you look at Ohio State they didn't play very well against Purdue but when they are playing well\nYou get struck by then you go down there there is no yards after contact with them when they're really playing well they've lost a lot of guys of the draft early over the years these replace him with somebody just as physical and that's what the big\nTent at all of that and think well that's when a brass ... you know all those great years\nOkay somebody's out what guess who's coming in and you want to play against your own either Iowa Idaho Iowa played\nReally well the odds against Penn State Iowa's defense is if\nThey are good they are real and that's why that loss was so just sad for them and I know it's easy for us to do you treat them as a rival\nBut that was such a sad loss for them 'cause it was a tough game in tough conditions on the road they did what you're supposed to do to win a game on the road and and they blew up at the end\nWell um that's the game that's similar to a at Penn State but Ohio State one that you know I came away with a lost Ron you're on eleven doing good but it'd be Ron Hi\nHi how you doing guys good on Iran adult late\nLast time a chit chat but I'm just going to tell you my opinion I've been around one years old I used to what they are doing to come up the middle seat and all of\nA but any way or that I mean that old\n[laughter]\nBut they're two things I Would make sure of number one for Martinez so it was a kid got a chance to play number two the coach he's got to open up that playbook and hear how they can land\nStart running a lot of ... they call them trick play that statue of liberty was great when they run that gap to throw the path that would have been a cat but the receiver fell down I mean there's so many good trick played and I even seeing the pros I watched Minnesota last fight\nAgainst the sink and there were two or three trick played on both sides\nUh and I think that would be the difference I really do\nWell as tight ball game you're right I I can earn a living you can't make a living running trick plays you got to stay in your base office but you know Rob thanks for the call great to have your five five eight eleven ten one eight hundred five four three eleven ten if you'd like to be oh we've got a couple of lines open air a couple of minutes to go to the program [noise] sure", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "29"}
