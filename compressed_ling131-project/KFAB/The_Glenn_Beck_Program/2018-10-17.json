I'm Talking about your neighbors but the first thing we have to do is unite\nWith each other we have to unite to people people who are are on the right part of the spectrum need to come together we

we worth saving and I think the answer across the board I'll bet you eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving so what does that mean well capitalism\nCapitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution but we haven't been on the constitution or the bill of rights in a long time but we do need a rule of

it\nAnd I don't think they're wrong for thinking that it's the right thing\nBecause how is it right how is it wrong to stand up to bullies how's that wrong how is that wrong if the police won't stand up if the media won't stand up ... who's going to so I completely understand\nThat and I can't blame ya can't like I get it I just think it's not effective\nBecause what happens is the media event just takes the piece of the video that they have where somebody's swinging back and then they say it's their fault\nSo it's just not as effective do I want to get clubbed in the head no no\n\nBut if

mainly through social media so he has no conversation from the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming\nBut a analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time\nIncluding because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a\nPerformance in ... from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what\nWhat do those changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nOr that ... son ... and he posted online a while back a photo of him I'm next to Bannon and said that Bannon\nAs said he would be glad to help and the campaign or something like this at this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and\nWas responsible in a great part of a sudden out of strategy but a boat so NATO himself a came to a public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what we know for a fact\nIs that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ... an expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in\nThis direction and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have\nNo a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's get a presidential candidates son uh and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow but we don't know exactly at what point\nI'm Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth or will have the final result it's very likely the considering the current polls that bill so not a we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday\nWe had a recent poll that gave both so NATO fifty nine percent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one so it's a big difference and a ... a\nPoll after poll has indicated that uh his delight to our ferry sure of their votes so we we would have to have a a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario but\nUm it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and to find out some more we'll be following a thank you so much for appreciated okay thank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history or he has\nA he has a very very strong history\nOf um of dictatorship a love and passion and ah he is not a Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's changed man\nUh you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that is we should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world\nAnd he is a helping cobble together this a populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames and uh what are they what ... what will you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is the Patriot act\nMake it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with um because I'm In the rest of the world\nThe the believe it or not softness and a tempered dog\nWell Trump doesn't

I mean\nI think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with\nI mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then\nI remember there was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here\nIs that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist this that let's let's\nLet's clear that up this isn't is Saudi Arabia is really ... and it's not that they were killing him because he was a journalist but because of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood right I think\nI mean it's a you know it's literally impossible to be able to judge all the moving parts behind the scenes that we don't know about right and you know that's why you have this is why you hire a president that you trust and and you know this is why you vote right because it's the situations that we do this with Bush I mean\nYou you met with him during the war and he informed view of nothing a top secret or anything but a lot of the different uh things that you had to consider when making these decisions\nAnd you know it's easy to say well we should just never talk to Saudi Arabia again and throw them out there is a lot of things behind the scenes that they're doing for example helping in the fight against terrorism they've been a while obviously as we all know nine eleven or many of the people came from Saudi Arabia ... there's been all sorts of questions on that\nAnd we've talked about distancing ourselves for a long time and this is probably a great\nOpportunity to do that a little bit um but you know there's there have been they've also arrested and killed a lot of terrorists or that have assisted us over the years as well I'm a on those efforts so\nI it's a tough one I think you have to you have to send that signal you have to make sure I think probably sanctions or something if this is actually a proven um you have to you have to do something publicly but you look at I mean Russia's done terrible things like that and we have in uh\nWe haven't uh acted 'em any more about selling arms to Russia\nNo no it's not selling arms to Russia and you know the idea that OK well arms sales help jobs is not a great argument [laughter] this is the one thing that we have to we can't really consider the economy first when you're talking about arms sales yeah um but I yeah I think taking that step of of probably sanctions and maybe that's what it is maybe it's arms um\nIs this going to be an important really really important decision for us for the president Glenda [noise] um first I go back in history and I look at uh the Archduke Ferdinand\nThe barber who was arrested showed up wearing a\nT shirt that read I Would cuddle you so much harder oh boy Mary's eyes and this isn't that they went in as an undercover sting they thought no no just one of these idiots this house his explanation okay\nAnother guy [noise] uh\nLet's see if Florida else youth camp counselor\nAnd currently a maintenance work or a they'd been chatting with who they thought was a fourteen year old and they thought okay we're going to go meet up with a which is incredibly sick\nJames bowling thirty four years old owner of Bob's barber shop in Gainesville was arrested at race track gas station in deltona\nTold deputies that family came to the meeting place because he suspected that there was going to be an undercover skipping and he thought it would be cool to see it in action\nYeah so let me just tell you no matter what your challenges All right no matter what you're facing you're not one of seven men who are now arrested in jail because they were trying to hook up with a fourteen year old and you're not dumb enough to try to pass this off as an excuse of ...

the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though he was interrogated tortured and\nKilled he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\n... but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly\nOr last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead um but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Mick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation or torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if the Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance\nYou can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake I Can't imagine especially\nFully since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if it's if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the\nThe execution ers come in\nAnd the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... an conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this\nMay be an
