stickers on a car has anyone ever changed in opinion are considered a new one because someone not from one bumper sticker 'cause I think that's even possible\nBut maybe even a couple of maybe not going to write three you're pushing it you have\nA three hundred bumper stickers covering all of your windows you are not convincing anyone to your viewpoint I think you know those people because of it oh no if you have an ACOA\nYou're you're you're going to be kicked out yeah you're going to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof to death all of the neighbors even the navy\nYou
