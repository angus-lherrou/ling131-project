pause and they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where\nWe look at Canada and say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left\nPointing that out that we're calling

CEOs you know\nTravis Miller here's the c._e._o. of profile by Sanford was several locations around town Travis want to talk to you hear about not just who you are but what you do profile by saying for we always say we're\nNot a diet where a lifestyle change and we're on nutrition activity and lifestyle company people talk about weight loss and diet all the time and we really have an understanding that weight loss is a very difficult thing and it stems from places so most of our clients come from\nDoctors for friends and family and so you know anybody can sell a product we're not a product company we're short term lifestyle for people where the lifestyle of our program I should say\nWe don't want people to be coming back to a year after year after year we help them get the weight off really focus on lifestyle change behavior change and and they become self sustainable so the first phase is is really focused on weight loss behavior change non scale victory so we understand that everything's about weight\nBut victories in life whether it's new size ... pants or you know chasing after grandkids things like that second phase again behavior chain still focusing on that but we focus more on\nNutrition label reading how to differentiate foods out in the market and and helping people become self sustainable so drawing back some of those things that were in before and introducing new food and then the same face people are on their own they still have their coach to come back\nAnd visit with but they really learned that healthy lifestyle and and how to live on their own without\nBeing reliable I'm profile just got to be pretty rewarding work we always go back to the number of people attribute us first saving their lives are saving their marriage or what whatever that may be\nWe're really just providing the platform were there for the coaching it's really on our members to take it upon themselves to to make that change and go through that journey and changed your life\nAnd that's another CEO use you know thing for me you know hard in our community and thank you were listening to this hard Omaha radio station [noise]\nWhat else can your smart speaker for Nebraska news weather and traffic make sure you please and say play chaos baby on I ... radio\n\nThe ah migrants caravan\nIs coming our way to migrate caravan\nThat's not what this is ... ... if anything this is a humanitarian crisis because these people are being used they're being used by political operatives in Honduras Mike Lee a senator who was always standing guard by our constitution welcome to the program sir how are you\nDoing great thank\nYou very much good so you know I'm a you wrote to me last night it I'm not smart enough to understand it or you said there is a is there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department\nOf state chess and get a workout agreement with Mexico whereby a\nMexico would require people who enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people are from when the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed buddy\nYou refugees are arriving in Eu countries from Syria in other words when people were fleeing a a a country that's dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them or some particularly so that they have an asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum in the first country they reach it could be potentially save your that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum\nI thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy\nAnd apply for asylum I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\n[noise] [noise] yeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that you know in order to these people end up applying\nFor asylum with Mexico sort of going for the long ball ill Mary pass and tried to make it all the way to the United states but this jury is itself dangerous this journey that so\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited\nUh it it can exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and\nWomen many of whom are sexually assaulted during the ... and a lot of people claiming it\nTurn out not to be able to\nMake the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once they're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the asylum application if they're coming by land for Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I don't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a another potential magnet I agree for\nBringing people here um if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at just creates a whole lot of headaches for them\nIn the process so Mike I got a I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras\nSaid been following the news ah on the caravan here locally or been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud

Saturday against Minnesota\nAnd now they're home again here Saturday or this week against but then cook minute eleven AM game on the Big Ten network but\nAh let's first get to Saturday as we recap\nGot what we saw in and how that's carried over into the week for Nebraska number one Adrian Martinez guys twenty five twenty nine I'm his completion percentage now is near sixty seven percent over the last Twenty years in Nebraska football only one quarterback has had a better seizing the bleachers percentage and that quarterback was\nJack Taylor Scott from Joe ...\nJoe ... two thousand eight was in the sixty eight percent range I'm an only one of their quarterback has been in the sixties and that was Taylor Martinez for one of his season so we're watching right now uh with Adrian Martinez and what he's doing as a runner as a thrower the ability to read defense is\nYour weekend box office we view on high hard radio\nDown from Louisiana and what's doing just hid and we went from donating to the food bank\nIn eating in hunger is ... by feeding them that ... [noise]\nYou're listening to the husk or online show your authority on Nebraska\nAthletics yeah it's not ideal because we need to get ready for this game where you have protests game like any other and and we got to see ready to go play well\nIn the game but twelve weeks and rose to you you see the NFL cages all the time when they when type of a victory Mondays and they see on Wednesday federally guys need to wrestle physically I must have been long\nI think a day where they don't have to come into the building is is positive so we're going to make up for that time tomorrow or Wednesday Thursday and friday and make sure you guys are dial manning ready but we just kind of felt like one day off it benefit us more than trying to get back out there\nAnd we'll come back here to the Oscar online show that was head coach Scott Frost discussing the plan of attack this week as he gave the players off Monday\nI'm trying to just give everybody a little bit of rest they don't have a by week into this game was supposed to be the by a week so ah no practice on Monday they didn't work shoulder pads I Believe on Tuesday a so they've really tried to\nLessen the workload and make it more mental than physical as they get ready for but then cook when the segment here of the ... by ten or sports bar and grill five locations and all all want to hear in Lincoln\nGet on entertainers for Saturday's but then I took one game or afterwards there'll be plenty of college football on as well as all the NFL action on Sunday at any one of the five or ... are are one location here in Lincoln but\nYou're talking about the approach of the week ... it's an interesting one\nUm but as I've talked to people around the moon cook when program as well they're almost treating it like a by week uh\nGet the impression but them cook when it's not going to play all of their frontline guys for four quarters either they're going to use this as a developmental game I think they know what this game is it's an opportunity for Nebraska to make up a game get a win and but then cook when it's going to get eight hundred thousand dollars for it\nYeah and I think that's in desperate times you've got to\nCall for some unique measures and that's exactly what all these teams had to do basically taking away by like process in the open\nA that really puts a lot of physical demand on your team to make it through that many games or football or without a week off I mean that that ... is so valuable just for guys to get their legs back on her and just step away for the media for everybody you know they don't have that luxury though and like you said that getting that when\nA was the most important thing of all and so you know you've got to do what you got to do and so they've\nHad a unique approach to this week but you're talking to Troy Walters and some of the other coaches are on Wednesday they still had a pretty good legal practice and I guess you know we'll see how that translates into the game 'cause\nI'm last week every day was their best day of practice that they've ever had and that obviously showed for the first time on game day now that you completely changed up your routine um you know basically had one day a full pads practice I think they might go a little bit heavier later in the week\nUm than they normally do but um you know I guess the the fact that the opponent is kind of going in with the same situation helps and allows you to a guest lighten the load a little bit but um again you want to see the when I don't think is as much of a question it's do can you go out there\nAnd dominate this game put up some big numbers and then continue this up word positivity that you built with at first when last week\nOr you don't want to take a step back in terms of execution and you'll want things to be sloppy but if there's one thing we know about this team it's that they're pretty mature group I mean they've continued to come to work every day\nHey even though they were when Louis you know the they had the focus to keep\nWorking hard and and keep kind of buying into the system and everything so I I feel like this this group is fairly mature they had the day off on Monday\nOr Tuesday was they were able to take the pads off halfway through practice and and still keep the intensity level up front talking with some of the guys they they said they they know that they have to respect their opponent whether\nWhether they're playing a high school team or if Alabama was coming into town they they've got to be focused and ready to play Saturday and and then in really I have no reason to to not believe that that's just talk I I think that this team is pretty dialed in amateur and they're handling it that way\nYeah I think it's as a matter of how you manage this game and and what the plan is I think you have to have a couple of plans of attack\nFrom Nebraska but if it goes the plan and you're doing really well and you jump up beginning remember for the Atlantic jumped up on these guys twenty I nothing and then they kind of pull back and that score looked a lot closer than what it was\nBut they're coming off a lawsuit against North Carolina a and T where they were blowing out last week in but they don't cook them and that's the best team in their conference they still have conference games remaining so they also don't want to get their team banged up but I Would think they're going to have kind of an internal plan that will not be made public about how they\nYou know get guys and if we're by this much we're going to kind of rotate guys in this quarter at this time um I Do know that it sounds like both\nA Andrew bunch and ... kind of splitting the ... the number two off into this week so I imagine we're going to see both quarterbacks play but\nIt's a matter of how much do you play your front line guys particularly some of these guys like running backs um defined as a bow ma Washington but can you get miles Jones enemy we've we've talked about some of these guys for a long time and they still haven't been able to get on the field yet\nIt was starting to get to that point in the season where you're hitting a final four game window where you want to try and make some of those guys then because you don't if you don't so\nMaybe not this week obviously is would be ideal if you get out to a huge lead and you can play a lot of those guys but you know at some point you know they got to utilize those four games I Would expect to see several new faces especially if things go according to plan but\nThe other side of that though is you know this is a team that uh the biggest pitch is recruiting and look at the numbers we put up and you know look at look at how potent softens could be\nThis could be a pretty good opportunity to pass some stats so at the end of the year when you're in December ... recruiting trail you could point your final numbers\nAnd say look what we average than if you go out and put up six hundred yards of ... and sixty points or whatever they can do on Saturday and that would go a long way and helping that and you have some individuals that are looking for some milestones to divine as it has a legitimate chance to be Nebraska's first thousand yard back\nSince two thousand fourteenth family Morgan is creeping up on Kennedy and he's thirty five catches to catch Kenny bills a career record and then ... ... thousand yard receivers ... so there's guys that have the opportunity to really pads some stats and take a big jump toward some significant um individual milestones that you know\nShortening the amount of time they can play in this game might hurt their chances and doing that\nYeah I think you're going to see Nebraska go go out to produce feverish pace than the first half and and probably put up a ton of numbers and that first before they really start inserting a lot of new faces in but but you do have to take advantage of that opportunity to to put in the miles Jones to put an even guys like like a J von ...\nI'm going to go well beyond a senior running back and that hasn't gotten a touch all year I mean this is probably the only time maybe Illinois but this might be the only time I'll play all year so yeah you want to reward a few of these guys right Nate\nYeah you have to I think you you you absolutely have to and I guarantee you\nA witness organizes is a staff is uh there's there's a plan in place I promise you that now obviously they're not going to\nReveal what the plan is but a guarantee you that all the faces of fans have been kind of curious about where they're at or why they are playing a whole lot or whatever we're probably going to see them especially in the second half of this weekend\nYou're listening to the Oscar online show as we talk Nebraska but then cook when I Want to hit on a running backs real fast before we leave your just that combination Robin ... Washington and how it's almost made things easier here the last few weeks just having to versus three and you're seeing both of these guys get more and more comfortable\nI think just having that many backs was almost a made things a little more complicated than it needed to be a you know\nThere was also make everybody happy trying to keep everybody politically on the same page but now you don't have to worry about Greg\nThough yeah clearly there were people that were very concerned about what their role is going to be and when I got taken away they didn't handle it well so\nDo you got guys that for one are producing at a very high level right now I mean that that one two punch of his ego in Washington\nIs that good of a ... brat has happened that backfield in several years so um that is good and then the guys that are team first players to 'em and I think that's a huge part in Adrian Martinez is that third element this round games clicking on all cylinders\nWell we're gonna talk some defense re comeback Eric ... got the rest of the black church and hand them out this week to the remainder of the starting events but one guy didn't accept is we'll talk about that and much more next year you're listening to the ... show [noise]\nApache ... extending their inventory reduction blowout sales through October thirty first period to any of the three locations in Bellevue Lincoln or a car to take advantage of mind blowing deals before the end of the month had saved thousands of dollars on the RV up your dreams of ... referred RV dealer so hurry\nThe in the jury was such a blow out ads are silver thirty first\nI ask ... car care I don't ... it was just the best of all my three categories because I've been going on ... while my vehicles for years and years I Hope you'll give them a dry ... car care dot com making a pie banana reserve or free loan or car\n\nThan it goes back to the whole issue of Nebraska's inability to get to the quarter back I mean that's been one of their biggest problems defensively because when you're not creating pressure\nYou're putting so much responsibility on the back into your house it's never asked his back and hasn't been any good and so it's just been a total disaster so ah hopefully that will continue to improve they can recruit some of those elite level pass Russia's and then uh maybe the penalties will start to balance out as a result\nYeah I'm not going to give the rest of the complete past there because that is still\n... has been hold over his career and it hasn't been called\nThe little pretty unbelievable that but but the fact remains is Nebraska hasn't had an elite level pass Russia since Randy Gregory uh ... can get in balance could get in but really where it happens mostly is is off the edge when you've got a guy who's coming off the edge\nA that you have to account for all the time in Nebraska just has not had a guy for a since since Randy Gregory and and to get one or to get another one in the program you have to have someone that that can show the ability to Russia passer and hopefully someone emerges you're for Nebraska in that regard\nAre we come back we'll be joined in Studio by husk or online intern Eli snow as we'll take your questions in the mail back that's next year you're listening to the house Caroline show\nIt was radio eleven ten K.

Robin wash it and we're gonna welcome in the world famous millennial Oscar online intern Eli snow what do you got for us in the mail back\nHey guys though the first question I have for you or what are the biggest things you are looking for this week even though we are playing and inferior team\nCan Nebraska execute go to work and just take care of business I mean can they make this look like what it's supposed to look like that's what I Want to see\nExactly I mean go out there dominate the first quarter nominate the second quarter pull the majority of stars by halftime and much new guys play get some of those young guys involved in that we were talking about earlier symbols freshmen and just kind of a make as much of a week off as possible\nYeah I couldn't agree more I I Want to see a clean game you know not a bunch of penalties are procedural things I Want to see Nebraska and go out and take care of business and and pretty much cos with what the reserves and the\nSo I guess is what I Want to see in the second half I Want to see a dream Martinez and divine as they go on the bench eating a runs on having a game story written by after I Want to be done where I can get ready for the world series and the Dodgers game that night so our next question what do you have\nAlready said robbing kind of touched on this earlier but at this point in the scenes and what is more likely Stanley Morgan ... or divine as the bell hits one thousand yards\nI think there's a pretty good chance to the three get it and I wouldn't rule out depending on the numbers from this game Saturday if they can somehow sneak goes a boat like one fifty then he's up to seven if he's in I mean he's he's going to get a thousand\nYeah with the way they've been run on the ball I think that's almost most likely of those uh just because I mean they've been he's averaging what like a hundred and fifty are he's got a at least a hundred and fifty yards and three of his last four games he's four hundred over five and he's got out there in ... in Illinois still on the schedule so I mean there's an opportunity there to make up a whole bunch of your\nButter Iowa in Michigan State or to the better rushing defenses in the country so there's going to be some challenges to get to a thousand but I think it happens I don't know how do you think\nYeah I I think so I think a divine probably gets to a thousand free and I ... I guess I shouldn't say easily but\nI Would not be surprised if that happens and then I think at least one of the family or J. D. hits a thousand yards receiving as well I think the\nUm with the way that Adrian Martinez has been throwing the ball um in with the emergence of J. D. uh that that could open up Stanley a little bit more down the stretch almost kind of lean a little bit more towards family\nOr maybe getting there before JD will see\nThat he needs what three hundred and eighty six more yards or to get to a thousand so I mean he's shown capable of getting two hundred in the game so who knows\nSo few weeks ago has scar on line rider mentioned nor for

more like this kind of trying to make it look real good on paper and in in ... it's a walk on off\nYeah yeah and if you mean PJ flick dresses the way he dresses for a reason and that sort of ... and he would make a good car salesman so uh yeah this is this is kind of some you know shiny walk on offer wrapped up a package real nice they call it a maroon offer\nBasically warnings yeah which basically means that hey come and walk on and we guarantee you that after two years you'll be put on scholarship so it's not a it's not a technical you know deal it's not like a ... shirt but everyone's heard of or even a blue shirt which was a more you know kind of a newer term that that some schools have\nThey've used to to kind of get around the rules but um this basically is the preferred walk on offer and they'd guaranteed him the after two years in the program he'll be put on Scalia [laughter]\nThis is the eye vision at a car dealership when they're writing all the numbers on a piece of paper and just trying to confuse you and like and this is how will get your payments down to two fifty a month\nYeah this this just a bunch of numbers moved around and and and kind of package differently\nAll right what are you got for us next alley All right so speaking of recruits which your crew of Nebraska's past was the one that got away for you who do you wish you would have seen in Nebraska uniform that new brass had an actual shop\nWhere did you just go Nebraska ... did you say that like I said in Nebraska has lots of juice or just give it a hard time\n[noise] there's one for me NATO all says Reggie Smith\nUm the corner back out of Oklahoma just because it was early on\nIn my days are really covering recruiting in and you knew how good Reggie Smith was going to be an a brass gift you came here and\nI'll never forget him at the camp in John Blake with his escalate driving Reggie Smith around campus which I don't even know ... was within the rules but he was given a ride to the dorms from the practice fields and his escalate and\nI like it I mean and they made that a lot closer for recruiting battle for a top Oklahoma kid than it probably should have\nWell yeah that was I'll say this that was he committed to John Blake and then and when and then when he officially announced it you know in and made it public that he was going to Oklahoma John Blake was crushed like he was I'm telling you like like tears in in his office\nThose guys are probably going to be coming in for that weekend and uh they're very well could be a ... of tackled targets a visiting that weekend too so that's shaping up to be a really ... go heavy recruiting we can now Nathan Nebraska had\nA fish will visit weekend but really the biggest ... a visitor news was not an official was Bryce Ben heart coming back to Lincoln to watch the Oscars dismantle his home state gophers\nAnd now we've been talking about this for seemingly a long time uh but when the heck is Bryce been heart going to pull the trigger because it feels like it's going to happen here soon\nYeah I I think that that's kind of\nA all signs are pointing that direction is just a matter of when that's going to you know\nA war why he's dragging his feet or when that's necessarily going to happen um and that is anybody's guess right now because he plays things about as close to the vest says is anyone I've ever seen a dozen grant interviews um you know there's very little information that comes out of his camp or you know whether it be from his dad or from from his coach or whoever\nUh there's very very little information that comes out but what I Do know is he remains extremely ... and it obviously they're not visiting for the heck of it he came in for his official for the Akron\nGame was unable to see or inexperienced and entire game\nUm obviously because it's because of the the weather um and so they came in for the Minnesota game and I tell you what\nAre you really could not have drew up any better for him to come in and and see an explosive offense to to have that type of atmosphere where people are jacked up to for Nebraska getting their first when I'm In and then\nTo go into the locker room afterwards in in to have that experience where you had a a full locker room of excited players excited coaches\nI mean that is a completely organic feeling or that you you can't you can't duplicate that you you can draw the perfect uh you know visit itinerary for these recruits\nBut that type of celebration an atmosphere is something that you just no matter what you put together that that's something that will stick with these kids for very long time and uh and I think Ben heart will probably be making a decision sooner than later and I still think it's in the ... has the lead there\nNow Nate or the other big a recruiting thing wasn't involving anything from the weekend at Minnesota and the game it's Minnesota was\nKind of just the chatter the movement behind the scenes involving one Dale Robinson who set to make his decision on November first now one that will not be making a visit to Nebraska for this but then ... game because he can't get here and time but man it's sure looking like he could be a husk or here by next week\nIf it's been hard as is the top overall offensive target on the ... board than Mondale Robinson is was probably one be and you could you could probably flip flop those guys maybe it's Robinson won a a bad heart one B. but bottom line is that it's looking very very good for you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn
