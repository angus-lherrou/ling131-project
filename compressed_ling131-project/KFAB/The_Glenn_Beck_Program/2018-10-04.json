in many cases not even now you buy things on line\nSometimes you're not actually buying them you're just renting them you're entering an ongoing relationship\nWhat does this mean for um society how is

is professor of law and I'm\nThe author of the book what we buy when we buy now and you can find more information at the end of ownership dot com Aaron so tell me what how you've been looking at this\n[noise] so I think in the short term we're likely to see more changes in the way our commercial interactions occur and the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured will say we're going to start to see people become more and more customs to paying for temporary access to resources rather than owning them and in some ways I I think that makes\nSome degree of sat there are some people for whom owning a car is it necessary they'd rather be able to take a left or use some sort of\nCar share application and I think\nThat makes a lot of sense what I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from ownership and towards temporary access a shift away from independent control\nOf resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will of the companies that control access\nSo ... maybe let me give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's a classic car but\nI don't own the software that runs the car and if any time the software company says no I'm not going to and we're not going to support that or we want to discontinue or whatever\nI I I Do I have a heat the junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nI think the cars a great example um we see this issue come up and the motor vehicle context or the ... the way it come up um [noise] uh most most recently and most often is actually not with cars but with tractors or John Deere\nUm the law are running American farm equipment company makes exactly this argument that they own the software and the tractors that say they sell to American farmers and that means that farmers can only get their tractors repaired I authorized John Deere a dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop or you know finally repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in a sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us do we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing forced to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote sell you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property uh it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\n[noise] I I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being created it discourages people from um from as he said team dream which the same as if they are and we have a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made over the centuries in this country that didn't\nCome from giant ... departments they came from individuals\nMessing around with things down in their garage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities but even even more broadly at a if we're just courage and thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the ...\nThe old [noise] and I worry that that creates a sort of complacency in uh in our in our population in our country and you know not not ... to July to the level here but for democracy to function people have to steal and they have to be\nIn charge of a lot she asked to be invested in making informed decisions and\n... that that you know this\nThis lack of control over the every day to says might play too much broader set of problems when it comes to people feeling like active participants in society and democracy\nI couldn't agree with you I couldn't agree with you more um I\nI just don't think this is the way society is thinking anymore everything is about the collective\nAnd very little is about the individual and you know I think he understood you are understated the case\nOf tankers I mean if you look at the inventions in America ... a lot of them a lot of our progress came from what used to be called tankers people who just did things in their own garage and and uh\nAnd now with the weather is that the government or these corporations everyone is being told that the way it is sit down shut up you can't do anything about it and I think that's extraordinary I mean that that that\nYou know in in decades that's what created China in many ways that's what they don't think of things the same way that we do they don't have that that um spirit of invention that America has always been known for\n\nSo I I agree with you that um that the history of innovation in this country has um benefited greatly from individual\nCreators and we we need to keep an environment in which people have that ability to experiment um to innovate and ultimately it to to share\nIn New York City the first visit fire ranting posts to the United states

society that is America\n[noise]\nWednesday October ... and you're listening to the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nOne of my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nDana he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just\nTelling you he he doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google or has and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there more than just a company and making money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it and Schmidt has been always very direct about saying yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values\nOf the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move a singer directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen\nThat right yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very uh you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton\nThey were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming\nThe results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is of Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's it's a verb auto Google it yes well I mean Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always change the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was\nIt was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about uh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general the whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news\nAnd the debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story the pointed this out in the open you have combat and by the way the fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of\nJesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you to vote and different wet I wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation\nBias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you not I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent yes\nAnd it's not very good\nAt it not the name of the documentary is\nThe creepy line at the ... dot com Peters whites there is a with it and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform ing\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about\nInformation out of you know that it's true and we'll prove information will\nWill actual information\nWill you be allowed to see or keep in the

by another student told Chris Baker there are some terrifying new developments\nTies between the stuff we talked about in the book and what we're seeing over the past few days off of the cabinet\nAre you there I Hope you have recognized this unseen this ... this vindicate the book one hundred and ten percent what's happened it because as I've said since since the trial or the hearing last\nWeek the Republicans are playing this perfectly I have not seen the Republican Party ever behave in a way that I thought ten from the American judge\nTen from me and this fits exactly\nTo my point in addicted to outrage people think that uh and this is why it's taken the book to be able to it's it's taken me a year and I wrote I wrote the book once and then I rewrote it a second time 'cause it wasn't right because I learned so much as I was writing it\nAnd the um the point of the book people look and say that's a surrender you want us to surrender no I don't I don't\nI Want you to change your approach because that's the path to winning they'll let me show you in the book you will see it without having a I Wish capital had happened before the book because I Would have used this as the case\nFirst lock yourself on to the truth but be old enough for new information so you don't just stay blind if there is new information you have to take\nInto consideration right but you don't surrender what you know to be true so now let's watch with Kevin what happened with Kevin ... for the first time a president this time it's it's a Donald Trump\nTook one of the brave as physicians I think I've seen a president do\nThis was I think this was worse than Clarence Thomas because we are in the meat to society where you just go along with it you don't change you don't defend your just everybody just blindly goes oh my gosh yes he did it he is a pariah\nSo the stakes are higher\nThan they were in Nineteen Ninety One and also that the society has changed remember we were still tolerating you no monkey business and sexual harassment and everything else that wasn't what it is now\nThe hierarchy has changed the power structures have changed now you must blindly believe the woman\nAnd you've seen people let me look at the hits we took on Bill O'Reilly because I said Bill O'Reilly ... I'm Sorry I won't take it on somebody else's I'm a word I've worked with him we've seen him in social situations it may be true I've talked to him personally I I\nHeard his explanation\nI'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt oh my gosh the world ended when I did that guy I lost friends over that okay well whatever so you\nDo not surrender but as I said with Bill O'Reilly if I find new information and Bill O'Reilly actually is that dude I'm going to be the first to torture him\nI've heard you say that to his face yeah or or on the phone yeah you know you've said it to him yeah but look if if if this turns out to be something that I cannot be associated with the ... yeah and he was he was fine with them right [laughter] and so what are the Republicans do first they stood\nWith Kavanaugh because they believed he had a right to answer these charges but they didn't mock her\nThey did say this is a sham because look at the facts\nIf they want if if she would have um appeared during the hearings\nAnd you said well this is a shame 'cause look out of ... no no no no there's still time but because it came out in the eleventh hour there were facts that led to the Republicans to say and I think any human to say okay wait a minute was slow down on this\nBut\nWhat did we do the Republicans then said let's hear her they were gracious tour they said we'll come see you what happened the Democrats\nLied the Democrats through a flaming a an insult to anyone who said that the Republicans it'd invited her and she said no you are a monster the Republicans did not respond in kind\nThen they sat down and they listen to her\nDid you see the way that she was treated in the line of questioning nobody rolled their eyes on the right nobody mocked her while she was there\nEvery one was deferential everyone was kind to her everyone wanted her to feel comfortable to speak in case she had something actual to present\nMost Republicans went into watching those hearings with an open mind\nI listen to her and I thought okay she has some credibility here now it's time has gone on that has gotten less and less as more facts have come out but I wanted to hear cabinet if Kavanaugh didn't have a stronger response\nI Would have probably been and said I you know I don't know I I think Kavanaugh as\nI I don't know I was at least willing to consider that point Kavanaugh spoke I said I Believe Kavanaugh\nOut of the two of them I Believe then it came to the FBI they said look it's just I mean you can't give us seven days just give us seven days okay I'm not for it because I Know what the Republican or the Democrats are actually doing which they did\nBut okay Jeff Flake said seven days so we gave him seven days it's still not good enough for them\nBut nowhere has the Republican Party up until and this is debatable up until a Donald Trump mocked her the other night and I don't think he did he mocks the process he mocked her evidence you didn't mock her he mocked the evidence\nThe evidence is marketable\nLiberate the Democrats are multiple but you'll notice no one in the Republican Party has has taken her apart hold her name's or anything else\nWhat they did do is they sided with righteous indignation\nIf they continue to stand with righteous indignation based on evidence and facts\nWhat's happening you're seeing a shift in the polls you're seeing people start to say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you starting to see people back the Republican Party you're seeing people start to back this entire process as being a sham\nBecause we allowed the people to come up with that\nWe allowed the people we just said let's look for facts\nAnd the facts will speak for themselves but you will you will not be able to do that if you're punching back while you're looking for facts now\nThis has never worked before that's what people will say that doesn't work we always play the nice guy no we don't we always play the nice guy and cave\nI Am not suggesting that we have\nI'm suggesting you stand in movable in that storm on last facts change\nIf they change you move if the facts remain where the facts are you don't move you just don't punch people in the face you don't become them I Do not want to be Cory Booker\nI Do not want to be somebody you know the Jonah Goldberg pointed out in a an essay he wrote yesterday that I thought it was really good the press keeps asking the Democratic senators well seven days the FBI did this will this be enough\nWell let's be enough for what for them to still vote no\nThey didn't have any intention of changing their mind\nThe Republicans actually went into it saying it better be good evidence or people might change their mind I talked to senators who are not on the list\nOf changing their mind that we're thinking I might change my mind I have to I have to think about this early on I Want to see what the FBI now they haven't said any of that\nOut loud I talk to them we were open Democrats were not\nAmericans are that is the point of the book this shows you how to fight we can win\nIf we are kind of open minded we listen to others but we don't give in when

listening to Glenn Beck program [noise]\nGo to Brian in Colorado hello Brian how are you [noise] hey how are you doing very good thanks for calling in what's on your mind\nYes so quick question just kind of going off of your book now with the whole cabinet enjoying on all the attention seems to have turned away from Trump because there's no outrage there all the allergies with Kevin I'm just kinda wondering how you see the interplay between that\n[noise] um because Kavanaugh is an easier target because Donald Trump has not responded in the fashion that they probably expected him to respond and the reason why\nI Would imagine is because you know he doesn't have a you know a good record on speaking about you know moral issues\nAnd so somebody has said ... shop and he has that has that has given him real power because all the Trump is a is involved on this is\nIs he going to keep standing and because he has a spine yeah he's standing and that's what the president needs to do at this point and it is also allowed for the very first time\nIt's given a spine to the Republicans\nSo they had to go after cabinet what what else are they going to do he's the he's the target but Kavanaugh also has remained cool um until it was really appropriate had he come out and made crazy you know angry statements prior to\nKnow but his his timing of being angry is not a sign that he has a reckless temperament\nIt was appropriate for the time if you were thinking human being and you'd you are looking at things for you're looking at the facts level you completely connected with Kavanaugh's opening statement where he said this is ridiculous\nYou have destroyed me you've destroyed my family he made a statement that was full of facts refuting the things that she had said it was totally appropriate\nWhat's the result the result is I think Kavanaugh is going to a win the nomination\nIf he doesn't and it will be ... be because a Republican or maybe a couple of Republicans\nLose their spine because there is there are no facts on this so they lose their spine if they do it they will be losers in this does that help you Brian is that what you were thinking\nYeah that doesn't make sense that this kind of finding the weak argued as opposed to the strong lawn and because that's what they do is exploit the week and um yeah so I appreciate that\nUm do you wanted to I'm going to send you a book for getting on the air or if you get on the air uh start sending your books if you did you want the book or the audio\nYeah the book out of it okay and Bryan B R y A N E R I Am okay\nBut I asked thanks Bryan free she had it's in the mail or let me go to a\nYear it's still sitting right in front of an Brian don't believe it it's not in the mail yet liar let me go to a let me go to\nPhyllis hello Phyllis could lining Glenn how I Am I'm very good\nReason for my call as I wanted to tell you a couple of things I appreciate you taking my call and I've learned a lot from you over all these years so I thank you for that You're welcome victim of sexual child abuse or my father was a pedophile and I suffered\nFor many many years until I put an end to it and unfortunately Glenn no one believes me knowing [noise] so you know I just kind of felt that I have to deal with this I have to get over it it's it's not easy to do that but I knew that\nBlaming my you know what happened was not going to get me anywhere in life so I understand in a way why no one you know talked up and now these days you know twenty Thirty years ago\nIt was not the way it was it was not [noise] we weren't we didn't think people were like that and we didn't want to look at it if it was it's horrible the we've made good progress on that\nYes we have however we swung from one end all the way to the other with no middle ground show what I'm Upset about is that everyone believes this this doctor\nOkay just on her ...\nIt has to money which wasn't even you know significant and ah they're they they just believe that because of the house they went through and to me I don't understand why they don't listen to the facts\nAnd and this is one of the things are so disturbing about this the obviously the me too concept is really\n... really important and early ... important like it it really it it could make a real difference and instead what it's turning into is here's a tool for Democrats used to destroy people's\nLives which is an awful outcome or what a great outcome would be out of this in my opinion is that going forward or people like Phyllis\nWould it would be believed\nWould at least be taken seriously and not have taken seriously believed if they have the evidence taken seriously and and in and\nAnd would not fear coming out because if you had a evidence and you had a a real story to tell it would be believed correct\nAnd that's that's that is the outcome that I think rational\nAmericans are looking for them they want this to and they think this is horrible\nBut they don't want to go the other way this has become um a vendetta you know fill us as you said you knew that the anger wasn't going to get you anywhere in life so you had to deal with it\nIf you deal with the is the situation\nUm you have a chance to grow it is much better if the person who has done it to you has\nUm has ... it's a consequences or or has has you know admitted it at least or something it's hard when people don't apologize or don't admit it and they just get away with it is really really hard\nBut that sometimes what happens but by by moving on with your life\nYou're not trying to convict every man and that's what's happening right now there are these women who have suffered this and have not healed and so they want everybody to be believed because no one would believe there's\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Omaha", "day": "04"}
