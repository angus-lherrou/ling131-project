peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I paid ... is the\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in protest but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned the ones we wrote spanned Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so uh I think as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and unable where they got a

a on a on Twitter she is one of the the if not the mastermind behind a the\nA papers of record that were were being written\nA four four feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique splitting\nAre not really critique to no way that most people would um just quickly go through some of them are\nGoing in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out of the violence of object to vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying used to work in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us Theresa submitted and um give it another go\nIt says this is a far says it's a solid that say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah they're loaded argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a\nInventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called step forward step back game as a possibility once they're turning out privileged they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more ...\nYou are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the degree privileged a classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this\nSet of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence teams and they said watch it with compassion\nThat re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist\nIn a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing\nThat you would expect out of a scholarly paper they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on but um\nThe the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n... if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that\nMean to the university system would would [noise] what does that mean\nSo the all events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year so this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and\nSocial justice side or the fields topics courses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff\nWould take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but we'll just have to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard\nJournalist wasn't some fringe of journal in education this was the gold entered feminist philosophy journal ... that we were working with here which is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist\nWhich you don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad idea of some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely\nTerrifying like this educational thing and then they wander them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or were based this program on studies that show\nWell that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies are coming from a place they can't tell\nA truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem\n[noise] James one of the other ones I found um disturbing or was the uh HBO age to ...\nTo was was accepted can you explain the explain this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that\n... ... stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes that code namely gave for convenience what they argue is that that you can only properly criticize\nThings that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize postal jobs that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it

I. health centers all over town but now we have a CIA chai health center\nCenter we see each other health get to be associated with something that is positive and that has health field if you think about it health care providers typically you don't think about us until you're scared and injured in sick this for us gives us an opportunity to continue to advance our mission which is about creating health in our community in different ways\nBut you know the other thing for us that was important as we worked\nThrough the process of deciding whether or not this was something we wanted to pursue\nWas that we were actually contributing to the city the money that we pay for this agreement not only allows the city to avoid having to tax a tax payers or should there be shortfalls but also provides resources to the city to continue to upgrade and improve what I Believe is a\nCrown jewel not only of the of the city of Omaha but of the reason\nIt's unique there as far as I Know there's no other health system like ours that has this kind of relationship but I Believe it's also great for the community it's great for our organization\nWhat are some of the things that maybe people wouldn't think that the H. I. health is involved in in the communities Dr probably are are most visible community benefit is that we provide care to those are the most unfortunate in our community those that have the least resources those that don't have\nGood insurance to cover all the costs of the care they need so that is the thing that's always top on our list that is part of our mission which is to serve everyone in the community with particular focus on those that are most in need we have now over four thousand different individuals\nThat have participated from I think a hundred and Seventy different organizations specifically around the topic of behavioral health and we do that 'cause it is so important to the community and it's part of our mission\nAnother CEO use you know for me you know hard in our community and thank you were listening to this is my heart Omaha a radio station\nI'm a forty year old man they walked in there to get his high school diploma very hard for me but Mr is Ellie she gave me direction and he's forty\nFifty percent of getting your high school diploma\nWhere no one gets you thinking of this in your height\nCame near you finish like a ... or ... or ... by the dollar general later foundation and the ad council\nTo protect her home and family unit disaster Terry was willing to Wade through water mud\nInsurance paperwork yeah I can do that [noise]\nGo ... by simply understanding and updating whether insurance covers and doesn't cover no she'll be better prepared no matter when disaster strikes learn other simple ways to protect your home and family before a natural disaster at ready dot Gov that's ready Dr method from FEMA jumped [noise]\nNights are perfect for the radio especially when you hear what we have to say and the Alan Nathan show right after the Glenn Beck weekend Seventy eight on news radio eleven ten K. at bay [noise]\nHey by the way the real quick emerged tree one really need your help uh for disaster relief mercury one dot org slash hurricane relief Eighteen if you can make a donation that would really help what normally cover\nA individual divorces but this one's interesting uh someone a couple has divorced because a woman was caught on Google street view running her fingers through another man's hair a sitting there laying out a bench in public in a buddy and I guess with the picture was taking a twenty Thirteen\nAnd he didn't know about it for years it was on Google or he found out about it a asked her about it and she admitted to the affair and now they're getting divorced so thanks\nGoogle another uh another wonderful do they're not doing\nAnything [laughter] I mean I'm not doing anything wrong [laughter] what\nRadio eleven ten K.

place the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything\nWell then ... what\nDo we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you\nLock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that pretty frightening pretty frightening so now we're\nTalking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\n\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected\nRight on my way up to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this was an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports at for example throwing um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go\nWhich I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean that you know it'd be which may not want that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... says you should run themselves in the city is getting run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make that although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has\nTo do and how to live they don't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's\nWhy the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the truth out\nRight and it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could a race to the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be\nThat the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly\nSo things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through\nAnother body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower it was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq during I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power\nOf their state then it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is an ...\nSituational but I'll sign it was way no that's the opposite this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Vioxx the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several stories in a row the mic give you the argument for a king right I mean okay [laughter] really they failed or have we not been using them properly\n\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife and saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed\nOr no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure park right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented\nBut the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane absolutely insane\nAll right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the ... the Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ... can anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City of you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially if it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] what what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gun or you're young women they break his window and chase them down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor\n... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying\nTo make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right\nThey act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's so they have no no way to win\nIt's a great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes they that this is the job of being married right out of your job of being a leader yes supposed to\nActually have an idea and do something which I think he did by the way I think you're right what did you were not a week is just me right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes his opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah I'm a fully nudge more on the end of outside\nAnd you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI\nThe FBI building in Portland is ... is under siege for ... to ...

K. F. A. B. [noise]\n\nMen the Klan Batman [noise]\nThere's a fascinating story about Michael ... play um if you're a long time\nWe started this program you know that a micro play is a a friend of the program and somebody that I have no I think since before he was really really famous\nUm uh this comes from the daily I'm male thought geo dot U. K. I I'm not sure that this I'm not sure that Michael wasn't joking and part of this\nGive you the highlights Michael blaze officially retired from music following his sons no ... is following\nIt's a no was cancer battle the singer forty three explained the heartache injured following his son's cancer diagnosis as that just three years old has changed this perception of life\nAnd he is done now with fame was a new album out um titled love on the way he explained that this is time for him to step away from music wanting to leave it at the very top after making the perfect record Michael revealed his decision to quit the industry in what he claimed to be his last interview\nMy whole being has changed since my son got cancer he said Michael ... says he was embarrassed to realize how egotistical he had become as he nurse ... Noah back\nTo health but now he's got his mojo back\nThe Canadian singer has won four Grammys sold Seventy five million records earning I'm thirty five million dollars a year a he has been married to a stunning Argentina and model an actress for seven years the couple of live a life of luxury and the three with her three children know a five ally is two and a daughter video amber Betty Who is eleven weeks old\nYet all of this seemed to meaningless when Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago and the devastated capital immediately announced that they were putting their careers on hold for the care of their son Noah has been declared now cancer free\nI'm Michael ... is very emotional his brown eyes swell up at the mere mention of the C word cancer there's too many see where it's now and it is clear he is living in the shadow of what he describes his two years of hell you\nJust want to die he said I don't I don't even know how it was breathing my uh my wife was the same and even though I was a stronger of the two of us I wasn't strong my wife was I'm Sorry I Can't make it to the end of the sentence let's just say we find out who we are with these things\nGoing through this with Noah I didn't I didn't question who I was I just question everything else why are we here is this all there is because of this is all there is there has to be something bigger\nHe says that one way you got through was to pretend he was in ... ah Roberto I'm a ... a character from life is beautiful\nI don't know if that was a choice he said but that's who I became for instance I never called at the hospital I called it the ... hotel\nUm he said every day I got extra bed sheets and I would build a tent for NOAA and just made the best of it\nIt's such a difficult to exercise it hurts me and it hurts to talk about no because it's not my story to tell it's his but my whole life has changed my perception of life I don't even know if I could get through this conversation without crying and I never lost control of my emotions before in public\nI actually thought I'd never come back to the music business I never fell out of love with music I just needed to put it aside what\nIt was hard was going to the store and buy hotdogs and toilet paper and going to the gas station going for a walk by the seat of clear my head everyone recognizes me and says how's your son you think you're close to getting over it and you're stuck right back into it but at the same time I was given back my faith in humanity\nUm he said uh the illness made him realize he needed to make a change in his life I spent a good time a good deal of time with people who aren't so lucky\nThis terrible news came I realized I wasn't really having fun in the music business I had lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is it had been a while since I had been having fun\nIt started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was old blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\n[noise] I was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realized that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThen I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I'd become so anxious\nThere were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that if you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker I started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was in insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish\nIt affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is fascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Mike who play was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted and him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage\nIs that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is it is so in ... yeah he loves it\nI mean you can tell when you see 'em live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point\nBut they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it completely", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha",
