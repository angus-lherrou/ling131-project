I mean you know as you get into deep south in ... but I don't even know how just to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know when you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using it and I went to duck to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff inducted go on chrome\nSo now I've got ...

that well I Know you've got four people over here who did ...\nMultiple huge stories of fake accusations of sexual assault that have happened over the past few months so this happens all the time because women are people right whether people in there and they'll do bad things just like men do bad things\nBig story ah I think it was in California of a high school kid and I was accused by these high school girls they called them demean girls huh yeah it was in the same city where are the movie supposedly took place um and so these girls all got together because they didn't like this guy and decided to accuse him of sexual assault\nHe went through all kinds of hell over it\nAnd uh after six months or a year they finally admitted nano we made that up why\n'cause we didn't like to listen to him and I like to look at it\n... oh ... wow amazing so did you hear the credible stuff did you hear make them scared the ... make them scared no I haven't does he was from the University of

increasingly embracing mhm legitimizing and calling for\nAnd what are those the normal civilized way to escalate a situation when you're not getting what you want right you can do things like you could escalate your language that's hard to escalate past gang rape accusations it's kind of hard to go past that with your language I guess you can go to murder and go to genocide as a couple of other things I guess you could accuse U.S Supreme court\nJustice up to get your way uh then you have a like a\nThey already they already say the United states is a genocidal carry right I mean there's there's no way you can increase the language against America were men so then you can go to structural\nOr procedural type of things but I mean look what they did here they they pulled out every stop they tried to get a they'd delayed until late in delayed they tried to get an FBI investigation and they said that wasn't enough there were seven at the end he said seven FBI back riding with no\nEvidence at all of these zero thousands and thousands of people show up screaming we believe we we believe the survivor well\nSurvivor of what why I mean until it's confirmed survivor right like I mean at least to us she made if something happened to her and she's telling the truth like having a yes she's a survivor to herself but as a society we have to judge based on the facts\nI and I own it
