Republicans in the ... uh it looked really positive we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in ... red state where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Ted Cruz going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou mean oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called ... so you point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point I'm\nOf a several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nTimes doing something really really interesting in which you know normally you kind of see hoarding news well I didn't do that or they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the football game happened and then you go after them right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the resulted in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing as they make the calls\nWho's voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addictive to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I have one point\nYesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls and had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is very tend to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is a is\nPart of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but Cruz in that\nPoll wound up up a nine point in that one and he seemed to us when our eyes are open up a lead there again and I'm not surprised by it either about

Fox News this storm is gone to clean up under way in the Florida Panhandle one day after hurricane Michael made landfall Fox's deep Rapaport has more lively\nStill governor Rick Scott toward some of the worst hit areas sang it looked like tornadoes shredded them when everybody to be say\nUh I like to buy these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation is that high employment I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still I on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what ...\nWhat good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was ... and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly more people out of stocks and bonds because why not just rates rise than\nBonds are more attractive relatively than shocks I'm usually those effects of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to show off term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we dollar shave real science of inflation although allergic prices are rising but the other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth that says\nTo the fed and and uh John John Powell why you take in a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring and I I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want to ... but just it's just the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that's job is to squash a stock market rally\nAnd pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm a inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation or ... I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe show me that place I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I ... when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative but that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict we see\nAnd I are inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down an affordable and so I ... my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that was and that's where I Am a little concerned by the way I Glenn about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like equivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why hasn't gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon sooner you there yeah maybe near where you just said okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the I'm In the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off it was a result I mean a big rise and the price because people are really concerned about the um\n[noise] you know about the price of the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf our tax that back online bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think well prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean everywhere you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick\nStick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know this the stock market is driven by fear and greed\n[laughter] that's a truism for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale\nBut the last president that I heard really take on the bed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week I don't know why the president is the chief executive officer of the country right he is the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct but I I think there's a lot of ... one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or a falls on high at the fed they act as if there was a temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes\nYou mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally ... percent mortgage interest rates that was all because the fed mistake and uh you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in\nTwo thousand seven and they keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the parade wars a and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it Stephen [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that ... are good\n[laughter] here's my view and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals you got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal here where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before the\nThe deal will have to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and\nThis is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this plan but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating stealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like\nYou know the old Soviet Union in\nTerms of a lot of the tactics they're using that's all I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China let\nMe challenge you on that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about this like if we can't trade with China we'd sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy and Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look\nWe're not gonna give you an unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to\nPlay by the rules I talked to company CEOs all the time of mine who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market you got to give up ownership of your company you have to give up your a trade secret ... I mean we can't live with that is right I'd write when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big but they also weren't our bank at the same time I would feel better about it hey\nStephen quickly one quick question for you and you probably have a gotten a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs in these things going on of allies\nOr any like Canada and ... as a way of negotiating bring these country on the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA two point oh type of situation well that happened but the steel parents are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nWell this is one of the issues that I buy my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum terrorists or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum\n'cause you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but we've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produced I was over it and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make a you know\nBudweiser they're using a lot of

Sunday NFL action\nAt our towners locations but let's get back to Murray's Washington and you know we knew he was talented we knew he was good um but you know a little bit of a road block or speed bumps the last few weeks he didn't play well Michigan\nUm and then obviously he missed the produce game because he was sick that week so I don't think any of us really knew what to expect from him in that game against north western ... I'm Sorry against Wisconsin but he comes in\nAnd it's like wow I mean it it's like he had this another year or two is game um and they use them as a receiver they ran about wide on we'll routes I'm as a running back as a kicker return or um I mean this guy has a chance to be a future star in this program\nYeah and watching that game a it was clear to me it reached Washington was the most dynamic player on the field you know regardless of Wisconsin are brats 'cause roster when he touched the ball he had a gear that no other player in that game had John\nYou never talk and unfair that you know those Wisconsin coaches are probably up in the box looking at your like who the heck is this guy\nAh because I mean that that he was a difference maker when there's a reason I ended up with a hundred and Fifteen total yards I mean he is a versatile do it all type player who Troy Walters or said today on Wednesday\nThat uh you know he has the skill set up a wide receiver so he's a running back by trade but they have no qualms about putting them out why in the slot running among passes out the backfield\nAn utilizing his full ability and that is going to get you on the field a locked in this off and that is exactly what the staff wants out of their skill position players they don't want\nJust a wide receiver or just a running back they want you to be able to do it all so they could find mismatch is and put you in positions where you're going to be able to exploit those mismatch is and\nThat's what I think they're going to do with Washington going forward on there you're going to see him probably a lot more wide receiver I'll just try and get a mountain space against the linebacker or maybe against this lower safety\nAnd utilize that athleticism and speed to its full potential and you know that I think that Wisconsin game was just a taste of what he could bring as long as he stays healthy and is able to continue his upper track\nOr he showed why he was being recruited\nAs heavily as a junior before in his academics really came into play and some ... some teams backed off of him but he's been recruited as a wide receiver a running back and some things even thought that he'd be one heck of a cornerback eh in college so um but yeah you're right it was a difference maker and there's just a little things like\nHe he caught a swing pass someone playing in post spin move on a guy and it was just like whoa\nBecause you really have not seen a player is certainly this year but it's really done anything like that and um yeah he's just a just an electric player in\nThe electorate bonded with sudden the open and he's going to continue to to get better I mean he's nowhere near reached the still developing these newer reaches potential so that is definitely something that I think is going to be pretty exciting for fans to keep track of going forward\nYou're listening here to the ... Enron and Washington a class as we get you ready for Saturday's eleven AM game and evidenced in against north western it will be Nebraska's first time playing eleven AM out there so it'll be interesting to see kind of\nThe crowd break up it's traditionally been a lot of red and I I anticipate we'll still see a lot of red out there are a lot of people play on these trips out and we saw more people on the road three to four weeks now when you count Saturday\nAnd the amount of people that have traveled to some of these road trips um Wisconsin it was as many as we've seen out there obviously since that game one of the Big Ten in Michigan was hum the most by far we've seen in Michigan and I anticipate we're going to see a huge huge a turnout again in Evanston\nWyoming, Michigan people were kind of stunned that they're that many in Nebraska people so for those that didn't get to see the whole stadium out of the visiting section is kind of on I don't know one of the end zone ends of the bowl and that entire top part of that Bob Volpe portion was covered in red and yellow sprinkled throughout the whole stadium\nAnd so I think that caught some of those guys off guard and no it's harder to tell I Wisconsin 'cause everybody's wearing red in those\nThe team gears look very used to be like identical yeah uh you know it's hard to really tell how many were there but it was all out you know when you're asking did something well there was a pretty good contingency cheering and um you know out in downtown Madison the night before you know there are a lot of Nebraska fans that we're invading bars\nJust like they always happen so with northwestern being one of the easiest way to get more appealing trips yeah inch cheapest trips that you can get I expect there's going to be I mean this is kind of the pilgrimage trip for Nebraska than you know you get to go to Chicago spend the weekend there pop over Evanston see a football game for cheap\nAnd you know make a weekend of it so I I don't think despite one five\nI don't think you're going to end the ... and they have never lost there and you know there's a lot of thinking that this could be the game you know like name was talking about earlier that this could be the game and finally clicks for Nebraska so I think they're still going to be a very strong husk or flavor and Ryan field\nWhere I feel like every every year Nebraska plays it almost seems somewhat like a home game I mean there's so many fans are on I forget what year was but didn't didn't northwestern and actually have to call a\nTimeout on well yes yes so it will they had a ...\nOn their own stadium that's I mean then culture that to me that's a that's a huge advantage for Nebraska really the only thing that that you might have a question mark about is is that this will be the first starting to browse goes played on grass or so I mean I don't know if how how much of a factor that will be but it'll\nBe something to pay attention to at least\n... I Want to ask you guys about this as we I'm kind of wrap up off of discussion big position change move this week with camera Germans they took him from tied in\nTo offensive line and they don't want to go to you with this first because our analyst that rivals particularly our friend Josh Hamel he really had a hard time ranking cameras ... organs as a high rank tied in 'cause he just didn't see him as a tide in and and I think we got to give a hat tip the Josh here because um I think the rats can solve the same thing they saw a great elite level athlete\nBut not maybe an elite level tight end and I think Scott process like you know what this guy needs to be on the old line he's going to be the perfect center maybe a guard in the future of Nebraska or\nThat's why I just kept them as as an athlete I'm and didn't want to they want to categorize him as a tide and didn't want to necessarily say that he was a linebacker or defensive and\nUm but you know it's that really doesn't come as a huge surprise to me that this move is happening because\nOf of his his his frame as his overall athleticism he's been the guy that I feel like ever since we initially kind of you know saw him as a freshman every time you see him you know I feel like he gets bigger and bigger and keeps I'm\nGetting taller but he's getting his wider\nI mean he's got a huge frame is continues to fill out so when you when you thought about him as a tide and you go okay well you might be a guy that has to keep weight off of him and and struggled to to stay at a reasonable weight they're so now that he's moved the top offensive line uh you know I think that he's got a great shot to flourish there\nIsn't a long way to go either he's already listed two hundred and Seventy pounds that's unbelievable I did a double take when I saw it on the roster and\nA clearly Scott Frost is incredibly high on this I mean he was the one that spearheaded this movie you went to great Boston Sean backed in and said I really like cameras potential second ... yes call apparently told Greg often that he thinks Kim ... is the second coming of ... who ...

anti John Lindsay this week is\nA tight John Lindsay enrolled at Oregon State and and was able to get in there right before the deadline to be eligible to play college football next year now we're Greg bell goes we still don't know a buddy has missed the deadline to enroll in to a quarter system school that deadline was friday\nAre so great bell really didn't do himself any favors leaving the ... um he's going to have to\nMiss this year and next year now and he's a red shirt next year so uh\nWhoever gave Greg Bella by some I don't know who you are but it was very good advice but ... says let's take our question to the mail bag what do you administer wheels so well we'll start\nOut with this game that's coming up this weekend or what's going to be a bigger impact on Nebraska winning this game is going to be under ten penalties or under three turnovers\nUh\n[noise] I'd like to think you're going to see less than ten ... because my God they've had I mean they have that many\nPenalties every game in a row their ... their due to have a better game on penalty size\nWell always say turnover is doing the staff will tell you turn over the most important stat football\nBut you're playing in northwestern team which is the least to penalize team and all of college football against I never ask a team that is one of the most penalize second to last right yeah so uh you couldn't get a more drastic contrast there but I still say turnovers and I always say turnover because those singlehandedly can change the course of the game\nAnd I'm going to go with turnover too I feel like\nThat's that's still the one thing that can really really swing again obviously any time you're talking ten ten plus turn or penalties\nThat definitely adds up to him and really I I'm not convinced Nebraska is going to going to be able to to cut that in half or or whatever I mean we just have not seen had any indication so far that they can do that so I'm going to turn over ...\nRight so a ... a host but soon cooking on October twenty seventh or traveling to northwestern this weekend and then have Minnesota at home or before then so does the first when come before that October twenty seventh day\nYes uh I really think I mean gosh guys if they win against north western I'm picking them to win this game to wait until the official Saturday morning stories to get my true score um but I Am thinking Nebraska the wind um this game and\nI mean gosh they should be Minnesota at home ... Minnesota is not that good and now they're not that good and if they lose that gave a lot of people would be pretty disappointed obviously but then cook when you know if they lose that game which\nGod Forbid us let's just take old even go there but just take a week off and turn the URL off of ...\nGive give ourselves all little weak ban uh the I I think that north western is certainly a you know go back to old phrase a winnable game and the ... showed when um\nIf they don't Minnesota is even more so um you know these are games that especially like I said earlier going to Purdue already thought that they were winnable I'm probably would have had been more confident how'd they won that produce game\nBut still an rascal matches up well ... they're better than north western acts as a nose and you know personnel they're better than Minnesota so they should win both of those games it's a matter you know if they can finally say out of their own way and play up to their full potential which we've been waiting five games now for them to actually do that\nYeah I think they get a wind before the ... game and it could come this weekend just depends on what teams shown show up in Nebraska and northwestern because north western as looked downright pit of hell at times their um their EKG team and there\nAre they lost the Akron the loss of Duke\nAnd then all of a sudden you you know you go out and and uh you almost beat Michigan should have probably beat Michigan you beat Michigan State on the road I mean so what do they beep or do they beep producer what wouldn't miss or or what North western team are you going to get what Nebraska team shows up so I could have in this weekend definitely though before but then cooking\nYou're losing your house Caroline shore take any questions in the mail bag with Oscar online intern Mike Mr elkhorn wheeler\nAll right so are you guys talked about in the last segment here and the coaches disgusted here or they can you guys discuss the timeframe that it takes the office of offensive and defensive lines to become Big Ten ready you\nKnow the thing about skilled positions is as we've seen this year you can plug in guys overnight and then have success we've seen when they drew Martinez in ... Washington I'm In what they've been able to do and you know we saw last year with ... freshman immediately breaking records and Nebraska\nBut often civil line you cannot cheat your way to go off into line it is years of hard work development\nUm mentally and physically and ... and we're seeing that I mean the ... got about six guys that can play right now and I use the word play um lately I mean there there there are guys that at least have experience but by no means they have anybody on this roster ... on the offensive are defensive line\nOr defensive front seven for that matter that has even in the neighborhood of all Big Ten discussion\nYeah no I mean ... maybe ... lower team guy just because he's going to finish with a ... but other than that there's nobody and I'm with you I mean I think you can go find the dude ... guy can come in and be a good defensive lineman for you an added depth AOL immediate ends packed freshmen guys\nOn defense options of mine is such a different story like you said\nAnd it ... it has to become part of your culture not only do you have to develop you have to recruited a high level and you have to do it for three to four years in a row to establish a foundation where you're not requiring\nSome Hugo guy to come in and be you're starting left tackle or a are relying on at a red shirt freshmen come in and be you're starting guard I mean those things aren't the makeup of a good Big Ten off and support line and so ... is right now\nAnd Wisconsin to set the bar and so it's going to take a long way before they're even save conversations Wisconsin\nAnd I feel like the the most elite lines typically are all seniors and juniors and a lot of times those\nThose lines are those players on those types of lines aren't seeing the field until their their junior or senior year so I it comes with recruiting or you can kinda\nGet their little faster or at least have some some patchwork with ... recruiting but you've got to get high school guys you have to develop them and and bring 'em up through the system so it may be three years until we see a line that that is drastically different than what we see right now\nSo sick on the theme of the Big Ten so outside of Nebraska in the next three years what school do you guys see that is on the decline or on the decline and on the\nRise I Would say on the rise for do um I I just think within the ... the division of the Big Ten west as long as Jeff from stays there and he has a quarterback in the wings coming up um I Do think produced gonna keep getting better with ...\nA show up in Lincoln and be the hardest working guy ... to earn respect from the current players on the team and to be a guy that they can count on to uh to really take a more to where they want to go I'm In and he's convinced extremely convincing when it when he was telling us that so\nUh I Do believe that the he has his priorities straight and he's really really matured a net and I don't know I never really got that sense from Greg bell and I'll say this I felt I feel like Egypt meals is more mature at this point than uh than maybe Greg bell was when I spoke to him during the recruiting process\nYou're listening here to the Oscar online shows we discuss or things that need solve this past weekend in Garden City watching several Oscar targets and ate a lot of offensive lineman on that field Nebraska on both sides you were watching I was central is well a couple of offered three offers out there on the line right in the in the game\nYeah three offers out of a too offensive lineman in that game and two in particular are a priority targets for Nebraska they give you got to start with bomb a deli all us any and I was just calling bam he he's he's from a London england\nUh he's got the accent is a former rugby player that just really started playing football here over the last three or four years um you know and I think that you know six eight three hundred and thirty two pounds he's uh maybe the biggest offensive lineman prospect that I've ever been able to to watch in person\nA and he's an impressive guy uh in in he's so big and powerful that he kinda he is dominant and and I don't know that there are too many people that can really test him so um and he's yet to reach us potentially\nBigger than you thought he'd be in\nPerson yes yeah a lot of times you know you see a guy listed the guy yet\nAnd it turns out to be you know six six or even six five and a half and it's like okay\nBut he was ... he was all of six eight and he was all of three hundred and three and a thick English accent yes um you know I mean he's and he's a character to 'em in and he is\nHe's one of those guys that is really I'm eager to to continue to to get better I mean he flat out said that you know I'm I'm nowhere near as good as as I Want to be or that I can be\nAnd I believe that and then and for me with a guy that has the the all the tools that he has it's going to take him being tested in playing against better competition for him to really take that next step forward and and coaching and whatnot and communicate\nWith a lot of coaches though that you know of no\nSee and that's the thing and that's why I think they're brats good may have a sneaky chance to to get him because he\nDoes not like the recruiting process he he doesn't totally understand that he's kind of freaked out by it um and so he lets his coaches handle his recruitment so when a college coach uh does actually get in contact with him he says\nA call coach Sims and and so he has coach Sims and that staff handle all of this recruitment and coach symbols ... as we just talk he's got a lot of ties to Nebraska so yeah the if you want to read the tea leaves here it looks like you know Nebraska could be benefiting from their relationship with coach Sims with a guy like\nA like ... so I'm now and the other side or the the main target that we were watching at Iowa central was Myron Cunningham who just landed an offer and he might have been the best overall offensive lineman\nThey're so he's better than ... ... ... fund more fundamentally sound and he's in early guy and he's an ... guy in band was supposed to graduate in December now he's graduating in may which is a big strike against him come on coach Sims ... guys out in December man a cause Nebraska this", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck
