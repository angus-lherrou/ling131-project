amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead it's forty three thirty six so right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at\nRight now a forty a four seats are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a two story six excuse me forty effect if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you couldn't get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came

safer than you did a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull off six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things past ah so\nYou know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could still lose it to they could easily still losing impossible but that level of between fifty and

and I don't care if they say well I'm a journalist I Know you're an employee and need to help the police with the investigation\nSo shut up trust me you got other things to whine about\nUm show there are a lot of people very very skeptical skeptical about this story including me\nBut at the same time I don't know uh I Know this I learned a long time ago that uh in most cases uh you never you don't even know the real story until weeks later when the investigation is finally concluded\nSo I Know there are a lot about flooded with emails from people that thinks is a bombing stuff\nUh that this is all fake and it's a false flag and I don't know if it is or not I know that it doesn't pass the Chris Baker smell test but at the same time who am I I'm just some idiot on the radio\nBut I Know this

out long before anybody else even started catching on like you were the first one I think this was like two and a half weeks ago or something like that\nThat said wait a minute who are these guys that are organizing all this and when we dug into it were like wow we just like a radical left is he's a radical leftists with ties to both ... and to a Raul Castro in Cuba\nAnd older people and the former a head of state for Honduras who was\nA surprise surprise uh Iraq Obama said was a coup well no it was the Supreme Court\nThat said of Honduras that said the president is is acting unconstitutional he is trying to change the constitution so we can have a military state under his rule\nSo the Supreme Court said\nArrest him and kick him out right that that's that's what happened that's what happened

us our to rise up in South America and\nRight and um yeah our American and they're going to have their own currency um I don't know about maybe military uh agreements would have problems possibly could have followed I mean they were big plans for this I also want to point out that one of the key observers you know how like an international and then also agreements trade agreements you have like he outside observer and\nI'm One of them their main one was Iran who was also a a an ally ally of Venezuela um keep that in mind that lay on this discussion when we talk about possible people who
