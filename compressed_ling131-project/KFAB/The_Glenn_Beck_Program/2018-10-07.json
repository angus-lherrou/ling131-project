Feinstein just friday just yesterday said are you just went down a litany of why Brett Kavanaugh should not be the guy\nAnd it had very little to do\nInterestingly very little to do with the allegations that she leaked or her office leaked about Christine Blasey Ford very little to do with that\nHer complaint was that she showed drew interrupting her interrupting other members and his anger you show that he doesn't know the temperament to be on the court that's being able to do with no\nHe doesn't have the temperament to be on the court oh by the way members on the left on that

doesn't matter you know when she\nWas going to and they're still going to write down I don't I don't have much time what's the question\nWhat do you think now we do that how are you do you think that what what would the impeachment process the like and what what ground so we have or in the school because that's all they talk about\nThe left will say it's obstruction of justice if they should win the house and they're willing to back away where\nThere was a big job for a while the bill claims bill claimed that he tried to do call me to not investigate the swimming be more bill so that he tried to obstruct justice to stop calling me know you look you and I agree he didn't do that but those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact impeach him and I think the Senate would would uh would find him not guilty so\nNothing would happen but that's the whole thing and it's a great question because the the voters of his country after ... if you vote for

[noise]\nOn the on the whole has it helped to more people or hurt more people\nHaving that conversation we are having it now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson\nA that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that that was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good doing months how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not talk about\nWhat capitalism a and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't come at this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we are talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show\nAnd and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about the Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having\nIn in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done ... work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean if you're going to ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night it was going to be no jak looted thug nobody's going to take you off to prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having these dumb proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I ... you know the big ideas are being trash the ideas of freedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense\nYeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise]\nMy my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in ...\nAnd I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believes and and the their their obligation infect\nTheir privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works full use sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system of pulled people by the billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your\nDo I'll absolutely so from Nineteen Seventy until today you know when when you when I were\nReally little kid um is that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on so it's really in the seventies that people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children and it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been eradicated no Seventy percent of Americans actually thinks that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page in the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not\nA news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of storage little poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me or through um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter you know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it\nAs Adam Smith lines out it can produce really bad things as well capitalism depends on the people who are willing or wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's got up to now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of all we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state Capitol around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people so she'll competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas fact is that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a frame democratic nation is very very important [noise] anybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people is not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas\nTo compete means to do it better than the other guy fairly peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and said that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back with the question I cannot find satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism however\nThere is it throughout history\nSome people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera they get so much money they have so much power that they are controlling things and it it just seems to spiral out of control when you have you know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating\nPeople through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you how do you make sure who's who can compete against Google\nHow are you going to do that how does that work when you get to that point and I like to hear your answer on that when we come back [noise]\nWeekdays at five thirty\nEaster join us for a brand new program were fired\nAbout the Pentagon ever wonder why we choose the stories we choose each day I Want to hear why that matters than I can live with that important case for why he discussed the thing that the mainstream media won't touch it was like it's your lucky day\nMy ... and the guys are are you a show then yes and why it matters we have right after you wanted more so you got in the news and why it matters weekday five thirty only in the blaze TV [noise]\nNews radio eleven to live in a way of a B ...\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty percent and trading was about two thousand dollars going ... from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto wrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but it was right it hit\nTwenty thousand dollars well now ... saying bitcoin could be up ten times or more by the end of this year that means it could hit forty thousand dollars by Christmas I Am a skeptic pot you need to understand\nWhat bitcoin is what crypto currency is and what are the triggers because this is a game changing technology and life changing investment even if you put a hundred dollars in bitcoin\nBut you have to educate yourself first do that by getting my exclusive Glenn Beck crypto course from Chico right now it's smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven ... back that's eight seven seven P.

two thousand nine or\nTwo thousand and it was a bit it's been nominees and so but it was common sense yeah yeah it's been a long time so this is lots of fun joined us grab your tickets Glenn Beck dot com slash to her okay back with a Arthur C Brooks he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute\nArthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good and none of this is good\nUm however ... we're not having\nAny one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has got a ride because we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is it's got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nIt isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill of rights by constitution guys like Glenn Beck and when you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and throwing good\nThe big problem is that there are too many people in the media and politics and entertainment in our polls campuses on the right and the left or ... or ... dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically out fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we were just really have to agree with him we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate it when they are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you're talking about the things that really bring us together\nAnd then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich by by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nI Know so I hear I hear it all the time so I'm On college campuses all the time that way not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears\nThat's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive and to say that their belief system is stupid that will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people\nIs to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these up social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it and then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship goes lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history\nIt's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say [noise]\nAnd now the problem is not that\nThis is an equal but what we haven't\nActually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden can you describe what that is\nYeah so I just have this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAnd part of this actually filmed in Denmark Denmark has considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a\nIt's a social democracy it has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government [noise] and so I went there I went to Denmark and hung out with some families there and the truth is\nIf you're into that you know more power to ya but I don't see very many people were actually trying to move to Denmark I Do see lots of people in Denmark that are trying to move to America why because of the antithesis culturally\nOf what it means to be an American that all you know Danish society Scandinavian society is built on the idea of don't stand out\nDon't be different don't think that you're something special don't try to do so if you're\nIn this country America is built by odd ball like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks we're due to actually tried to do different things and in Denmark if you [noise]\nYou know if you want to get rich or you want to start a company or you're really super religious like you and me or or you want to have eight kids forget about it but then to look at you like you're a freak and that's a big problem so if you want to socialism is not just a social deal\nSocialism is actually a cultural deal and so and and and basically where everybody has the same amount of money everybody has to be awake as well so if you like being a weirdo if you like being an odd ball if you like being yourself you better stay in America and you better make the American system better don't try to get the data system\nAnd that is one reason why it has been successful one reason why it is now falling apart and one reason why would not work here is there was no diversity there was no diversity now that they have open up the borders there's diversity and people don't want to live their life that way and it's falling apart my wrong people\nAre different people are different if look at the country of it's a boutique society a five point three million

completely discredited I think under any other president he would have just gone away discredited because they would have said you know what it's not worth it we don't believe those charges and he would have had no platform to defend themselves mhm\nDonald Trump is there one thing to say about him he is a fighter he does not give up and uh you know sometimes that's good sometimes that's bad it

the low fifties no temperatures are actually going to climb as we head into the evening in by tomorrow morning we could actually be close to sixty degrees\nYou be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring himself I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves\nBut that requires evidence that requires\nSome sort of of

looking for ... to ... uh to be righted somehow or another and it doesn't matter all men are guilty all men are guilty well I'm Sorry was gundy guilty was gundy guilty\nReally\n'cause he was a man was Martin Luther king was he guilty\nYou know that both of those men were flawed both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men or had been one was the alleged land or\nThe other was\nA clear racist gundy I still think they were great men they\nWere just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and do you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors when you go down that road\nAlways always end up killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying we should feed their genitals to the pigs\nTell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric and what a surprise once again it's coming from the elites in the universities\nIn\nBrooklyn that program\nIs really hard to really very very hard\nTo remain [noise]\nReasonable when the world is unreasonable

minds did we change\nDid we change the course\nTwo thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monster is saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you\nBecause I was so convinced I was right\n\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you were crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nSaw things a different way and as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions\nWhat amazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that foolish\nYou do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others\nPlease don't do that to others who say you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own

yea\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and you were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concern Oh yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know she gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself\nWas a serial rapist Oh thank you and stuff but the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not all the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr a or a or a a\nGeneral general attorney general would be a good one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's just a certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman a he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the capital case Neal is a case\nOf the capital case happens uh thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference blood a professor Ford she had a body memory\nYes you to very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we do not remember with Ford we have no even since that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and capital right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violence okay oh okay that really got both of those so the little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay what did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course well yeah\nAnd the words case they both have a notes from there do they do get around those cases are the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those\nTwo things one has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you though using meeting\nMe yeah and so she and you know and in one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being forced she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening the people Ford named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between the two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key thousands a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down\nUm including things like tax I'm writing um pictures and are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real time in\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had to Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that time yeah\nBut ... lives in I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nWell it was you got the tape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing that we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the ... and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we have I mean like we have any him out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alison case do however um\nWhat's interesting about this is that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume\nThat if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her 'cause she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's\nAn infinity amount times more evidence in the Alice in case\nHe had only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court if if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh that there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you\nIf there's amount on cabinet and I would yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same thing yeah [noise]\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be you can\nWant there isn't the legal standards because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times

anything for you if you haven't gone to the police and reported it\nIf you believe that we live in a rape culture then you have a responsibility to go to the police and document everything that has been done\nThen we as a society need to do everything we can to make sure that justice is served not on a collective basis but judging it by the individual case\nThat is a just society that is America\n[noise]\nListening to the going back program in one of my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary this out called the creepy line\nAnd that is exactly the right name for it [laughter]\nIt is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that Eric Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain an era Schmitz response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nDana he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yes it I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... uh and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google or has and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been they are more than just a company to make money or they have a certain the east coast and the world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's continue tied this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how for instance you know there's there's um a\n... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen\nThat right yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\n... one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand\nPeople around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results of the people were getting this is a very uh you know a clear academic study and and at this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton\nThey were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump and ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified\nBut the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it's secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming\nThe results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nGoogle is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's a real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this so it was\nIt was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about ... about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineer's saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppressed certain stories\nUm this is a thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general the whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed out in the open you have combat and by the way the fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of\nJesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you to vote a different way that wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why we'll you'd I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good at it it's not the name of the documentary is the creepy line the creepy line dot com Peter ... with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about\nInformation how do you know that it's true and we'll

producer of a new documentary that is out you find it at the\nCreepy line dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google\nThat you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line apps terrify deer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I Want to I Want to talk to you about the platform me I Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies are are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this where you've been doing here yeah and I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first to consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the ... the scope and the size that Google ... wait a minute how it is if the ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using a Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but is your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product\nBecause if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert up sign this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this is back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being that have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nLike there's this is just the beginning let me tell ya boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people that you just look it up for me please do how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy ... pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter] they had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the the system\nThe picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yeah city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million it's amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this this without AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to\nThat's right and and Google is at the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes\nI used to have a Gmail account now what ... does is they scan every email that comes into your Gmail accounts and ... ... email you send out you know what else they scan\nIf you ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what\nI don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft apps correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it's not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct is scanned by Google\nSo Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend or whatever the Google knows more about you than they do and they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy it's manipulation because they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers\nThey as part of their mission want to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nThere to be your choice or the ... documentary as the creepy line a couple of pushback and a couple of that sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of this one issue I have is Google is awesome and all of the products that they make are better than everybody else does", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Omaha", "day": "07"}
