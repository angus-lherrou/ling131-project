and he's running for governor of the state of New York and I think he is worth a serious look if you're a voter in New York\nI I have Fifteen minutes or ... it made me less now twelve minutes now scheduled with him but I'm hoping that he has more time because I think you're going to be fascinated by his story and I want to start at the beginning with him let's go to Larry sharp now hello Larry how are you\nAt Glenn how you doing good morning the morning or so I wanted to talk to you I'm really from the beginning if you have time to tell me the story of your life um because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood\nYour your dad was black your well your mom was white they weren't married he was in the sixties that's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't accept you is that how it started that's true okay tell me the story from there\nSure um I was born in Manhattan I'm as you as you said biracial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption so um my bicycle father was not in my life\nSo I don't know what he was thinking but that he wasn't in my life so I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was a ... who was my mother um was German\nAnd met my father who was black and the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx and that's why I was raised by a stadium\nAnd you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was raised this was not the best neighborhood um so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers um the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and worked in a bank\nShe then I left and we all we live together we we rate got enough money so we actually are packed up to ... when I was around eleven years old my father finally made enough money and my mother we worked hard to get that we got out of that the bad neighborhood he got to Long Island and when my ... my father died he died of cancer and when he passed away was very hard for my mom\nBecause how old were you I was a twelve okay so when my father died um my mother's down there was a Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family um abandoned us also so we were basically at all\nI'm at that point is very hard for myself and my mom of course as you could assume so by the time I was Seventeen I was ready to get out of here and I decided to get out and I thought you know what I'm gonna go off I'm going to join the army that's what I thought and I go join the army like my father would be like my dad and go join the army\nSo I go off to the recruiting station ... in this case they're all for recruiters in the same building and I go to the army recruiter and he tells me son has got to be great\nWe're gonna make you a general and and the moms that you're going to be you know probably in the world and beaten beautiful women and I'm Seventeen thinking my God this is going to be great\nI Walk out with all of that go army stuff in my arms and the book covers and still in high school at the time\nAnd he said and as I'm walking out the wrinkle recorded there that's arms folded and he says a song that I talk to you that you're going side he goes that army guy he promised you a lot didn't he I said yes I Am going to be a general\nAnd like one of the world's\nGoing to be amazing beautiful women and get a doctorate degree and three days can be awesome and he says yeah we call that the solar plant everything under the sun goes you know what am I promise you I said what he said for ... years\nAre you ready I said yes and I signed up\nAnd I look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing I was just reacting but what I look back at that I Know I was desperately seek seeking pause\nMale role models I didn't have and wrinkled gave me many of them and that was a a great thing and that the marine corps of the military is not everybody and not much to join but for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the time without the marine corps I Would have been a punk because I was lost at Seventeen completely lost in the marine corps helped me tremendously\nI'm when I got an a Marine Corps about seven years later [noise] um my mom had really gone into a very bad place um she couldn't handle me leaving she couldn't handle my father's death and she was addicted\nFirst illegal drugs and eventually illegal drugs and she was a victim of the drug war and she was a convicted felon\nSo I pulled her out of prison\nAnd I used my whatever things I had to try to get her back up and running a reading her an apartment in the house that I mean I'm I'm a car that kind of thing\nAnd she struggled and if you if you've had a felon in your life and you know hard it can be right they have that on the record and then they feel less then and then when they get a job there hostage to that job because they're afraid to do the job for them\nAnd it's just bad bad bad so I said you know what I'm gonna do something I've been taken actually my whole life and take action now too and we decided to start our own business I figured if we're in charge him with a ball says you can't fire sets it so we started on but we can't trucker so became we had a small trucking company\nWho what did you know about but what did you know about business nothing as a matter of God Bless America would it matter what it was with what I have a\nChoice I allow my mother to be hostage\nI Do something I what's my option go to business school was that what I was when I Do\nKnow right and that's what\nI Do often I don't I never I\nNever have and never will ever measure any plan I have against perfection because perfection doesn't work I measure my plan against status quo because that has caused what I have status quo was my mother as a hostage I don't accept status quo so we start business\nIt did well my my um it did well I actually left it let ... let her and my step dad run it and she ran until she retired\nAnd when she retired she did with too many New Yorkers do and that is leave New York state and she went to South Carolina to retire\nUm so she did that in ... and she was fine until she passed away several years ago\nBut after that that's when I went off to do my own thing I had made for jobs and then decided you know what the first visible successful let me try another one so I thought it my second business and that's when I actually uh that when I did not do well and that's why I say we're not that's when I first heard you back when

Gainesville boulevard a flood and a red Camaro and started driving toward Omaha the driver continued westbound onto the viaduct were stopped sticks were used to disable it after losing a tired the driver got out and ran but was quickly caught\nIt is that important even come in second would shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third\nYou better chance it would make better Democrats and better Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to worry about smaller government will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that will libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\nThere will be a massive\nA massive culture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire four years this is my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay for things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and\nWashington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government's\nNext that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with local governments now is they're enforcing the kings well so they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied\nAnd I don't want the government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what does that I don't know I Know I Know it's I'm not sure where he's an old ducked down due to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we throw it away awhile ago yeah [laughter]\nBut yeah that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met her individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community\nWe don't do that well in New York state it all we have things called we know economic economic development of corporations which Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent\nAnd opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow 'bout instead the county's can start to budget to zero\nSo they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one\nInstead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through lowering spending here's one idea that does both of those we have a bridge is right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial bridge named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that bridges named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain an apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass it up I'm\nGoing to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year a marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that's using the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area\nHundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang on just like a Texas New York's popular says Texas you listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but he has the best part now we have them do maintenance again we own it so we still we still inspect\nIt so damages though our responsibility their job is just repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now in New York state collapse we don't have enough money these guys do will have to have safer bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen\nDollars an hour if you're a truck\nDriver I Know a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge less money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we are running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is I mean this was selling Texas\nHow do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already seller\nBefore the Republicans and they all kept given up I mean they don't show up all the Democrats I think I'm afraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who

I Do have the um the temperament to be on the ... a team however all you know ... I can jump right into that\nRole oh you're dead dogs have that they spent on fifth teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how they look it's it's certainly on its own this is their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court said for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like well what it what it does say\nWhen it does say is that it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his anger when he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I Know what I'm saying even reached further I Know if he would've come on and he would not have been angry\nI would've thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly I did not have sexual relations with that ... thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful unless\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here's my levy to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would\nHave done it no other president in my lifetime would have stuck stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise]\nBe\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWith that being said\nAnd I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those ... charges turned out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in like a she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing\nNew or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out and this FBI there they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was and I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that's by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say you know he he\nYou know quit or vote went down all went down in ... ran down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely\nBecause you don't need how long\nDid they do take the due to the ... sessions of uh uh I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighty was the vote went down so let it for weeks and three or four weeks for an hour we could have probably could have a fast rate other things going on um\nCase so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks\nThe one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that\nIs likely it's already been done he's the only under get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another Senator Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list ts so so you've got you've got Mike ... you could select him\nLet's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow [laughter] which I wouldn't\nStrange accident but it could happen and it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy who they were fighting on the ... yeah I mean was turning around if that happens to Kevin\nWell this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering ah [noise] the New York times are playing but anyway so let's just say and it makes him and his opposite ...\nUh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate\nWe're going to have this done by the election\nThere of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... ... pro life\nUh and he would vote a ... the bottom line is he cares about the constitution that anything I mean who will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough for here's Mike Lee\nThere's not going to be there is no drinking parties would likely there's just no drinking part maybe and it'll be like Mike is like\nAll right I Confess I I tasted beer in Nineteen eighty three I didn't really like it when I tried it wasn't root beer have you made it very clear to me [laughter] ah so anyway\nHe's the only one that you could push through because\nIf you don't if you don't have a plan immediately\nThen the Democratic plan works of delay\nYet that and that's the most important point their strategy is not to say that Kavanaugh is a sexual abuse or their strategy is not to say anything about Kavanaugh specifically their strategies to delayed this thing so they can get to the election and if they get past the new Senate coming in\nThey can potentially have a chance of stopping now if you were to the day after the um the did after this goes down God Forbid you know would they find something terrorists have let's say they found something terrible man right and everybody agrees and it goes down eighty to twenty right like it's just one of those things they found something terrible though\nAbout having a we don't think that's going to happen however you must be prepared for that potentially out you have to be ready for it\nAnd if a if you tried to go down and then the other suggested road who we talked a little bit about yesterday\nWhich was you know a Diane Sykes or you know an Alison either one of the other will make it to January ... ... you could potentially happen of time before the seat the Senate\nBut I mean it's going to be really close and you might not make it really is the only thing you'd have that you'd have be able to get that through fascinate also is the guy that everybody in the Senate has to look at it after they voted against\nI mean they will vote against it but Democrats will still do it but we'll we'll Jeff Flake vote against you know a highly I don't think so would a I think so you know I mean you know I don't know have good relationships with Lee even though they know they think he's gas survey for for\nThem and remember it's advise and consent and now I Know the Democrats won't care about that but there's a chance you can get all of the Republicans on board if you don't\nPaul the sick arrives at Kennedy international airport in New York City the

move the goalpost and now the goal posts are moving the goalposts now our duty perjured himself did he lie under oath\nAnd not about not about a a professor forward but about what\nWas written in his ear book ... so here are the things that they are saying and and you have to say ... ... is this\nWould this rise to the level of perjury All right go ahead\nAnd I I Want to warn you we're about to use highly technical medical terms and if you are this maybe go a little bit over your head that's OK stick with us okay judge Kavanaugh's yearbook page included the entries judge have you both to yet\n\nHave you moved and devil's triangle\nThursday he said booth meant flatulence and that the devil's triangle was drinking game in which three glasses were arranged in a triangle\nUm this is disputed according to the New York times and I want to make sure that you understand that I'm reading from a from what is supposedly the greatest newspaper ever created they are they're talking about whether the word ... means flatulence or not [noise] both in the Nineteen\nEighties was a term that often referred to um [noise] ... well it can technical terms anal sex and this is how judge Kavanaugh's classmates said they interpreted his comment they said they had never used it before as referred to flatulence okay\nNow the term ... Glenn was a term that I Do remember from my from my I Would say elementary school days oh ... oh well you know that was before ... maybe I mean it was like I don't think I necessarily knew what it meant but I feel like it had a sexual connotation to it\nHow or when I found it interesting is as I was telling him talking to you about this this morning before the show and assuming that everyone would understand that is what it meant you had a totally different understanding of the word\nWell I wasn't the hip is so new [laughter] so I don't know if you have that but I I seem to remember is something that I don't recall but I think we used to you know getting stoned\nOr something I I I Can't remember the words are who've meant getting your style or getting stone something like that maybe okay I I Lived in I Believe ... yeah\nI was in Richmond high yeah maybe I mean it's been a little um die right okay\nAh but ah I looked it up in the Urban Dictionary OK okay because it is I mean this is as close as you can come yeah like a founding document of the word booth yeah this is like if you go back to the federalist papers out yet very Urban Dictionary [laughter]\nOkay so this is a the Urban Dictionary right to abuse any list it's or illicit substance via insertion into one's rectum\nThat the number one meaning but that's the number one I have never heard of that\nBought funneling oh now\nI Know I get ... technical terms I don't know who says you know what a bad it's better if we drink beer through our mutt\nBut apparently that's been done a [laughter] I\nDidn't I didn't know you kind of I Know you can do that either is it and I don't recommend and it's not called really drinking if you do it that way now is really learning here nothing no I don't know if you're\nIf you have bought blackouts if you know it was on your butt falls on an asteroid or not or okay okay so there's a there's the there's the the number one a ... or the next one is something that is whack\nDumb or F up\nUsed to describe objects people or stuff you don't want to do\nSo that uh you know that guy's a booth yeah that I feel like that's maybe also how I heard it now that you're saying it that way but it's just kinda like an insult yeah that may have been yeah right\nI just know I remember the word but I don't remember him connected to you know sticking things into [laughter] anyway ah here's one that kind of makes me feel a little better a synonym for weed\nOkay yeah so how would it is there a sense of smell use it in a sentence place smells that booth [laughter]\nNow I assume that da da is what you're saying yeah smells that boom yeah yeah yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable\nFifth V. active lifting the uh the bow out of a whitewater kayak well going over rocks waves are waterfalls like uh in order to launch over hydraulics or rocks\nThis entry sponsored by ... yeah that's what I've never heard that before\nI Move the low tones noise a dog may okay typically when they are suspicious or unsure of whether they should actually\nBark or not I haven't heard a flatulence one but I have heard many things related to the bought a which I think somewhat another term for having sex\nIt that'd be in the bud Bob [laughter]\nSo I felt I again [laughter] I think this is the interesting point here they're trying to say this is essentially perjury\nThere's no way that's perjury to me that is a bonkers claim the idea that did that word probably meant different things to different schools as as mine and yours did right as there are seven different definitions on Urban Dictionary for it now not just because flatulence didn't make it there does that mean that low locally ... that was not the way people used it\nBut you do have the problem of people in Georgetown Prep now starting to come out and saying look I I was for him and I don't think he did this for a good thing\nBut\nNow that he was saying that this is what these words mean come on man and and that he was
