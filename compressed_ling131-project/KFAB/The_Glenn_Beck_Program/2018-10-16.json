studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we are going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just it says this is this an act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce they're determined how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means faced\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the re privileged classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being completed\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step\nFrom what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claim for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um he does the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nHim interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nAll events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom he got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo that if I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working and social justice\nSize field topics courses I guess the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general\nBut stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe of journal in education and this was the gold standard feminists philosophy journal hype Asia\nThat we were working with here which is where a lot of the literature this like this already exists\nWhich you don't mind me going on a little bit this this kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering they're called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just\nOpinion some of them are prejudice some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing and then they launder them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've base this program on studies that show\nWell that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies are coming

brought the states together in the first place the state's said we don't want the big states\nLing us what we can do and if the big states can a control everything well then ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you\nHave New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter there will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right I might have\nTo do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this is an idea that I'm In it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind\nBut uh there is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean that you know it'd be which it may not want that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way ... cities should\nRun themselves in the city is going to run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nI ... the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the truth out\nRight and it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly\nSo things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed\nQuickly then the next the the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for wrecked trying I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the\nPresident is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas like no that's the U.S is this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several or even around me give you the argument for a king\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] uh no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure park right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane absolutely insane\nAll right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland\nMayor who the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but\nI I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... last week\nThe Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ...\nCan anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and they just can I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially with a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] ... what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chase him down\nNothing\nNothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how\nHow can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any\nWorse he's trying to make it sound as if um\nThe police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right\nThey they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's so they have no way to win it's a

O. dot U. K. I I'm not sure that this I'm not sure that Michael wasn't joking and part of this\nJust give you the highlights Michael blaze officially retired from music following his sons no ... is following his son Noah's cancer battle the singer forty three explained the heartache he endured following his son's cancer diagnosis as at just three years old has changed the perception of life\nAnd he is done now with fame with a new album out a title love on the way he explained that this is time for him to step away from music wanting to leave it at the very top after making the perfect record Michael revealed his decision to quit the industry in what he claimed to be his last\nInterview my whole bean has changed since my son got cancer he said Michael ... says he was embarrassed to realize how he ... he had become as he nursed is ... Noah back to health but now he's got his mojo back\nThe Canadian singer has won four Grammys sold Seventy five million records earning I'm thirty five million dollars a year or he has been married to a stunning Argentina and model an actress\nFor seven years to ... live the life of luxury in the street with her three children know of five Elias too and daughter video ... Betty Who is eleven weeks old yet all of this seemed meaningless when Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago\nAnd the devastated couple immediately announced that they were putting their careers on hold for the care of their son Noah has been declared now cancer free\nI'm Michael ... is very emotional his brown eyes swell up at the mere mention of the C word cancer there's too many see where it's now\nAnd it is clear he is living in the shadow of what he describes his two years of hell you just want to die he said I don't I don't even know how I was breathing my uh my wife was the same and even though I was a stronger of the two of us I wasn't strong my wife was\nI'm Sorry I Can't make it to the end of the settings let's just say we find out who we are with these things\nGoing through this with Noah I didn't I didn't question who I was I just question everything else why are we here is this all there is because if this was all there is there has to be something bigger\nHe says that one way he got through was to pretend he was in ... ah a Roberto I'm a ... a character from life is beautiful\nI don't know if that was a choice he said but that's why I became for instance I never called at the hospital I called it the ... hotel\nUm he said every day I got extra bed sheets that I Would build a tent for Noah I just made the best of it\nIt's such a difficult exercise it hurts me and it hurts to talk about no up because it's not my story to tell it's his but my whole life has changed my perception of life\nI don't even know if I could get through this conversation without crying and I never lost control of my emotions before in public I actually thought I'd never come back to the music business I never fell out of love with music I just needed to put it aside\nIt was hard was going to the store and buy hotdogs and toilet paper and going to the gas station going for a walk by the sea to clear my head everyone recognizes me and says how's your son you think you're close to getting over it and you're stuck right back into it but at the same time I was given back my faith in humanity\nUm he said uh the illness made him realize he needed to make a change in his life\nI spent a good a time a good deal of time with people who aren't so lucky this terrible news came I realized I wasn't really having fun in the music business I had lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is it had been a while since I had been having fun\nIt started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was old blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\n[noise] I was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realized that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThan I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\n\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I'd become so anxious there were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that if you've written do better song tickets might be selling quicker\nI started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility it's just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was since insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish\nIt affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is\nFascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael ... was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage\nIs that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is a it is so in fact she was yeah he loves it\nI mean you can tell when you and you see him live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it\nThe staff followed him to the parking lot where he walked around confused eventually he walked to punt Arab bread\nAnd then through the parking lot along the street\nEventually police showed up and took the dining dash or in to catch city after the after over two years of walking the checks he's now going to walk the line yeah All right\nI'm going to allow that thank you I made it up myself I got sick of reading this thing [laughter] so let me

New Mexico and Colombia Colombia\nYes well way and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood is not even what they tested\nOr and even that is it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years he would not show the hit Canadian blood\nType like that's not the only thing they did it oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian DNA does is it shows a lineage again shows it's it can be interesting in some way\nMigration patterns and I wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic\nThan a Robin friends disorder or [laughter] that's true it probably would show that uh but so it's interesting\nYou know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was\nIt was her great great great great grandmother I think a several generations back and um when she registers in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the born a campaign and and and then this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that number\nOne obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but what have we learned from aggressive\nHave learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not\nThat was what I was not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to\nAccept that she is so we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just ...
