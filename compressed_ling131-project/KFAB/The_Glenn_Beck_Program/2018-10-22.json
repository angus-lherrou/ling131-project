I'm not sure about their options but their defense is really good\nAh that's in and of course of Ohio State local how states not going away they can still win the division that they went out\nBut the fact that these guys looked at it and said okay here's our scheme that says to me Sean this staff can win games and the Big Ten\nFor and that's the difference of running this type of a system versus say a pro style which is very generic and you've got to have a leak pro level guys to make it run at that level\nGo gun to gun with the top teams in the country for this system and we do in a very into the system\nYou know outflank announced strategize the great urban Meyer and and and and and a lot of ways Scott ...

F. A. B. hon I highly radio ...\nActually can be only fair exchange\nHave that kind of energy in a full stadium the fans are incredible I Can't tell you how much I appreciate and they've been so supportive you're going through all this and I think in the vast vast majority of the some of the stroke was going through it can also see the improvement and can see where this is going in every single one of the districts commented on it\nAnd both the direction they can see this football fan for going in the unbelievable support [noise]\nUm if it's this way right now I Can't wait to see at once you get this thing wrong there's going to be a lot of fun and that's why\n... such a cool part of the story or Nebraska or go to Scott Frost is just look up such that algae recruiting\nUh you know and I think Rosie yours on our generals back and rush brunch more of the electronics department Monday Night quarterback show I bought last week\nWe talked about a week ago tonight but I thought the real press opposed to this program was on the season was on was how do you keep these guys from going into the tent after what happened in northwestern that was a good coaching job I think so that was I Am I ...\nThink so you know the defensive a performance on Saturday or was not as good as the opposite to perform as just a pure execution but\nYou know the guys may plays in the red zone\nOr against a pretty good officer football team and they did a nice job on on a ... and they did a nice job on their other guys you know there's some other southern Wisconsin or birds got so the Minnesota receivers made some circus catches\nUp again I I didn't exactly antics dead as a division one quarterback but I think the backup ... Morgan is so he would want to have a great job\nBut they they just you know they play with a lot of heart and I I got to tell you Gary he's not going to be all conference\nOr he's never going to be considered one of the best players that his position probably not even in the first one or two cuts but Mohammed Barry is a really positive ... out of this team this year he makes plays the at eleven tackles\nHe's got a great attitude an unbelievably healthy attitude and that is really critical with young lawyers and Aaron Williams turned around and he had a better game you talk about somebody that could have gone off the cliff after that north western game he did go walk I live in the western game\nBut his coaching a mentors there and I suspect his teammates and I'm going to throw\nMohammed burying there they said look we're going we're going to need you we need you to forget about that game we need you to start doing some things right uh we need you to play like you're capable and he did he responded so\n'cause you're not you 'cause you're not here for not you're not here are like madly now and now that flag on gun in your head and I think you're right I think the leadership on that squad out and certainly the coaches here's ... heard at another good game how they handle this a sex scandal losing strict\n... it was important through that that the players and in the U.S change I don't think that's very good leadership to get them all fired up about this is the way we're going to do things boys into a couple of things go the wrong way and then we change I got a lot of really good men that I work with a trust them they've been doing the right thing the whole time and\nIt was just a matter of time before that lead to good results but having a having the whole staff calm and guys that I trust in that I Know can do the jogging I seem to jogging for 'em\nNow gave me some peace of mind that I knew were moving right direction and we still got a long way to go but I Know we're moving in the right direction\nHe could lose his officers coordinator in the next two years I didn't try Walters will probably be the next Nebraska assistant coach to become a head coach probably at the F. C. S. level right away but he'll have his jail because you know he's the architect of this off and seeing what they've done at Central Florida it's a really attractive outfits for athletics directors or try to sell tickets [laughter]\nSo ah I I think he's got some good people around them I Believe that I I was a little\nAs I said a week ago Gary if Scott Ross believes in these guys I Believe in these guys are but they have some work to do they have to prove that they can scheme against the elite coaches and the Big Ten has a few of them\nAnd I don't know the PGA flex one of them yet he might be he certainly was he was the Scott frosted mirrors and ah but we'll see you know ... we'll see what happens I I think we should have some success against but they're cutting in and then you know let's see what happens in these November ... uh\nBut I have bad news is Ohio State as idol this week yeah now is because they're going to be ... urban is going to be beaten they got ... I like that and take that out on somebody else's Saturday instead of idle\nWhether they got people uh Internet games and eleven AM game which is also good for us you know it's not up to thirty or seven o'clock and\nI just I just came away really pleased about how the guys played the game not perfect but we saw some guys emerge you know Ben Stiller we I I\nI said it last week I\nWhat is the staff going to do with the ... and the ... and these younger guys are that are that are still developing as players they are not the finished product that they're going to be the senior guys are but these guys are what are they going to do with Damian Daniels you know they're going to turn Damien Daniels into that\nThat that hangs in the middle of the defensive line ... takes up to blockers on everything yes [laughter]\nOh that's ... that's exciting stuff and I I really believe that you're going to see and improve football team every week the rest of the way doesn't mean they're going to win every game 'cause these guys known now hey there is a method to this\nWe've proven that if we do it right we can move the ball stick it in the end zone stop the other guy so I'm happy about that I I look at the rescue fans they're not happy about the season because you want to win nine ten eleven twelve ball games here every year but\nYou know I Would think that now has gr fans you know ... uh yeah yeah I'm looking for Duke and go in there\nBut I was I can be no as a ... a beat them then you can beat the I don't know at Michigan State and and the Iowa Michigan State I don't know where you know unless you can date at\nHome was just very mediocre offensively Iowa is a good football team they they do their thing well in late Stanley is extremely underrated a that's a good football team but they they've got one last in this conference already they've got some tough public it's gotten\nSo I wouldn't be surprised if the winter the west division as to losses\nOr they could absolutely have to losses and then we got that Fifteen page tie breaker that we get along I I don't know uh but I never ask a I Love ... and then in the November ... him and it does help that you didn't want to go in a restaurant a game I was like ... yeah\nI mean the people up in Minnesota or to go what the hell they're averaging allowing forty points in Big Ten games uh [noise] they I think they have but now they lost their best\nDefensive player earlier in the season when field to an injury everybody has injuries so that's not really an excuse the brass did a great job\nOn a on their top guys although cash min he's going to play in the NFL he's at ... good for McBride cast moving good football earlier or they did a good job on their top guys but Minnesota is still like I said it's a six year rebuild\nOr they can't go heavy you go up there if he's lucky he'll get one or two Jews goes admitted and the ... goes that he wants are not typically ones that are a question mark academically\nOr what I won't get out and they won't get it up there um and I ... and he's somehow he just got to do this and I don't know how he does because he's sitting in the middle of a pro sports market\nHe has got to keep the best Minnesota kids at home and he's losing Minnesota kids left in the top two kids are not going to the you I'm\nAn up there there are a lot of talent they play a lot of different sports but in order for him to build this program and I think they've made some guys better which is pretty critical and if you're a Minnesota person if you're a Big Ten west person you observe this\nYou're thinking he's got to find a way to keep the top five or six Minnesota ... at home every\nYear I can tell I can just tell you this gym from just from my perspective having grown up there in a different time [noise] ah there was a time although go for football is never as huge as Nebraska football is here but it was ... it was it was back to this extent\nOr if you were a kid growing up there and you of em came to want you to play form you'd want to go there that was that was kind of a dream I don't think it is anymore it isn't a hurt too for too many of these they've\nToo many ... you see it I mean they lose so many kids or to other places like the starting Potter for old men\nThey will and the twenty ... and\nAnd I have a nine other ... joined the nine hundred when club University in Nebraska that's pretty rare air\nWho have done the who's a nine hundred Notre Dame Michigan and a Texas yeah there are men are going to measure Alabama's not\nTheir Ohio State is close I think\nOklahoma's close but I don't know that there there are that that'd be fun I got to be hard luck Iowa\nIowa is good football team they are physical ... their defense either real I mean in there at home\nUh but that is a real defense over there you got to give those guys props uh Ohio State is going to be a load [laughter] as they did not play very well on Saturday but this is a coach who's won three national titles um\nHe's got a staff of people who know what they're doing\nA and they're going to be at home against us they're going to get a week off to do in this we're gonna have to play a game that maybe we have an imagined in order to stay in that when they still have a ton of material they've got that winning mo Jo it's a hundred and four thousand people are there the horse\nShoes I mean if you're absolutely you want to be I can absolutely you on a plan to win the unrealistic\nI think this team and score with anybody you know we keep apparently around like we did this week defense oh okay oh here's the nine hundred women club Michigan Ohio State and Texas and Ohio State in Texas just joined it this year I'm Michigan was the only one sort of brass disclosed that just a nice that'd be nice for when we got\nThe eight hundred that was a really that was a terrific accomplishment it speaks to the tradition of the program that dates back long before all of us were alive a but in Nebraska has always love this game and we talked about this prior to a point where nobody wants to hear it at our that culturally there is no better place on earth\nFor college football to be popular than the state of Nebraska the game of football is a reflection of us look Nebraska's are hardy people they are hard working people they are community people they are willing to do the top stuff\nTo be successful and football is a tough sport college football football in general is a tough sport only tough people can play this gas to a game for Last Boy really yeah but if you look at those early Nebraska team and those were farm kids who loved\nHeavy equipment on their own they they busted side on their own and that was the start of a cultural match and that's why the\nYou know frankly when ... came in here and we needed a culture change and then Harvey started getting involved where he had no business and and along come Sean I course do as a ... he was an agenda too and he hired a guy who had\nNo business being there there's more to the culture thing here than anywhere I understand\nA pair of Nebraska natives would decide we need a culture change",
