today your gifts and prayers help the Lutheran our brain Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church thank you for your fate full support now here is Dr Oswald Hoffman\nPeople say religion has nothing to do with real life maybe not but faced does faith in God is real life\nPeople will say faith in God is not as much use until you are in trouble maybe so if you're talking about that religious feeling that comes over people and make them say pious teams when someone is taking to the hospital or someone as they say passes away\nFaith in God however is not just the religious feelings or pious words\nIt is knowing God having confidence in God trusting God expecting guard to do his thing come good days are back\nGod is good for the good days and he is good for the bad days garnish strong on the successful days and strong on the unsuccessful day's gone is our refuge and strength and very presence help in trouble said disarming\nIt must have been a day of dark for boating and bitter struggle\nWhen the ... wrote God is a refuge and strength and very present help in trouble therefore we're not we fear though the earth be removed and do the mountains be carried into the midst of the seat those are the waters there up war and be trouble\nThe mountain shake with the swelling they're up it was a day of dark for boating and bitter struggle when Martin Luther used to say to his treasured friend Philip Langston comes at a letter\nSaying the forty six out of one of those occasions that is said grew that great him I finished the book is wins or go out and go to their\nWhen a mighty fortress is our God the shield and weapons to defend\nThe theme of both to some and the him is we will not fear we may ... skew and worry ourselves\nInto gray hair out serious high blood pressure heart attacks and possibly a lot of other things\nWe may prepare for ourselves premature coffins in grapes for getting the one who can make everything different for every one in this wide world of ours but there's always got no matter what may come there's all was God it's always possible that faith in him no matter how dark the day or how bleak future\nSimply because he is God God is already huge and strength American president help in trouble therefore we're not we fear\nDo the right to be removed and do the mountains be carried into the midst of this see\nWhat kind of talk is dead anyway when we're surrounded by all kinds of possibilities that strike fear into the hearts of people and even terrify them to death\nWith all the other fears there's always the fear of death\nIt hard to people from the cradle to the grave children are afraid of death and so are their parents\nIn fact one of the great fears of children is that their parents will die or that they will go away and not return or they would break up with one another and rent a beautiful little family or something will happen that will bring about change which almost always produce his peers in children\nJust as it does in older people all the fears are really members of the one fear the fear of death\nThat explains why people don't like to talk about that what they talk about it they tried to make it seem present when they know otherwise\nThe Bible does not blink at talk of dead it faces death with a clear I call that an enemy talk about change that changes everything it changes things for people who die and it changes things for people who are left behind\nFear is a fact of life is not all bad it keeps a child who is burned his finger on the stove from doing it again fear it keeps us from all sorts of ration reckless actions\nFeared drives people to see the doctor or keep people from going to see the doctor for fear of what he will tell them they pretend that the pain isn't there are they act as if it will soon disappear\nFear can be a gift from God it can wake you up they can jog your loose from your complacency it can turn you from fiction the fact it can bring you back to reality but fear will never make a strong it takes something else to make a strong faith makes\nPeople was wrong not any old kind of fate that faith in God that is for real it's not just a big feeling about God\nBut actual fate confidence and got crushed and God even closeness to guard which is more than ... piety because it is a deeply felt conviction on which you bank your life that pain when did this faith in God\nContrary to what some people say and think faith does not eliminate fear faith in God Shakespeare and channels it in the right direction fear destroys and face saves\nFace saves people my overcoming the frenzy of fear which is unhealthy and destructive turning the face of fear in the right direction which is called God\nFace turns people away from themselves toward God it may sound unrealistic and foolish to some people but actually it's the only real an intelligent way to live\nI Wish I could tell you how often I prayed with people were scared to death\nAs someone close to them was being carried into a hospital unconscious and placed into the intensive care unit hovering between life and death the whole family stood around in the horn way young and old not knowing which way to turn all kinds of fears were all over the place\nAnd we prayed to God quietly and confidence altogether\nYou have to experience something like this to feel the piece that settles on that same fears may still be there but they are no longer in control something else has taken their place faced takes over and people put their fears into the hands of God\nThat's not just the religious feelings are pious talk when fear is so thick that you can cut it with a knife face cuts through and then there's light to again no matter what may happen there is gone where God is no fear\nGarters are refuge and strings very president help trouble therefore we're not we fear though\nThere be removed and do the mountains be carried into the mix of the sea\nFaith in God hunter says fear and pointed in the right direction the direction is toward God fear of God becomes a healthy thing when you have faith in God with faith in God and a godly fear that goes very well with faith\nPeople begin to see things again with a clear I entered take things with a clear mind it's a good thing to fear the devil but you've got to know where he's at\nWith faith in God you know where he's at the great thing about God is that he shows us where he's at where the devil is at and where we are at in relation to God and to all the forces which arise to deceive into trouble lost the great God sent his son Jesus Christ into the world\nHe rented came the story is there for all they hear all to read all to see their mysteries about God that none of us understands\nAnd mysteries about Christ that nobody can explain but there's no mystery about who Christ is and what price did there's no mystery about who Christ is and what he is always doing he died for the sins of the whole world it did that for all of us\nThat's gone doing his thing and his son Jesus Christ\nFor the sake of his son the great guard for gives the sins of our humanity whatever they are ... give us some all he does this for the sake of his son who died for us as a sure sign that God forgives\nThe great God raised his son from the dead and gave him an name above every name that at the name of Jesus every

is not content just to say nice things about God and about Christ but actually ... the need before him it takes place to see yourself both as a saint and sitting there in the site of God said by faith in God's great hot\nAnd moved into the right direction by a holy fear of God which is true recognition of your own humanity along with love for God which has plenty of room for hold some all of\nHis sovereign power and his overwhelming grace all of which you said in his son Jesus Christ\nFaith in God that he is truly a father intent as a father on saving your rather than destroying you\nProduced
