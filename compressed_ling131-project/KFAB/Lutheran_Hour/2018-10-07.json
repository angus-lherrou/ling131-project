{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "Oh my do [noise]\nWe'll also hear from Tara Leonhardt an Ashton hard hello I'm Mark ... thanks for joining us today your gifts and prayers help Lutheran our brand Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church thank you for your faith full support\nThe Reverend Gary Hart is pastor of vessel Lutheran Church in Kitchener, Ontario now with a message titled\nGod created here's pastor hard\nGrace mercy and peace began to you from your lord and savior Jesus Christ or certain insects for today is found in the beginning of scripture genesis chapter one verse twenty seven so God\nCreated man in his own image in the image of God he created him male and female he created them let us pray\nAlmighty God heavenly father your generous goodness comes to us new every day\nBy the work of your spirit you lead us to acknowledge you're getting is to give thanks for your benefits\nAnd to serve you and willing to ... help us to see the world as you see it just the others and remember that they too are your ... children\nGive us the courage to see your hand in all people in the farmer the migrant worker the store clerk the butcher the Baker the refugee the c._e._o. the politician\nThat yet to be born and then all of those whose work makes it possible for us to gather here today to sit\nAt your feet in your word less us and keep everyone in your care through your son Jesus Christ star lord on that\nIt's right there at the start of history the start of it all the genesis as it were\nIn the beginning God created that is\nOur heavenly father will to create to give a life where none existed or exists it's there where God for nothing brings everything into being you know the history you've heard it many times before from darkness comes light\nThan water then land than vegetation than sun and moon and stars\nThen see life followed by life on land\nWe see God's handiwork bringing life into its very first existence and God made the beef up the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds and everything that creates on the ground according to its kind and God's saw that it was good\nThis accounts alone would be a magnificent event to watch ethics for sure\nBut God wasn't done\nHis crowning achievement was still to come then God said let us make man in our image after our likeness again God brings to life that which never was it's the creator the one who is life bringing into life or is it begins first with one man\nThan being the loving father seeing how sad man is with not having a fitting partner he puts man to sleep and takes from the man a red and from it\nMakes a woman than the man said this that lasted bone in my bones and flush of my flash she shall be\nCalled woman because she was taken out of man here it is where to become one again Adam is completed as his wife who was made from his side is at his side again\nAnd God Bless them\nAnd God said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth\nThe giver of life now gifts the couple with the ability to create more of what God loves so much and let's not misunderstand\nHas even though man and woman have the ability to create a life together is only one God gifts that to them\nThat all life is actually created he is lord\nAfter all [noise] so we're once no\nLights existed now life in many forms exists today and God's crowning achievement that of mankind has since grown to over seven billion people in such a huge number it is hard to not feel a little in significant\nI think families who are blessed with three four five or ten children and how some of the siblings feel as if they aren't even noticed among many others in their own home vying for the attention of their parents and as a parent it can be challenging to give equal amounts of time to each child\nSome demand more than others and it isn't wrong\nIt just is what it is\nThat said though our heavenly father has no such limitations no he is greater and he has kept a watchful eye on his entire creation and each individual he's created with the attention is if we were the only one on earth\nBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you says God each life before even coming into existence God has cast his gaze upon\nDelighting in having us hear his voice and that we would be led home to him\nNow if you don't know the story it isn't only about the good stuff\nNo there is the part where death entered where God had created so much life\nGod's enemy the devil the great liar and deceive her chained to destroy that which God loves the most you see the devil cannot be God Newark take his place in fact when the devil tried\nGod banished him and send him away from the heavenly places hating God as the devil does though knowing his powerless a beating God one on one the devil targets God's crowning achievement seeking to hurt God by hurting those he loves\nJust as he did with the first man and woman in the garden the devil continues telling lies that we can be like God creators of our own destiny is that we should focus on what we want and try to get it at any cost don't worry be happy for that is what you see you can trust\nMe I can show you how to get it once created in the image of God our lives got twisted and turned upside down and where once we walked with God now are natural inclination is to walk to the beat of our own drum\nWhere it before we would have seen the value in every one who was created in God's image\nWe now see them as a means to Iran's obstacles to our goals or simply inconveniences wars now exist among people's tribes and nations as we seek to get our own wants Matt\nWe may lie and cheat or speak poorly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we have placed the lives of others over we may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value than those born typical maybe we think\nThere must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way we'd be wrong that disciples were so you'd be in good company\nAnd the gospel of John we recall the account of where Jesus killed the blind beggar\nIn their travels de Jesus and the disciples pass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth and his disciples asked him rabbi who send this man or his parents that she was born blind\nAnd Jesus answered it was not that this man's sand or his parents but that the works that God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking\nFor this man had a God given purpose when life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift we may see it as merely inconvenient\nNot worthy of having right now has this new life is it in a way of the plans we have made for ourselves throughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year\nThe arguments for abortion range from not wanting to raise children with birth defects to those concede due to rape\nYet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion\nTwisted in the devils lives as we are we may no longer see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting\nSin has caused us to become towel a sub scene in life as having great value from the one who gives it did as we are in our sinfulness we place a little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly said it\nWould be good could bringing a disabled child into this world possibly bring what purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring chair for a long time\nStripping them of their ability to be active citizen [noise] even though it was my\nThe actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour",
