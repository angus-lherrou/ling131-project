prayers help the Lutheran our bring Christ to the nations and the nation's to the church thank you for your faithful support today's messages based on Romans chapter three versus nine through Thirteen now here's doctor Michaels they color\nOr reading from Romans chapter three now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those under the law so that every mouth would be stopped and the whole world held accountable to God\nYou see no human being will be declared to be in the right on the\nBasis of the works of the law but rather frugal law we come to know our sin but now\nA writer standing with God has been revealed apart from the law although the law and the profits bear witness to it this right standing comes into effect through the faithfulness of Jesus\nFor everyone everyone who trusts you see there is no distinction there is no difference\nAll have sin and are falling short of God's glory and yet\nAnd yet as a free gift by God's Grace they are declared to be in the right through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus God's what Jesus forward in the place of mercy through faith by his blood\nGod did it to demonstrate that he is in the right to passing over since from beforehand in God's patients got did it to demonstrate that he used in the right now in this present time and for him to declare to be in the right\nThe one who trust in the face on this of Jesus\nWhat becomes of our boasting than it is excluded by what sort of law of works know by the law a face for we hold that one is justified by face apart from the works for the law\nLet us pray father almighty maker of heaven and earth\nYou give and you take away blessed to be your name into the age of the ages to face in your\nCrucified in ... son Jesus you have put things right again you have made us right you've made us into your below the suns you're below the daughters\nSustain a senior promise which neither heighten or depth or anything else in all creation can take from us\nTo the same Jesus Christ our lord who lives and rains with you and the Holy Spirit one God now and forever amen Harold thought he was going crazy\nOn a mediocre Wednesday morning there he was brushing his teeth when he heard the voice of his author narrating him in the omniscient third person\nWhen others mine's which fantasize about their upcoming day said the voice\nEven tried to grip on to the final moments of their dreams Harold just counted brush strokes\nHarold answered All right\nSaid federal just counted brush strokes and how do you know I'm counting brush strokes that's a scene from the two thousand six movies stranger than fiction\nWill Farrell plays Harold Crick and I are as Asian coming to grips with the fact that he has an author how would you feel to be in Harold position\nWhat would it be like to have an omniscient arm and the president on many potent narrator writing you into existence not because you'd justified yourself by what you could do but only because your author wish for you to be a part of the story\nWhat is the only reason for your life was the free and gracious choice of your author in other words what would it mean to be justified by grace alone\nThis week marks the five hundred and first anniversary of the day Martin Luther among can professor from the University of whittenberg and Germany posted is Ninety five feces\nNow before we go any further I Want to make sure everyone listening knows the Lutheran password you don't identify yourself as a Lutheran you might not have realized that we have a password so here it is justification by grace through faith\nSo what does it mean\nSometimes we lose friends we treat it like a password of code or magical formula and we've repeated to prove that we're real Lutherans\nBut what does it mean here's what it means I'm not God and you're not God God is God God is God with us or it without us but God became God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nBack to the first part I'm not God you're not God God is God\nJust a couple of months before he posted his famous Ninety five feces on October thirty first Fifteen Seventeen Martin Luther wrote the following\nMan is by nature and able to want God to be God indeed he himself wants to be got and does not want God to be God I think\nThe possibility of being in something like Harold trick situation is very disturbing for us smartphone toting self defining early twenty first century individuals' see we've been told to write our own stories and so it's strange to imagine that we might have an author\nIt's a strange thing letting God be God it's a strange thing being justified by grace alone grace alone was the phrase the first Lutheran Protestant Reformers used to describe the one way relationship between God\nAnd God's creatures\nGod gives creatures receive\nPassively like characters in a story\nThe Bible describes God is the author of the story of the world so we can think of the world\nThe universe and everything that happens in it as one great long story with all of us his characters in it then we must think of God as the author of this story this means that God is the creator but not merely like a designer\nAnd also does more than design for example my smartphone had a designer but that person hasn't touched this machine a long long time if ever the majority of of this creations lifespan is spent far removed from its design or not so with an author as long as the stories being told the author never leaves\nThe authors continuously present in with and under all the characters settings and turns of plot\nAnd author is a creator but not in the same way that a mother and father are creators of father begets and a mother gives birth to their child right away the parents begin to interact with the child is a fellow person who's like them in every way only smaller mom and dad smile baby smiles back\nThey ask questions soon she answers there's give and take a two way relationship in contrast the author character relationship only goes one way the author exist on an entirely different level\nFor example Harry Potter Ronald we usually her money Granger they don't have access to JK Rowling they're not even real in the same way that J.K rally in Israel\nThere author makes them what they are characters can't give anything to the author that their author hasn't already given them first it's a one way relationship here sell the Bible says it who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor\nOr was given a gift to God that God should repay him for from him and threw him into him are all things to him be the glory into the age of the ages Romans eleven thirty four thirty six here's how job set it in God's hands is the life\nOf every living thing in the breath of all mankind if God tears down non can rebuild if God's shut the man in non can open if\nGosh you gather to himself his spirit and his breath\nAll flash would perish together in men would return to dust job twelve and thirty four job's belief that God is the author of all things is the foreign at the throbbing source of his anguish\nIf we continue reading the perplexing book that bears his name we hear him go on to say God has torn me in his raff God gives me up to the ungodly cast me into the hands of the wicked\nWhy do the which it live and prosper why are not tons of
