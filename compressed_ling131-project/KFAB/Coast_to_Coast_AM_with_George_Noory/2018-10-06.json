even do that it's like people just they do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of that I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're doing\n[noise] I'll tell you one of the biggest pains in my side is we ...\nYeah I agree with that I had no idea\nWhat you're inviting in and it's sad because it's usually teenage girls high school who am I going to go to the problem with who am I going to get married\nTo how many kids are going to have seriously think somebody's going to know that answer well gee we only as good spirit to come\nNo trends you\nRight exactly and some of these parents they came to these girls when they were in high school their forties he's sixteen years old now and they still have this go with them never married are married five times\nIt's this this is wrong this person's life for forty years and all because they messed with ...\nLet's

all of you like anyway um other than the one little like disagree with you I'm Sorry go ahead of though about anybody you know put on them [noise] a back ... back in the\nVery large you said or the back in the day when I was like maybe Seventy eighty before cable earlier than I was watching the losers shows like watching them a lot\nAnd teach Christian pastors who was sitting on the ... and the thing about it is these Christian current stirs used to like go to sleep at night before they became group of girls who goes ... come out of their bodies\nWill lose for than go months will will with whatever so they used to do this this is workers\nAnd now let's turn to crime ... group the miners are about ... those are the some of the people that they were to attack\nHer a lot of fire surrounding the ... like in the spirit the spirit ... were were ... they couldn't do nothing you could still be gr gun or to protect your actual fire around ... ... what do you think about the\nWell you know what there's a lot of stuff I don't know about and that sounds like it could be credible I've never experienced it but that doesn't mean that can't or hasn't happened\nBut the everyday people that I run into now don't have that ability or that resource to go to so it's I can only do the best they can\nYour generally do every time I talk to you upbeat Murray yeah I've never seen you down or your energy level you've got to be able to battle these things off you like crazy I bet\nWell I I think I can but I think that he has just been what I I made a good shells around myself the older I've gotten it's gotten thicker and I'm more you know confident and in what I Do and how I Do it and\nThey're not going to have my face\nThat can happen and I and the bottom line is I have to get him out of I they need to stop ruining\nEverybody else's space to or their houses so and you know you go in the house that mess with children or hurt the animals yeah yeah yeah that goes right to the top of my list I go find a house that doesn't have dogs are kids and that if you don't like them you know don't don't torture the dogs are the kids\nTo the Cincinnati, Ohio with Laura and Laura good morning\nOh I was calling actually into from that I talk to her ... year or so ago and he said that they were than negative energy in my house and I wanted to know [laughter] and when they didn't ask her after the other\nAnd I'm here only anything that I suggested you did not do we know we did the same\nThey sound like they're in the back room whenever they might be\nWhy or how many how often much\n[laughter] the one time\nWell smoking works and it really does help get rid of negative energy\nPlanes ... excuse me\nExplain what smart ... merging\nIs actually what Native American Indians used it said you're sweet grass and\nIt's a bundle that light in your blowout and you go around the perimeter of every room in the house with the smoke\nAnd if there is a ghost in the house that will make them very lethargic laid back it makes a huge difference you will see a difference and they do not retaliate\nOr its negative energy is in the house it will help dissipated but the problem is one says and then you've got to do it especially if it goes in the house you've got to do it at least\nEvery two weeks and you have to get the smoke everywhere because the one place you don't get the smoke is where they're going to be hiding\nBut if you had the the lady from Cincinnati hopefully you'll get a minister or\nA priest come in and bless the house that makes a huge difference and much more than one because\nThe negative energy was pretty strong and one time is not going to do it\nNo I don't know if you could hear but when she was on the phone with us Murray and you could hear something like a ... so in the back room did you hear that\nI did and she did not have that or I Would have told her about it when I talk to her a year ago so obviously something more is going on in our house now\nAbsolutely yeah and this thing was interrupting her call\nWhite right\nNext up we go to mark in San Antonio Texas Welcome to the program I ... go ahead\nYes Mary my uh I kind of a last

within an hour has friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on a ... as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh\nLike I said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction\nAnd hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe another thirty miles from where we were there\nAnd uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a\nWintertime and we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like everybody in there that was in that bar well focused on me I didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what\nThe heck about like a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a oh I Am a ... the swatter right and tied up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country\nAnd it was an old I mean that was an old dad gummed CD bar\nYeah and I went in there with them and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that often enough and the air and I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nWell I've known them because I've worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it then you know I didn't\nPhil any threat from them\nIt was just in the places that I attended they not where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like\nSix or seven I was in the car and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in a car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what or there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I've started getting nervous around these people and\nAnd so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders are\nDoing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and\nIt was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where she looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you pray him and I said yep [noise] and she goes even better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and
