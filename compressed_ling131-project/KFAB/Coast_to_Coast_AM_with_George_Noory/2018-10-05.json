we've covered so many different things\nAre real special thanks to Gordon Chang joined us midway and the show and explain what the heck is going on with China and North Korea and why we should be paying more attention\nUh and uh to my buddy a Randy Sutton with the law enforcement and so much to do and do you the listeners who have been there throughout the whole show really helped out a one more caller hanging out on the buck phone lines\nIn Boston Welcome to the show Kenny how are you\nI'm Mike ... kind of like a a obscure Chester you're all it just might give somebody\nIt it does but it's not it's actually it's a a maneuver that the the Romans used to use they would say for tests so no but they would say in Latin and uh they would take\nTheir shields that's why buck says shields high because when you inhale tests do do it meant to put your shields over your head and everybody would then form a like a like a tortoise that's what to do do meant in Latin\nAnd the shields would form this impenetrable barrier so the arrows since beers would bounce off and they could approach whatever they were going to fight so that's why we yell tests do do and shield tire on this show\nBeautiful listen I wanted to talk about the um the test the FEMA test residential alert\nYeah I didn't get one myself right before when I understand this has been in a in the works standing there and I'm a Bush and that and it was expanded under fire macho include cell phones but it only right now got a implemented\nAnd so this doesn't really have much to do but the timing of it seems to me you know like why now why did it's almost seems like they did not but the thing in Hawaii when they had that alert there and the missiles or in coming off the deep state thing but a little bit of a stretch there are suppose\nWell you're you're right when you do the history on it and say started under Bush and then it was approved under Obama and it's just sometimes a coincidental when this government program finally takes action\nNow is it you know I have friends who say they must know something's going to happen and they want to tell us what what really bothers me Kenny is that now the government's got my cell phone number I already get four million uh unsolicited phone calls a day\nFor people to say did you know you're eligible for free back brace her neck brace push one\nTo get your information push nine to be on the do not call list and I used to push nine\nBut now I realize when I push nine all it says is they can sell your number to somebody else they can sell that number to someone else is going to then call me ten times a day so I now push one and I talk to them\nAnd and I try and engage them because the longer there on the phone without making the sale\nThe I'm frustrating that\nSo I'm doing it so you won't we won't get that call but I don't know that that ... um you know Michael Moore thinks it is but I don't it just bothers me that now the government has my cell phone but they don't have yours you didn't get a call\nYeah there's I I didn't get finished reading it but there's an article on line and it says some people did not get a call now I did not get it\nWhen you consider yourself lucky unless there's an attack then you're going to be walking around and go where the hell is everybody going\nFederal\nYeah may maybe just keep your eye on everybody else you you can't miss it\nLike I said I was on the golf course in my phone's they're going and ... or whatever it was you're not supposed to make the noise 'cause then I'll make a mess but

think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis I'm Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot in the style Jeff for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motive motorcycle accident\nUh-huh you're born I really yeah well you told me weird cause you must

direction where you are no I mean you get a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of the psychological shows usually ended up what is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think I really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and there were times worse the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book called the structure of scientific\nRevolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen\nAstronaut regard and\nI didn't apply for the job at no attic sciences but it was about oh Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe ... university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are\nAspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nWith Dr ...\nIt was like the beer right it is and they were leaving only\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery which you'll remember remember the entourage lists and so\nThe beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThe ... beer you know I don't know I haven't really ... up minimum yeah I'm sure\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat what have you know what have you learned about near death experiences of all the other side what do you what can you conclude at this point well\nI Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste\nA son that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your culture that accepts\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nYou people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is a very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing much do ... [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and\nYou think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nThey are having direct contact with the spirit world so they go out and they get information and then they come back and in the morning when they wake up\nIt's like if we were to read the newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of the day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience and the whole culture built around that\nAnd I think that's pretty extraordinary um they also make use of plant medicines or the Iowa ask for example\nOr something that they use for big visions\nSo if they want to anticipate what the whole groups should do Twenty years from now they'll use the ... in a collective ritual and that includes little kids you know seniors everybody in the whole sort of community participate\nThese experiences make you more aware of the possibility of God or does it take you the other way\n[noise] I guess it's a matter of definition how do we define God I think that the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this encapsulated mind body\nThat connects us to other mind bodies or suggest something vast\nI also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states of consciousness experience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWe are are going to do a lot of

[laughter]\n[noise]\nWe will take your calls next dollar with Dr Merrill Lynch ... makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories let's um\nJust want him to step Bruce march or something like\nThat right well in Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong in chest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical report\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark\nAh so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark and it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a\nFor instance one child remembered being a man from a different village or in Asia and he um\nIn Stevenson then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being and it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit a where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but\nAre evident shell but it's still compelling\nUsed to have evidence to prove that there's life after death\nIf you were like ... ... and ... knew this was challenged ... was challenged could you prove that there's life after\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show your love Ina courtroom let's do it\n[laughter] so you have a judge in a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what one shift people's mind about\nThat question and is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbove ... let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it plays the role it plays with ... what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also our lack of awareness of what we are not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm\nShifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them and yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so\nIt's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware and that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers us a point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe the consciousness Lou outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is\nSomething that has intelligence it is self correcting\nIt is reflective and so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness\nSomething much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... found that out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal in so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've tried conscious\nOr the signal or the signal it keeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet the spiritual side of all of this\nThough I mean I think

south and\nAnd you have written in the book how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I wrote a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and how can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences\nCan lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious then we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mistakes and we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and that in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHow little younger people react to these things now what do you think well\nI think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of ah there's certainly a lot of fascination with\nI you know horror movies I think you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think our imaginations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what's that about you know is that about\nJust something that is idle curiosity or is it something that\nHelps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWell let's take some calls will pick it up going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card line either\nGiovanni hey how's it going your great me it's

Gilligan with his hat you know\nAnd we were watching a move my dad and I I think with a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I just was watching these movies to kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature features and I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometimes\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand to crawl this embodied hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad said you know if the rubber hand that they filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating with liars and I'm sure his explanation was\nDead wrong but but it put into this perspective a wait there this is fun time they're playing this is a show\nThis is this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a ... this isn't something to just the torture me this is this is something for\nFun and I think that that was kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nAh I couldn't get enough you know I was a highway or if it ... and not just for all your horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the bigger umbrella of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror is an offshoot of fantasy and so it's fine I I like all of that I like uh oh I was younger movies I like a you know monsters and\nThen the robots and injured and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old is too long ago yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill the original one with Vincent Price\nRight I mean castles how hot all the while blind woman and seller man I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go for a\nWhile when you just wanted me around but I mean all these all these movies he would bring me to you know and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother's one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "05"}
