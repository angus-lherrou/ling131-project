O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars in these so called a a floor carpet in cash is we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just released them to the atmosphere and we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed bars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and it with thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of\nMel oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers\nProbably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um\nBut yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick CEO to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country but\nThe Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back a while most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people um I think India is going to rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia\nThe issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing

you illiterate armies could no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and\nUm so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do though well yeah well the\nStates that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists\nWell ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force and um\nThe you know um but no I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise] um\n[noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and\nAlso I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go and um\nYou know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure will um now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets but um if we could create air breathing proposed and that can operate at those speeds a bake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the\nPropellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not to feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block who may ah ah you know knocking on Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion door but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen to your show like anyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars\nI'm Wondering when we get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like the American like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK well there are yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right well here's the thing\nUm [noise]\nThere isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a going off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and you can even make an argument that what we\nGood to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nTies in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nAh nobody'd be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese blends the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um\nI I think that's a little a futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nOr that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions are being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because of mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the exchange for those claims to people could get a exploration missions finance\nMine asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nAnd um once our space a capabilities advance a bit more on that will become a possible thing to do\nWas go to John in Seattle, Washington and welcome to the program John go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your guess is Robert\nRobert Robert a great question the low um oh probably take them off here [noise] they're sort of speculative the first is um\nYou know anything about ... years ago but we're just talking about\nAnti gravity back in the sixties and ... ... you know anything about a couple reversal of being able to generate order for Israel gravity and secondly\nYou know anything about electrical ... or ... or ... I mean that those three questions\nIs that one one more Robert one more okay one more\nIn the third one is um we're going to be viable to design a space station like a ... thing to test I'm a human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just to run them down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one in Lear jets and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to clean artificial gravity you spend the space craft\nCrates and typical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to\nAh prevent the deterioration of

you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what did they like\nWell I'm well there's all sorts of people\nThat say they want to go to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that uh you might well one on a crew or it's going to Mars and others not a chance or the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars um\nAnd I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would select to go on a say\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind\nUm they're the people who you know have a high spirits are fun to be with that sense of humor a you know or not you know a ... um and and and ... and and and you\nKnow and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know our one for all in all for one\nThat's all you want to take to Mars what's going on with the your August conference you're working on\nA well we're having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles\nUm it could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise] um and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth\nFirst than hers while it may be the last of them no one here [laughter] yeah well I think it's a pretty good movie by the way I just saw it um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in the movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nOh okay okay\n... this movie some people found it a bit slow 'cause it was a lot in there about you know good Neil Armstrong's relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini and she knows flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and this particular nature of of of this\nThing and this this this and the daring of America at that time and um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know say well we don't know how to go to the moon\nI'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem ... say David go ahead sir\nI didn't ask you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing um okay so um it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and the things on Mars and already might stay alive but do we have any plans are there any theories on\nPossibly can relating an atmosphere where stimulating are life sustaining environment um I mean really holes that were trapped gases or you can be the atmosphere with everything we have or or any serious her plans\nFor that well\nWe discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of the soil\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you're a suggesting because marshals once in a warming planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well [noise] I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh\nI Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nThe point Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... and ah I just have a question on your thought it'd be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you in Anchorage privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you going to just be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can\nAh are you are you with the government should be some more involved in the dating how\nA possession of real poverty as it was would be more if we ever got to the point where travel was easy\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left so\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of ... so we could see which kind of government works the best\nBecause that's how we make progress on earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government or the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good ideas and some would be bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas\nImmigrants will walk there those places will grow and become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my front always great talking

that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with the go studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um it's no mystery that scientists sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explain and goes by encounters a oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as elusive\nNation interpretations are overactive imaginations which\nYou know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just go stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these\nThrowing encounters um it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know ... you know these goats I've been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over\nYou know there are several first hand account of ghosts encounters um you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes over conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's what I came up with some of these maybe theories\nAre and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my I took elements from psychological research clinical interviews Eyewitness Account of\nAnd I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of thoughts I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters with\nA book well then you bring to do some real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics\nThey're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article that kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould it be concluded today Brandon about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of that goes to encounter that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening I'm you know I think that when it comes to counter it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I say genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them why did they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take the more by ... view on goes so that's um inside is basically um a lot of the\nExtra sensory perceptions those types of things I I really think that a lot of ghostly encounters\nHappen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book go over um what I call a a tele path distress signals and sort of how they\nPlay a role and goes way encounters a so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or it was a real important part of it goes and count\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a\nWeird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters\nBut I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that you know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death or\nLife threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters\nOr so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this drama I think it it it sort of there's a lot of things that happened after that\nAnd one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it\nAnd then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting\nIn my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you\nKnow my aunt passed away right on time that I had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll saying ah to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions um\nThere is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have you know long standing allergies chronic pain for tea migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light\nFound my city and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place the Oregon\nBashes [laughter] so these environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's acts Darnell magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a better antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAnd they're picking up on things in it and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also signed saying these people are having way more ghostly\nEncounters why is that and then that's kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people didn't realize how sensitive they are picking up these things do they know they get it\nI think they do it in in in when I go out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and once you find is\nThis week in Nineteen oh one sixty three year old schoolteacher named Annie Edison Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge over Niagara Falls in a barrel with the help of

actually because Halloween approaching a go with this one\nPerfect um trick or treat [laughter]\nMy wife passed away unexpectedly over the summer\nWhile it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself\nAs Halloween approached out putting up decorations advocate a neighbor usually love trick or treating\nMy wife and I bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we have places Plaskin plastic pumpkin and our window every Halloween\nI searched out for days looking for that and so I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down a staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom she smiled and whispered jak buying the workbench and then vanish I began to weep\nUncontrollably rushed out to the garage huge smile came across my face of the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf so\nThis is a great example of a you mentioned it before an intelligent ... goes interacting with us so in this case you know that goes during his go counter to go out a conscious and she was actually giving information that the husband wanted so they're aware of their surroundings they\nThey're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness um they're not like routine specific\nYou know it's dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling of that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and it's kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences gr Brandon because the person who died comes back never had someone loses had they had the ... wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening\nUm so you know the body sort of the the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ... this\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if you have collective on consciousness or collective consciousness exist and memories of personalities and experiences of all of our humans are ... stored in the atmosphere\nUm you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm In a better place\nYou know and and I think these things I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent of the huge\nYeah yeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of a survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased could help us move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of moved towards resolution and ... and when I talk to those these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one step after these operations\nAnd I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive\nUm it can come out of a ghostly encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is um something\nTo look forward to negative things like\nA brand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters than others what's so special about though\n[noise] that that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biological is different about when they put them\nThere's there are some tests out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like I like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly or just kind of sometimes fifty fifty if\nYou want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist doesn't exist but there's

and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning soft glowing light up here next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me\nWhat was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child stating my accent died the night before unexpectedly is death occurred around the same time I saw that image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time so\nThis is a

of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon\nBy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar\nIce in various ways and all different kinds of\nFigures will appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a Kurd with an me a different figures in all different kinds of apps and some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that that those are not close by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that like with the window we're uh seen his wife saying look uh uh in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens\nCan people be so emotionally attached mentally like a husband who was white that he would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life with things that the rest of you would not\nMhm [noise] yeah yeah it's\nI don't that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it for a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not saying Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our

... just a moment\nShelly in North Dakota has the situation daughter died sadly car crash but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations or\nShe's she's not there anymore okay well I'll get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this in the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment to ... to communicate so that's like phones tax emails these types of things um you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from um a family members number who's\nBeen deceased for whether it's five days or five years um then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead\nWhich encompasses a great he he\nLists a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's phantom menace messages what just recently came out as well which goes over this as well it's hard to really know that to me I mean listen this is\nThe idea that um ghosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it is utilizing electric off of electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure uh but anytime we talked about this numerous times today anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nYou know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes parents ... experiences arts uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes go scary scary scary\nScary not like that in real life go to Joe in the Bronx I'm just going\nTo tell Joe good I'm Brendan yeah I wanted\nTo ask you a question then maybe you relate a story about a full up origin or seen um [noise] the um the question is do you think that there is a subliminal undo channel\nFull of communication going on between ... and the recipient of that goes to experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously there's the supplemental um communication to wake communication going gone that precipitate the a ghostly operation appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience a half but my brother passed away\nUm I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise] um he\nLooks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and uh it it sits during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by\nAnd he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall um can you maybe elaborate on what could have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away\nA lot to see a ... before you have the extra and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know without a husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check buying the workbench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment um possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is happening in other words he's saying get on with the\nComplete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother and ... and when you resonate with something it's not just\nInformation it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there is one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd he has this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow I feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions\nAnd then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse of the uh reading of mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprint\nAnd uh the study is available at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio or I'm In the car you can get it at audible as well so basically anywhere you can find books she can pick up\nSuper Brandon thank you love talking to you for didn't belong to Tom Dan Hi Lisa
