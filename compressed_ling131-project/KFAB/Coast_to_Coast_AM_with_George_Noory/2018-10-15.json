understand is going to happen a more frequently uh over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage it imagine this country imagine\nSome of the fallout and what about three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate one consequence of that will be there will not be any federal judge has confirmed by the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump\nThree elected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty they will not come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe if the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the state Senate under Chuck Schumer thing about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run\nAnd I condemned and twenty sixteen\nThe only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I\nWe wouldn't have any of that stuff going on and so that's why three weeks in a day for now is so important especially if you live in\nUh Ohio if you live in a\nIf you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races that will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate or whether the Republican Party will legislate\nJust think about two to six years having no federal judge has confirmed anywhere\nIf the Democratic party takes the U.S Senate they will shut down completely they will not work with this president to get anything done including criminal justice reformer reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe that Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful\nCompared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that what we're going through the past two years to fight cholesterol and scream\nTo move this country forward will stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation\nIt'll be think Trump at all costs saying the ss trunk and you know and I know so if you're in one of those contested congressional districts whether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep the house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be\nAnd especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive\nLike in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode because the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ...\nThanks for listening and I think not I think having the president on is always a great joy also Bill O'Reilly the book is killing the ss and of course diamond and so can I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show

record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three it was him you know\nAnd so I looked at the statue I started looking at the statue of Hebrew and there were looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceived it that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal of that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and

pyramid\nOur guest is Manu said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dream still or right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dream Stella\nUh most of the forum says mentions and in illustrates two things is there\nAnd desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second ... thinks\nWell there's two things his there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second thing being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take is there a second springs\nIf a great question um uh so that was for that was Robert Duvall um\nWho is interpreting the second sings a as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up and the last interview and it's a it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know there are unmistakable so so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques so there there apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of the Nile but it's there it's things buried under the fans are that say west of a free spirit it's possible\nThe\nTeam in ... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this beings but builds the great pyramid there are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just a repair guy\nBut and then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nPetri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty two or three ... so he found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story Great Pyramid how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and\nAh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed that was that they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... bother jump off of all and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred ten courses\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the thicker layers\nUm\nIs it every ten steps is it every ... there's some kind of ... you\nKnow that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I\nI'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you would you just you know simple mind that I thought each step they weren't just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians design the appearance with something called they called it set that\nWhich is the pyramid and go and it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward and that's how they conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's low regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen than earth decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension yeah\nWhich which Jimmy I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I I think I said that uh the ...\nTo ... um shot a shop\nTo ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing or during the twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade into big tipper it was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation big tipper was so important to Egypt shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper\nAnd we we why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation do\nI get a jump in right there the coast to coast and we've got to take a break my new this ... church

this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing mole and you're right I'm I'm I'm this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks is twenty three some of these peaks a war specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also listed and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen\nA chamber and based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know his courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and we're back where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not ten\nNow we're going to get to that exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example course number Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that alliance with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nAnd that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower I'm now there are\nThere are two courses nine twenty fifth and and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact the tower um and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here\nUm that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\nNo roe eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this and that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got it yes of course we don't know exactly which is it's kind of uh\nThe image so I just kind of like you know paint that that into this illustrations just to give a rough guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion at go back ... taffy and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock\nWe are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the line and see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go back to lead tabby the erosion on this thing's all of these things are Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go back leads happy not an accident\nNo within references of course uh with lines too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak what authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry it's yours\nGo back

Kathy\nYou liked that my news you liked that area [laughter] okay I\nAm a war I always love hearing is that all that it may have or do you place great for me they gave it to power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick joke about their armored child just at the end\nOf the first question they asked her is credited with Jimmy\n... or the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is all Howard graphics around go back in Egypt in that area of the world\nThe same hieroglyphics that are found and the pyramids of Mexico central and south ...\n... is the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff lipic inscriptions in Beckley taffy is that what you're asking\nOh no I'm asking is are the hieroglyphics that are written all the ... and ... and so forth and go back with the all the same hieroglyphics that are found on the air is in Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so yeah there are different\nHigher there are different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the era lipic inscriptions in Quebec it kept me in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there\nAnd um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist and I don't have any fancy degrees after my name right but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at go back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H on the belt\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks in ... are are they related I don't know right there are

there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page three twenty eight of of of this report\nA minute this is the question this is from ... Kim she says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to haven't\nHaven't yes um I haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the of the great pyramid\nHas revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking at the Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nDescend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think is looked at you be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform\nTo this uh you know the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth and so\nAnd I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he'll wash my shirt and many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring or Arab Spring uprising or he resigned\nWhat is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer on the air\nGreen question Daniel my new what's it like there are now with you regarding\nTalked to have a lot so first of all I have a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so I'm the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that they are they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they've won research to happen\nAnd other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted um you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is ... how ... was a job of director there\nHe I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the boards of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think they're sort of a mixed\nBag you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then probably there's the\nThe scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it at all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to search them and\nI to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said some political right now and I I understand that my new and I respect that yeah I mean there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stand and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to open ... are they\nHave to back pedal yeah so the listener's question I think I forgot was Daniel I think right yes yes so I think one of the love and so I think that something has changed uh they're sort of\nYou know people are even talk to some of some of the scholars scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can say that can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there but I knew I got a ticket quick network break this is coast to coast am more by new when we come back stay with

Kush which which is of course ... ... to ... years ago\nOr ... or ... as the you know we're talking about a quite of three ... for ... years ago ... older than any other language you can put a little little full of Harlem so ... which was\nOf people who is just big well it's a cush people still\nIt'll ridge back which are from the coach\nWhich is do you think like who does a little late it was a little people well the pilot or they should be you know heighten ... or ... or the wall\nI I'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thank you for the phone call\nA minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges\nAre saying that are in the old kingdom or that term was not use so the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the kings of the old king them I think\nThe first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared and that's\nAll I Know about it offhand I said what I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here a bomb we're ... we're going back to a man as a um and the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings\nYeah right right\nLike in armor and men is ah the first uh kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same a menace unarm are may be the same or they could be two different things they weren't called pharaohs back\nThen right and now there's another ah I have\nResearch that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um\nI it regarding what the king was called I can tell you\nBut uh by the fifth dynasty the king had five different titles um and in the very beginning um you know the kings were called\nHorace came so it was horse in the armor and horse or a ...\nSo uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a campaign you know the designation a nest when vets which is basically referring to operate in Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later I'm but I'm the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up it sounds like twelve hundred BC is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies let's go to Jay out here in Los Angeles Jay you're up next on coast [noise]\n[noise] hello hello J. lo J.\nHow you guys doing hello how high is there a first time caller long time long time listener I'm I Am actually\nUm Egypt and sent on mom's side and I'm growing up as a kid I Would always\nHear my grandmother ... tell me a lot of stories that there was always passages from here there there's always secrets to the\nUm the great pyramid has secrets to this to tunnels here and I was there you know there's always stories that Graham you know grandkids hear their grandparents say the one that always stuck with me that I really wanted to get clarification on I've seen stuff like on line but\nI Try to take it with a grain of salt\nUm I really am glad that you're on the show a ... I really wanted to ask you for your um [noise] uh expertise on this if you guys have ever heard is there an opening or any access\nBehind this thinks we're all on top of the head or anywhere along in that area or maybe the bottom of the paw and the back\nSomewhere like that that has access to an insight\nChamber of this ... of the things that I'm holds or something\nVery dear to humanity that we are ah [noise] we are not being told 'em all the details of have you have you guys heard any anything like that\nWell gee you're in luck because men who's been researching the ... paper about it so I I'm a ... now my new before we get to what's underneath the the ball on the left or from the left from palm\nUh there has been photographs of the top of the banks fried in the ground up or what appears to be I have to roll but and I have also read a lot of research about\nThe right here uh an entrance behind the right ear that Jay is referencing year so let's talk about uh the head of this thing's first and possible entrances\nYes so there is a there is a space or in inside the head of the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts a move all was telling me about this I think or you can there's you can stand in there it's maybe six foot deep I'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind pouch but\nUm but you know maybe there are some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the yoga roasted ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth\nCharted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by\nA a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd she has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves are into this things and looking for chambers\nAnd then you know the one that to me just mention of course we know from seismic analysis that they are yeah those are spaces under this things and one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or a was studying or years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a manmade sort of\nFeatures and we think that um that might be something that's of interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to hopefully drilled right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look\nEspecially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven and\n... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters a deep and uh and and then Robert uh you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a deficit problem and then of course you know that's I have often marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non invasive study and really fine map the space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then we're try a small pro or into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this this this rumors going around yeah requiring\nI Need help I'm listening I Need help\nI'm

like that it could that possibly be the original thought and the guardian the\nOh that that is the million dollar question Mary and thank you for that uh my new gardening beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I Want to recommend an author to you a merry hum a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt um and so you may find something\nThere's a you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly [noise]\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the ah the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think\n'em and believes that the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something and the have the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before it's on a ... as opposed to some of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a\nAnd it would have been a you know as sphere and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things\nThere's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not up to your media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it um\nNow you've got to anomalies and uh and and one is clearly defined ed row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that height um how big a chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by eight and hide I'm saying right or\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah I Know how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might\nThat'd be stacked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that a lot of gun shy and bring a suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the places that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and buyer investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the northeast corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up to a place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers to me it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any efforts excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know if you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten million or something like that you do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and things that's a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am host you'll be church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening here going into Monday morning more

the ... well aside from the just sending passage\nWay to the lower chamber is any of the pyramid underground\nAs I'm I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so um you know one way to marry\nA theory of lost civilizations starting something gave a and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro was your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look\nOn on the pyramid itself on the on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that walk\nThat's not humor in stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stone to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on in the three locations and they were lying to you know the bell stars of uh Ryan a dating to step peppy\nAnd then you know the old kingdom Egyptians came they basically built up your image on top of these shrines\nAnd so uh and the ... so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you walk into the pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight here on coast yeah I loved\nIt so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left what's
