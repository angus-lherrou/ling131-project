centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far apart there's the far right is the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off\nThe far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are poll right this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans bullied him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats\nHated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that that social unrest and this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis a Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nIn the end the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge and I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument and its arguments in hatred bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this it every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to

and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about the ... the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose\nIt's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of

mean we were in the same position and we were coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally ... and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... apple loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look\nThis is a reversal this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going\nMuch harder for Trump to push is gravy train for businesses it ... is the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand

Michael\nOn his way out subject Callahan Fox News still a tropical storm but just barely the remnants of what was hurricane Michael now moving across the coastal Virginia and soon headed out to see well back in Florida the cleanup is\nOn a man he is a dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nVery welcome back to close to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within the can you predict up five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what\nWe see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George is that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states is kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics or we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent\nIt worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and Bob which will be driven by emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money there so you can buy these battles and things like that everything from gold\nIron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first show yet but next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than ... after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference\nOn George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent shoulders if you want to call it a real estate and more and more countries including the U.S today massively in Japan and places like Germany\nThere's more old people dying and selling homes than young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and then of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be ... it'd be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption or around the world and it makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time\nAnd then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this ... they need us or our trade is three times tilted\nTowards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise]\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because\nPeople don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging\nThey also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent so so there are there risks to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a fight city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nAhead of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the\nMore affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits and we're going to vote them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits and savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go the keys in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricane struck him because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having had a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in ... here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower yield workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd a ... year the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people that's not happening up here ah in New York former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nOr anti Bob the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are letting\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with the Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance\nAnd and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week in Eighteen forty five

questions and I want to get a few legs and because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly started swiping money out of more flew an account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but but\nThis is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nThis come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst\nAnd and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTwo thousand a year in one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat well he has a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think\nThey should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on and uh you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust sin if you know send period ... to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy\nAnd then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend the red line you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or do they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and the have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron in very good\nWell hello there George an area that question you mentioned earlier about the banks and you can't just now but uh the chicken the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage has been it was kind of opposite end the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was forms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to exploit for money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with ... Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nOkay thank you\nAnd I think here I just think that part of one of my questions but the more I asked\nA direct them I Can't even I have one of my parents ... flying a lighting up I'm like hey if it's you know they can handle it and it comes to mind\nRight yup they play all about timing\nAll of that tiny one of my guiding the looming psychology and how can I tell you that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income in that much um I don't have to worry about that so much\nAnd as a larger town hall or is that what I understand\nI mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected in whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major class but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few cows and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get out\nYes you're going to be less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people going to hit for the positives more Iceland\nWent down and basically all the foreign depositors of foreign loans and protected their own people so yes smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a\nProtected account and your name is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank

interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders Norma first came out many people asked me if that was based on stories with my patients had told me but\nMy aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential adopted bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that the doctors should not be paid anything he told the Asians and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nStories from my readers and to my audience and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls for that so many ... that [noise] um you know\nIt's been a lot of literature written about near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back Dr salmon moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated that something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut it's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were announced clinically dead and never had it on their desk or in [noise]\nBut when I look at how my host Russia's ... me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these close calls it that I and to have a deep for peace Haitian of life and I I also have over it and my fear of dying and I found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the first couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... yeah\nThey just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because\nI didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite\nDramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous themselves don't pollen allergen it transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone\nOn the worldwide ... computer as this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in and out of the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well\nYou have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that's why I eventually they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now that the person who gave me the transplant he was an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow so\nHe was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC and the\nTeam from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThen have you still in touch with them that that that are happening\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and they\nHear altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is a cheek swab\nI said that's it yeah it just it takes time to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bang and then um\nYears later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells and they gave him these injections for five days\nAnd then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what what was brought back to where I live\nCloser but yes we've become friends than I just saw not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic role has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\nWell I've tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients\nGenerally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise] however since I have that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there well\nAbsolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one

psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon Mandy let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who's dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this fellow until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death the visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which on the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say is coming from something they've added or we could say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear\nYou know um\nAnd maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to get into the dream state of other governmental leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know while they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of\nGetting having making someone have a heart attack I didn't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how did we know\nIt's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I thought I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\nAnd the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition above the\nIdes of march [noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with ... told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their promotions maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree\nBecause I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water issue though after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregard things which could be dismissed as superstition\nThere's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was the horse racing though yeah one of his friends apparently\nUnderstood who's gonna win the race but didn't back on that horse that on something else some loss and Dr seuss in movies screaming and you knew you knew you knew that's a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think\nPeople are they don't believe they don't believe that and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\n\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they\nRecover from the anesthesia and they wake up to be able to tell the doctors and nurses are what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his\nDoctors tie and of course the doctor was astounded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on\nAnd then when he when he recovered they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right you have you back\nBut then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that we're over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were well yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual components life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them psychics and people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr mystical are mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same events so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every parent normally then of course it depends on the having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think all of their life for people to feel like there is something more that we don't have to live in nine to five eight and ... they live that if something more that we don't really know about and I think it should but\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls

cleaned up of begins blood jak Callahan Fox News this monster storm\nOkay\nWell come back to our final hour with Dr many ... we're talking about his work the borders of normal as a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the fake it from a psychotic experience for example if someone here the voice\nI'm a psychotic ... nation tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday\nAuditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices it could be it sounded machinery\nAnd in fact\nIt may be more than one voice too with the voices talking to each other about the person\nThey might be a accusatory or threatening where I'm psychic aloof nations and to be ... feet when\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming the other thing is with fake ...\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person because fake hosts it has a major mental disorder which affects the ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other him aside from the of the nation for example ... or paranoid I ...\nOr you know feelings have ...\n... people are talking about and that type of thing so that it's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis is that conceivable\n[noise] yes in fact it had happened and if a psychology that did an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients while they were patients they were actors pretending to be ...\nThat they were misdiagnosed as it's panic they admitted to the war they were giving medication they didn't take medication and once they got the word the patients that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they had they were hearing voices and come to their parents their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them completely normal so that's why I say you can make a diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors couldn't figure that out\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes I can make mistakes\nWell that's true but but but the patients didn't\nEffect because well the Asians live with it they they know the illness so\nThey know the symptoms and everything that said All right let's take some calls here for your Judy in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead thank you so

Michael\nNo wasn't that one it was something else but I was a great movie but so you think that there's some kind of injury to the brain could augment your psychic abilities\nYes it it could I could open you left or different dimensions because I've I've heard of cases I Know of of people who\nHave had near death experiences and then when they recovered they become psychic and they're able to see or as a blow to know predict the future and they have all kinds of psychic abilities which they never had before\nNext up let's go to Gary in Monterey, California Hi Jerry go ahead\nHi uh I like their practices 'cause uh I'm a skeptical person and uh I've got degrees or ... degrees and says and I talked to physics engineering for years so I'm kind of a you know that kinda gosh you're\nHowever uh I had a dream that aim to come through a many years ago when I was in my thirties and a ... as offended and says a ... that's disturbing you know our view of space and time uh right now it doesn't seem to a law information flow backward in time\nSo I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year to a record my dreams and his first I tried a member of the seventies the portable tape recorders are kind of clunky\nMhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like recording play at the same time you write\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button so I went back and just writing things down on paper\nAnd of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a dream I figured out a method for that that took me some of the world's reliable\nAnd one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual ally ... and then I decided but what happened later will be interesting and that was as a as a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him and comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her and uh at one point\nThe the nail says uh and we're outside I'm kind of a format outside I you know couldn't figure out that Matt\nBut anyway he says a [noise] a very I have to go to the bathroom you know where it is\nAnd I said no you know I Do too we were had been drinking a cup of Vermont I said I Do too and so uh yeah let's go look for it and and the dream rafter ... rock side but some kind of structure outside of a couple of steps\nAnd then there's another walkway going both ways more cable and then I Would of apple and just like many levels and finally I said oh look a there's the bathroom down there and so I'm looking ahead of them and the and the dream\nAnd I get to the door and I pushed the bathroom door open and there and I'm trying to not be grossed about this but there I see something unusual and the wind was is in rent rooms have toilets of course we're you know the doors closing in your little ... and then they have you're All right\nSomeone had an error no gun number two in other words [laughter] [noise] so I stopped in my tracks\nAnd and he ran in can meet this fellow in my dream and he said what are you doing and I said oh ah somebody just as something really awful and hair and he said he'd take them\nAnd uh at that point\nI had a lot of foreign students I taught my college we recruited all over the middle east and [noise] uh and and the Pacific region at the end of the Asia Japan [noise] a lot of foreign students in my classes\nAnd so I said well you know maybe it's a person from another culture who didn't understand that and you know he thought that was the place to go to the bathroom and you know [noise] okay so I wake up and I thought that's a weird ...
