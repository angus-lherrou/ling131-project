New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to\n... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nAnd so not yet but in oh five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shocks and surprises your audience will cross over the sun\nThe solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nUh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nOf my field people look at these kind of thing with like a nation's chart a nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up\nIn a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now what\nAbout Chris zones now cryptic does\nThis this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology\nIt's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred Ninety four years the ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually looked at by people going back\nA couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have a all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were stronger is they just didn't have the scientific\nKind of things that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water so to make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nWell it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one ... you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at say midnight in in the nation's capital\nHere or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because all\nBe on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world\nLever is always a rising and the sun is a Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to feed and all the other planets like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home side of areas which doesn't actually look\nAll that wonderful for the planet because Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own fine actually late on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars and um exercise and\nEngineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but suddenly Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this is what's the old idea exactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness of pseudo science mumbo jumbo it inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the ... still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that it's free they taking in the first breath like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America is chart because it was a first\nBreath we're we're saying guess wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that charts but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various plan if it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that say about the potential\nOf my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month stay in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate or you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month staying here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it near noon his son said is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same science but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts are moods even reincarnation and looking back who may have been or the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but the so polarizing signed which was signed rise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nAnd are telling me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done ever you know in this field\nWell unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay 'cause I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't Thirteen I was thirty what had happened\nTwenty two when I got into you know the other is on the nuclear at Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take phone calls in just a moment right here on the

[noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first day of the first day of the chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people have studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault\nThey were all went to that phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is who was the science was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt\nRome great you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay worn out one forty two in the afternoon now\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty\nQuick in and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can tell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nWelcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah\nI ... that you know the great you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark your birth date your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon\nAnd tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives in like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other lives particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn that's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn\nIs in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he strengthens his immune system and stays healthy\nThat um he doesn't become pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nYou have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not alone now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on\nUm go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics astrology\nThe power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you a ... inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAnd I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there was a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere was a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep psychic Lee people who who\nWho can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kinda thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else so that's all part of things indefinitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and our incarnations like in the chart\nWe're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan of higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... under a marine reincarnation astrological you speaking yeah we're the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of\nThing you know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do\nOkay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century Mike ... will come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman that\nBeing able to come into the world of north ... time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses\nParents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing went to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go out to Cleveland Donna's with us welcome to the program and that's my buddy Geraldo Rivera is in Cleveland or

interesting just like the previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius\nAquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also a psych equality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller have an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three you have five left devising Capricorn more than even where you have an Aquarius and Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George something really for two to good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own

you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but\nMedia you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one in August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm ... there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic Lee the people who like are prone to respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final cool series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert

thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of a link to hire spirits what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that is deep and significant so that\nYou don't get down on yourself are worried we're stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo in on the line called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you you've done in the past efficiency organization service to other people like\nPossibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or doctor were were a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning\nLanguages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years some kind of deep seated study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car loan next one may poor Nineteen sixty nine may for Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea or money and should I moved to a different state um uh when I was born in a quiet city court\nThey know where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in Kuwait and he's a well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or not I don't know okay no problem okay you said money\nThen where what state to live and what's neat deliver these in Kelly right now\nOkay well first of all there is an even on my website it's called

graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around\nFrom like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere on the planet to understand what's good and what isn't that California is and this is another big thing that people don't realize and\nAstrology every state of the union has a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon so you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your earth wind and California's earth sign\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you of mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyman to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the near future um and because of your ... and it's\nHome signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son signed ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there's a planet X. out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah in fact uh see I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on said no when President

planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little\nIt's like higher on the truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously are not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes there were very significant\n... mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New

the tour of Charles Lindbergh\nAround the United states after his um ground I his historic uh um plane flight from New York to Paris and Nineteen\nTwenty seven and ... a a Kato I got very interested in in this subject but exactly how and why I I I don't know I don't ... remember him saying anything about\nI Know it was after Kenneth Arnold citing all yeah\nWas that was June of Nineteen forty seven\nThat's right that's right now and he really got interested in this and didn't he have a lot of friends bought one worked in the Pentagon\nI ...
