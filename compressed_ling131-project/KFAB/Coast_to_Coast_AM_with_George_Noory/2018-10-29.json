for you you know when you look at the depth and breadth\nAnd the sheer number of different strange in one Bruce and scary being the kind of things that you cover in this book monsters do you use your germ\nCan't help but wonder are you know are we humans completely off our rockers to see so many things for so long so many of them that seemingly don't exist can't exist or is there some kind of a common read or the ... all these things together\nWell I guess the one thing more than anything else that ties whether it's like monsters big for it's a marked man you name it the yeah the I guess the one thing more than anything else that puts them in the ... agrees that federal one hundred percent elusive one hundred percent of the time now of course\nSkeptics with say well that's because they don't exist um but\nI have to admit you know the thing that that wanna angle that kind of ties or the so called monsters together is the fact that they are elusive and I'm In some cases I think you know if you're dealing with things like like monsters that can be quite understandably feel daily way the [noise] you\nKnow a forty mile long lay and you know seven hundred I faith a tape um most of us don't have the money to hire a mini submarine you know to go looking for these things so that that's one of the problems we have is that um\nYou know the just the logistics of trying to find some of these things can be quite difficult particularly so when they the scientific community and the zoological community\nYour turn their heads away from these kind of phenomena so um you know that can be problematic but um I always tell people I mean if you look back in history [noise]\nUm you know it's only been a couple of centuries I'm\nEven before a lot of recognized animals where was found to exist in the first place so I think it's important to remember that but um you know there are surprised he's still out as much of a the world which still remains under explored\nYeah you have a several of the creatures are monsters that are in your book they're based on things that we know existed at one point giant beepers for example or you know some of these things that look like dinosaurs that are believed long extinct in ... and wild places\nYeah I mean they sort of all fail falls into the failed to what's known as crypto zoology and crypto zoology as it is it a little bit pompous you know you you cannot sort of become a professor of crypto ...\nBecause there's no degree you can pay to pay what you\nKnow it's um but if people ask me you know all your crypto zoology they'll say well yeah but I I cite knowing how their interpretation of the word you know I'd rather\nJust be seen as like a I Know courageous sake amongst out and said with a I was think crypto zoology is a little bit pompous I'm I'm sort of pseudo science but a ... like you followed his\nYes exactly but what I Would say is that you know when you're when you're looking at all these different things you know you mentioned creatures that um we're ... we're ... things may not be I mean that relates to big forts and they bought and it will snowman for example one of the more intriguing theories\nIs that they say of the Himalayas the Aaron I'm of China and possibly big thoughts may be a survivor relics of a giant type that it exists or write about ... and ...\nYears ago called ...

commonalities with these creatures though yeah maybe ... that were reported long ago are now being reported ETs or aliens and it\nMay be the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different cultural prison where you come down on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John ... would particularly and I think one of the things for me at least\nI mean I've you know different people get difference you know responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of type of you that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or

it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA at an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called a wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\nBut yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid\nSo I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland far Iceland\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they become known as window areas where it seems every fit and his brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had seen this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use over the woods or at a high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out to point platforms in the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that

I'm much weight of a sort of very ...\nAnd don't and look entirely human they sort of almost ... ... and ... like I Know a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know whereas in the movies ... secret agents of a sacred agency\nBut Terry telling me the story of times Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd they create demanding black time towards them sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically the the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like demonic was ... was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes these old black suits and just gave off this really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said it was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of folk after that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for\nYou know others other cases it just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nOr ... you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nWe're well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm up to five books now on on this phenomena foreign them at in black and one on the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they step out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies back typically are described as looking ... you know go on and skin is why\nWhy why I'm I'm people talk about ... mind control the personal hypnotized them pay for even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and shake afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right after pay for using wage of ... which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know they should a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a [noise]\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X. files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe based but many black ... street it's far beyond you know just guys in a black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of 'em are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are\nCarrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a ... you know you got a really weird one next couple of land so much off Asia apps to explain there is a power with the men in black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for that might be but I think it's a very small catch a great versus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was what I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support base\nIs that over the years agencies may actually unemployed the legends of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words the ... paper within

real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication diet is the first to November but people can already got it [noise]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which will be declassified through the ... in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the ready to leave us it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWind up present paper with a guy to showing how falls would be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contact a movement of the Nineteen fifties which preceded\nThey abduction phenomena by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would\nSo to speak but um\nGovernment agencies do ah put together falls on paper who claimed to have had I in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George Burns hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons but they\nTold the FBI that they the Iranians had a government government's very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick\nUm Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm over ... she was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn fool around his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments\nNow what's particularly striking\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning it back to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nOn this they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday\nWhat's intriguing is that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused cold day a promise to the security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that what's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the\nThe the they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most challenging and intriguing aspect is that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing\nOn on goal of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact ... and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realized that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA sciences studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean Georgia ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that that sold in huge figures gigantic numbers of books with salt\nUm and a a ... he went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file honor dams skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this\nCombination angle and I'm\nA number of the the contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example again in the u._k. a you have the theory of society created by George king that was closely watched 'em by the British a police force because I'm\nGeorge King various aside to be very much I'm On the nuclear weapons I'm so falls were opened on them so in other words yes we have files opened on the contact pays but predominantly because they have this political slams\nA in many of their claims but the important thing is\nThe end of the day what it boils down to is that the FBI and the other agencies were opening surveillance files on people who claimed close encounters um wave nonhuman entities\nAre you in a report in the book that's coming out the first of November um\nTop secret alien abduction while Europe were something that I had read before it's about a brief famous case\nA Antonio BS Bowers or the ... this is an abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes the government surveillance to all different level still that story\n[noise] well yeah this this is a strange one I mean they the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional um aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio village ...\nClaim to be taken onboard a UFO and as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking um alien woman and I'm I'm for all kinds of ... he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it wasn't Eileen abduction case\nI'm within you

looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and and combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\n[noise] well I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and\nI'm clearly a real one and it does seem to be tied to both ... and um\nThe abduction phenomena and one of the things that's as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that phase whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that up rights outside of government\nYou know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government but it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly now the ...

was a\n... house yet I outlaw yeah\nYeah the death of a ... stories and interesting one you know it was um [noise]\nYou know a bunch of a Russian papal um you know where it together with friends and

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] you know it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people\nAnd cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of the privilege to be could be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one move in a new direction by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it would be sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents isn't and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest and spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess would be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nI'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation and traditional really with through religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very real\nSense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the option a really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and and the fence and interested in ... book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like dark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and brace with ... with offensive odd mystery and I wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look out of the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time reading normally Georgia through\nYeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you've sort of reached out look kind of look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kind of concepts on the program all the time as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um\nI Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and\nMaybe I can just say worried about that for for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm a\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimensions three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's length with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and with and then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object\nHas three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd the the ... the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations look clean or they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the audience have heard of string theory but\nSure yeah I'm using so yes there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these were basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions 'em and they do it again in order to make make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern covering the universe their\nString theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics and the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality\nUm and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit\nTogether we have we have\nWe have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm a governor governor subatomic world was the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work you know the correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and so on hum and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the ... version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nBut maybe they don't know that you're friendly to the military you hire military members and in fact you run an award recently\nYou know we we have a significant commitment to the military and recently were very broad uh we won the freedom award which is the single biggest award that a civilian employer can win from\nThe department of defense for our support of military men and women specifically I'm In the guard and reserve and their spouses so every year there's you know a few thousand companies nominated for this award may only on her Fifteen and it's a lifetime achievement award so we can't win that again but we're excited to have it in our lobby right now to what we've got to lead of trucks\nThat support various causes that we find near and dear to my heart and so we have the freedom fleet that is representative of the United states military and there's about ten freedom trucks out there on any given day fully wrapped up supporting our men and women and and the armed forces [noise]\nUm we have a first responder truck a so called our hero operation hero truck on that risk that is honoring does and in the new firefighters and police et cetera [noise] for the work they do and then recently we've actually rolled out to a Susan G combing trucks that are full wrapped\nRepresentations of those that are battling cancer and kind of the race for your [noise]\nUm and they travel the

Christopher white other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions there's a character who's a explain name Jay be racially\nI wanted to share a quote with you because it's sort of flows from what the Robbie with singing about and that song there are men have got to feel at home in the universe again and I I Believe a great deal of the despair of our time is due to the fact that men meaning people\nHave a false picture of the universe and our destiny having lost religion and gained nothing in its place too many people have come to believe that light doesn't amount to\nThere are several people who are profiled in the book who struggle with is the uh\nApparent contradiction between spirituality and science I'm ready to get into a couple of examples and how they got through

with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it alone get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less uncover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act\nNow our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nThanks my this is Michael method for health

T. three and five ... sat in\nNews radio and living in a baby [noise]\n\n\nWe're back with Christopher white Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah he his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension and has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual level levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted incomes an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation is he he embraces map Madison geometry as a kind of a he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty to him\nBut I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in and the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he starts to think you know well what if these what if these mathematical variables in my ... and you know these higher higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of\nSpaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he developed a way of what he thought of as sort of re educating the fences in order to catch glimpses into the\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating offenses that involves um no it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know that three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the position of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then hill and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and memorize all those positions\nFor essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues\nSort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing your research but instead he he was doing things like put into this uh this cue the cube set together and helping coach the printed in baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gun which was one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure print and he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time has probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations on her own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block we are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that\nThat block right are we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYou're right you're right it lays it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how we are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say are four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions in one temporal dimension\nThe dreaming self he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments and Don believed that I'm using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space last for their um that's what he believed was happening somehow the dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and you could we could talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that as\nYou know maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody everybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that every one of steak haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and then they followed he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal [noise] he\nWe've that everyone would be able to see that all of our dreams and future events and after that I'm sort of mixed up together [noise]\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science as a sharman remote viewers\nOut some of those ideas that we've discussed on this program before white fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David great sail away to listen to the break\n[noise] no you can get show updates and connect with other coast

Jennifer boom garden joins us here thank you so much for the invitation and grateful there's so much great music from all the classical composers and then those people come up and go when you do a star wars again so very mix all of a right\nWe do that and I think that's that's the great things that people don't necessarily always know about assessing orchestra is it's an incredibly versatile\nOrganism there's sometimes we have the orchestra doing for different programs in a week and we'll be seeing that occasion program where our primary audience is early elementary school kids in the same week doing a program working with our Hispanic community to celebrate Hispanic heritage month at the same time rehearsing for the opera which is the next week\nAnd doing a symphony rocks show all in the same seven days and that I think is is the gift\nThat are in the ... can bring to a community the numbers are quite staggering actually so when you think about the um Hudson's bay and\nIt's like it's over a hundred and twenty thousand people every year and of course the number of those books are in our culture but I Would say over thirty percent or not and we've got twenty five thousand of our area students to participate in education program all the way from a mission imagination program at the first introduction to our\nPre school and early elementary kids to a partnership with Carnegie Hall in New York um which allows kids to study music with recorders remember recorders yeah fluke I yeah\nI Love Lincoln because the teachers in front of the curriculum in their classroom such a big responsibility for them but then the culminating event as the kids come to the concert home with their recorders\nAnd they all play with the orchestra loved one of the great program right into the high school programs were able to partner with some of our other arts organizations like the job market is the I'm not really for the kids to do hands on workshop in many different art forms the first half of the day and then the last one was in the afternoon\nAfter another CEO use you know thing for me you know hard in our community and thank you were listening to

yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experienced like a near death experience um and I have them talking about their experience and then I also\nHave scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book I'm\nTalking about what the meaning of these events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of in fighter intuition or near death experiences are out of body experience with them and so on\nAnd and that they are you using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set up this courses that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right to have these dreams for him to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he\nDidn't actually go to the Bible that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went through he went to sort of popular science book um and I think that that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by a man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's\nAll kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been given Vonn earth right I'm ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity on\nAnd we talked about dreams earlier I think after your dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another round and\nIn other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing a chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely\nThey're all different all different different methods are so I'm Wondering if the\nIt had a dream that seemed to predict the future um you know I've never had an out of body experience right or or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about so\nYou know I Know deja vu I have had deja vu for sure yeah perhaps yeah I'm so in the book I tried to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are happy and um\nYou know and I try to put him play their voices and and how they understand what's happening [noise]\nUm but I don't I don't know about finances you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing if this book taught me one thing it would be that I think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah\nAnd amazing really than than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um\nYou know I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these or these this this is a cosmologist and read their\nRead their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there is no way that anyone could have an experience like that um\nSo I guess I Would just remain open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that would happen and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book the book it has all of these big questions um\nIn which we will give away the United states flags free of charge to schools churches clubs organizations we suppress their three million play donate in this last year\nThat's an example one of the things we do we also have committed a few years ago to the national focus on fighting hunger we've raised over

you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and the dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for

her husband the expertise but we'll ask him\nThere I mean gun in his book on dreams doesn't\nReally talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know say things like you know\nTalk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dreams them but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up whenever\nIt is right down I'm as many details you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering are grants sort of evaporate pretty quickly after the wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know how people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talked about um\nDream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this is the first for me from volcano California the caller is Brennan got good morning Brennan\nMorning what's on your mind\nAbout is a street paralysis so\nI keep having episodes where [noise]\nUm I'm just a little bit I'm suffering from a solemn yeah so\nWhen I get on these rules but I don't sleep secular gave very well it seems like after about five or six days of this but I get on this trip we're falling asleep on my body is falling asleep with my my mind's awake and I guess they cause the process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's always themes that I see and usually are trying to get me and told me out of my body and not only that\nI can hear them they talk to me so I'm curious on what your thoughts are on is this just an illusion of it you know my solution eighty and like\nYour Internet or wicked PTO will say that doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that during the state of my body is and I'm able to actually I don't want to say teleport but you know something along that lines into that and it's very scary actually yeah\nYeah yeah right yeah I think like I call you\nRented looked out let's let Christopher respond thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well he mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also seemed to I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are ... there there is a category of sleep per hour from there are there are things that happened when people are falling asleep or waking up in the sleep browser thing is it's scary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise]\nYou know and it can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so [noise]\nYou know uh get the question is is is merely a a physiological biological um [noise]\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening the spiritual world I guess my answer I don't know I think that if you if you do look online or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know that they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology but um if it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of their spiritual realities\nMaybe I don't know you know in in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um [noise]\nUh that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a from ... from sort of aspect of

that\nCan be quite understandably feel daily way the you know a forty mile long like him you know seven hundred I have a tape um most of us don't have the money to hire a mini submarine you know to go
