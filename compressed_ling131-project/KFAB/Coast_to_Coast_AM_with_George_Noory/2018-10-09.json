that we're ever willing to have I find myself after leading a few hard truths throwing in the towel exasperated and not even sure where to start again not because I don't want to fight the good fight but because it feels like we're having two different conversations\nI won't so badly to find a way to kind of make my case just to get them to explore the truth outside of the talking points\nBut I Can't even get there\nThere's so much education or information lacking on their part how do you do this five mornings a week on your show I commend you for that just venting frustration I Know you

really is where where are you know it's interesting to hear the Saudis we always had very clean language on this show but what is considered a swear I got in trouble for saying crap with somebody the Saudis ... which is a word that you can use that not considered a square anywhere that I'm aware of\nAnd there was oh I also said gosh darn and I got in trouble because somebody said well you might as well say the other G D I said well no that's if I if I start my tone I yell out oh judge at the top of my lungs that's not a curse right that's that that's the not curse\nThing uh\nBut it is what it is um [noise]\nAnyway you ran a road uh I watch the vote in the sense that I Am so proud judge Kavanaugh didn't give up so but it and give up hope you're west coast trip went well thank you Brandon and I'm Glad he did not give up\nAs well ah Nate in my opinion the Democrats jumped the shark with ... and sweat next accusations it was so over the top and destroy the argument that victims never lie\nTo independently minded observers do you think the Democrats wanted ... to come forward you suspect as I Do that one sweat and its accusations occurred they knew it was actually damaging to their credibility\nI I think that's why it was a disaster for the Democrats because she was a it was ... it was it was obviously incredibly disruptive and dust and disgusting but it was completely non

technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my pod cast about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nJust machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\nThe thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nThat does any thinking at all it's it's one was in zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off\nOr at the speed of light um it's done with with relatives and it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for forty years says just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it ... it goes like this series is there's this room\nA that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese to this librarian the librarian picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nOr they thought that perjury interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a bunch of money came that everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took a nap for ten years\nThen there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business you can make probably any department in your business and ten percent past ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now have\nThe technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more than ... and I\nAh we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a peaks or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also step for gun powder and\nYou know it can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could ask you to to an artificial intelligence that\nFights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so ah it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems is\nGoing to have it well for for three very easy reasons you could argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you going to argue that you will be saving\nLives of soldiers ...\nOr ... whatever country you are and and and third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost of going to war which uh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if one has no cost\nA then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour ... finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars you see the day that you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with\nArtificial male people for example but think about that will be back\nTo find out what George ... speaking go to the ... school down to the bottom including ...\nAnd now look back this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen thirty six harnessing the power of the mighty Colorado River Hoover Dam begins ending electricity over transmission lines spending two hundred and sixty miles and mountains or when the lights radios in Los Angeles\nThis week in Nineteen the New York Yankees right hander John Larson is the first no hitter in the history in the world series even better it was a perfect game that is

Nineteen Ninety two Eighteen year old Michele nap is watching television and her parents living room and peak skill New York and when she hears a thunderous crashed in the driveway she went outside to find a sizable hole in the rear end of her car a matching hole in the gravel driveway underneath the car and then the whole uh bowling ball size media right\nWhile media rights are fairly common in the media right hitting a car is nice car is after all very small object on a very large planet in fact as far as scientists now it is only happen twice before once in Illinois during the Nineteen thirties and once in St Louis and this week in Nineteen Ninety eight the U.S house of representatives\nVotes to proceed towards impeaching president\nBill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice\nBy December Nineteen Ninety eight the Republican led house had gathered enough information from an investigation committee to vote in favor of impeachment which in turn sent the case to the Senate Bill Clinton was the first president to be impeached by the house of representatives Andrew Johnson in Eighteen sixty eight Johnson was also acquitted that's your look back at this week in

Hooper a Google\nAmazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys a bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your flew back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many\nThings it's it's funny we we\nWe have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so well correct\nCorrect but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes out of batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nUm people aren't going to you're not going to make machines and had the same range of movements you're going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm\nNot like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's\nAn open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you've got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages me already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore because 'cause we could all communicate in the ...\nAnd it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nOr you invented the nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge\nSome ... ... ... so America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I I don't I Can't predict what that's going to win so it's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that is already Fishell intelligent you it is to be frightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw\nUnskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers a sibling bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nTo Nineteen eighty\nColor maybe forty Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year or so you every year you you put a million more workers and and yet that didn't make unemployment go up either it was just new technologies\nMore people are more jobs more well more prosperity so I think these ... I think anything that multiplies human ability is you know with a few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is\nThen you should support a law that makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything uh but our productivity will plummet\nSo that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you can do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's picking up by going to Jackson, Tennessee welcome to the

Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my part cost about it I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings\nAre just machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips in the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\nThe thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer complete go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is\nBut but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there that does any thinking at all it's it's one lives in zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off\nAt the speed of light um it's done with what's relative it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere's a thought experiment called the Chinese ruined problem and it's about it it goes like this there's this there's this room\nThat's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note
