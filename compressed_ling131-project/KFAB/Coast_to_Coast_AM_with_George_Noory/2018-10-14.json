north of I. eighty\nYeah not only not only do I believe it not only do I let it about anyone who reads the book guys almost compelled to go along with those conclusions because if there's one thing about me\nAre uh uh that I never do I never make a charge without support in it and uh I I have a tremendous amount of support for everything and I say I don't just say something without giving four or five examples to support what I'm saying\nAnd I talk about the incompetence of the prosecution in this case it's page after page after page there's just no way that anyone can read this book or without coming to the same conclusion and it's because\nOf these revelations the shocking revelations of incompetence in in my book outrage that the word of mouth has been such that the book has shot up the number one of the country because\nHere too for the American people have been blaming the jury for this verdict and of course the jury was very bad or don't get me wrong and I are on that at all very very bad\nThe many had been blaming the LAPD claiming the LAPD botched the case before I came to trial and but the main reason why this case was loss was the unbelievable and confidence that the prosecution in this case and you have to realize are and I think you know my background I'm very\nPro prosecution no one in this country was more supportive of these prosecutors in Iowa throughout the entire case I mean I even sent them a telegram\nOn the morning others summation trying to pump them up but I had a um an option here either not do the book and I actually I was talked into doing it by my editor and I'm happy now that he did a or write the book and be candid and uh\nThis is a very serious charge that I make and against the prosecution in this case supported in space so there's just just does no question about it\nMullah ... on either incompetent up there and watched every moment of the trial a lost a lot of sleep over and I presume you pretty much dude as much as you could the same thing yeah did you sit there is sort of beating your fist against the wall about how well\nYou know I also got on radio and TV I cut the to a minimum but I got on radio and TV and said many of the things that I'm saying in the book now so this is about Monday morning quarterback but I get on radio and television and say they've got to offer some of the evidence is very very incriminating evidence to like it was a conventional type of evidence that\nLaypeople you don't even have to be very bright lay people have been consistently basing verdicts have guilty off for the past two centuries it's the type of evidence that\nIs automatically associated even by people rather low intelligence or with guilt DNA is very good evidence don't get me wrong and I'm not criticizing the prosecution for presenting\nA DNA evidence in this case a but DNA is very complex very difficult to understand it and it was all an alien to this jury but evidence like Simpson or taking off when he was being charged with these murders and they're finding in his possession\nOf gun a passport a cheap disguise several fresh changes of honor clothing and in in ... a driver the eight thousand seven hundred fifty dollars in cash on him which he proceeds to tell the police the Simpson had given him inside the bronco\nThat Titus automatically associated by lay people off a with guilt and it was not offer it to this jury ever saw that evident\nNone of the low speed stuff uh Dominic Dunn the respected writer has publicly stated wanted to prosecute him didn't resent that evidence he says through his sources\nThat he's aware of shape conversations of Simpson during the bronco chase where he's talking on a cellular phone sobbing crying claiming to be an innocent man who framed is that why they don't use it\nIn the frame no no no not no no uh Dominic is partly true there he was denying guilt a big deal\nBig deal up [laughter] it means nothing\nWhen someone is charged with murder and they'd be an ideal of course they're going to do I get off who in the world expects them to confess that is the reason by the way that the prosecution did not offer that evidence nor did they offer a suicide note with absolutely reek with guilt I mean show me an innocent person charged with murder\nWho would write a note like that so they were afraid of it\nWell that yeah but but but for the wrong reasons in the suicide note\nSimpson denies guilt to also the thirty two minute interrogation of Simpson the day after the murders rent a incidentally I have the I was able to get a hold of the audio that thirty minute interrogation and I've transcribe it and it's an independent of the book is the only book on the Simpson case that has interrogation ...\nWhere he admits dripping with blood on the night of these murders has no idea how he got caught but in that\nInterrogation ie also denies guilt and the prosecutors you're right they kept that out they kept that out all of that because they didn't ... this is what they said you can't make this stuff it's too far out to make up dark and says it in his book they didn't want the jury to hear Simpson denying guilt without is taking the witness stand ... but aren't\nThe jury already knew that Simpson had denied guilt I mean they knew he pled not\nGuilty that's why they were having a trial for Pete's sake I mean\nIf the guy confessed if he had pled guilty there would not have been a trial you're going to keep out extremely powerful evidence like this or just to prevent the jury from hearing something that they already know that it's mind boggling and this is the mentality of these prosecutors good people the good guys lost here\nThis is the mentality of these people were representing the state of the Simpson case and and people wonder why this guy's out in the golf course with a smile on his face you're going to keep out for instance the passport the cheap disguise\nSeveral fresh changes of honor clothing and the fact that our colleagues has all this money on him which Simpson gave him all this cash because he denying guilt because he's denying yeah I mean the jury doesn't know that he was denying get why are they having a trial it's mind boggling\nI don't know what about the civil trial and all of this that didn't come out in that trial will come out we would not in the civil trial I can\nGive you a virtual one hundred percent guarantee that um the plaintiffs lawyers like Daniel Patrick ... whom I spoke to they will be offering that evidence anyone would offer that evidence why these prosecutors did and\nWhy they're so incompetent I don't know 'cause I keep hearing that around the country why are they someone competent why didn't they do this and I can't tell them I mean it's like asking me\nA wire Michael Jordan and Larry Bird dog a great basketball players I Can't tell you I can tell you that they are but uh the genesis of why they're so great uh I don't know but yeah\nThat evidence will be offered like virtually any other prosecutor in the country would have done if they had handled the case that evidence will be offered during the civil trial and I'm very confident that there'll be a judgment against Simpson uh uh in that civil trial the question is whether he's already spirited his money out of the country and they're gonna be able to like on the judgment that none of the real problem\nDuring and Clark both not a very in your face kind of a presentation and a lot of people translated that to competence and they apparently didn't look a little bit deeper at some of the things we just talked about a with regard to the evidence not presented\nActually they were not in the face they should have been a lot more in the face they were much or too casual a laid back they were extremely casual and laid back they may have been a little in the face a outs\nBy the presence of the jury when they were talking to a judge Ito in front of the jury they couldn't possibly have have been more dissident\nImagine in your eyes what this guy's Simpson did to these two victims viciously stabbing him to death you know their life blood draining out of them the horror and the fright in their eyes last moments when they were trying to survive imagined that now imagine\nNow imagine Marsha Clark during jury selection telling this jury well this started in your mind that I just told you he is such a sympathetic guy okay\nThen telling the jury this is not a fun place for me to be making this up this stuff from the transcript if she tells the jury this is not a fun place for me to be art that's like telling the jury you know I really don't want to be prosecuting the sky but I have been assigned the case so what can I Do\nThen she tells the jury or you may not like me for bringing this case I'm not winning any popularity contest for doing so art psychologically nothing could be worse than to tell a jury that you're not winning any popularity caught as because if you're telling them that that's like telling them the majority of people outside that courtroom\nDon't even want this guy to be prosecuted and by necessary extension if they come back with a verdict a guilty they are going against the majority of people garden in his final summation\nUnbelievably telling the jury nobody wants to hurt this guy we don't you know there's nothing personal here but the law's the law if you're telling the jury that nobody wants to hurt this guy art you're telling them that virtually everyone outside that courtroom his point for him\nSo innocent she did set up a popularity contest by saying that one which she lost\nMhm yes very a very good articulation but they were not forceful at all the prosecution has the burden of proof and it's difficult to meet that bird and if you're not forceful they were not forceful here's Darden in his summation telling the jury\nOn this question of whether Mr Simpson was guilty or not guilty that's a tough question and I'm Glad I'm not in your shoes aren't you realize what that was that that is saying that's almost telling the jury that this was a reasonable doubt case\nAnd and the prosecutor should be conveyed to the jury of course [laughter] that that the evidence of guilt is so overwhelming that you folks shouldn't have any difficulty at all coming back with a guilty verdict here's Darden saying boy that's a tough question I'm Glad I'm not in your shoes\nIt's beyond incompetence art or the book has many many instances where we're getting into the area of unprecedented unheard of bizarre unique and it's because of these revelations that the media did not see the media was seen what they expected to see what they expected to see was competent prosecutors taking care of business they\nDidn't see what it was actually in front of them now that they're seeing the American people are seeing what actually happened during this trial this is why the word of mouth on outrageous such that a child the number one\nSure a clerk obviously at the beginning of the case she had a slam dunk right right right ah do you think at any point during the case she realized or did you never realize that it was becoming less and less slam dunk is they went along\nWell you know I wasn't down there but by everyone I've spoken to near the end they were very very worried and they would have settled for a hung jury at the end but at the beginning you're right uh she thought I was a slam dunk case right but not at the end not at the end\nHow [noise] how much [noise] I Need help I mean I think I think that having someone who was the

back products want to clarify what white shirts saying something about cutting himself without her phone the media was saying that and they they made that assumption\nAh he did say something and they thirty given interrogation about going to the bronco\nTo pick up the cellular phone he did not that he cut himself and I thought they asked him specifically how did you cut yourself is exact words the whole thirty two imminent interrogation that than the book you said I don't know later in the interview they asked them to get how did you cut yourself to the exact words were I have no idea Matt oh he is not the cut himself in the southern\nPart of accent do the prosecutors try the tactics that you fault them for because they were dealing with the jury system that's made up primarily of sympathizers OJ and people who are not quote average citizens and quote in other words people who can take a you know several months off work to attend to trial\nWell I don't really know what that means because uh if these people weren't the brightest people in the world with which you question that may imply that all the more reason why you offer conventional evidence like flight you know after he was being charged with these murders he took off\nThe fact that he cut himself and have no idea how I got got caught the fact that he writes a suicide note I mean you know when you're ...\nCharged with murder or if you're innocent you're going to be blazing mad that you're being charged a desperately want to prove your innocence find out who murdered the mother of two children instead he becomes very passive and he writes his farewell letter that really exactly like a suicide note\nUh he refers to himself as the last person these things are incompatible with innocent so in answer to your question that's all the more reason why they should have offered these conventional uh items of evidence I'm not saying they should have offered DNA but not to the exclusion of these conventional\n... talking about DNA per second all these other issues inside right I'm just an average person does um but I understand numbers why didn't the DNA evidence alone convicted\nOkay now that again we get into absolute extreme or a or incompetence here um the defense every time\nEvery time they made an argument to explain away incriminating evidence the prosecution either did not respond at all which is virtually unprecedented or they responded in a very anemic fashion\nThe main pieces of evidence in this case other than that that tape but I just told you you give me a hundred dollars and yellow pad I would've convicted him on that thirty two minute interrogation alone but the main\nItem of evidence against Simpson\nWas his blood was that the murder saying okay there was blood on the ... gate a which was also his\nSounded later though yeah no no no no it was collected later not found later no it was it was it was seen that night by five detectors all of whom will testify not collected the night and that was not collecting\n'cause then is following the criminal list and he did not pick it up that night and things like that happened that just incompetence to use picking up blood everywhere I mean it was awash in blood there and he did not pick up the evidence from the gate it would seem that night there was even a photograph of two of the three blood stains that night taken by the LAPD that night out\nThey claimed that the stands on the ... were planted\nA talking about the defense aren't they claim that the glove in Rockingham was planted they claim that blood and the Broncos planted they claim that ... that the socks and Simpsons bedroom but we're we're a planet\nBut even these defendants who I mean defense attorneys who possess the going at the ten thousand elephants even they even they did not have the guts to allege that the five blood drops in form which were immediately to the left or the killers bloody shoe prince\nLeaving the crime scene even they did not allege that they were planted here's what they alleged\nThe lives of those blood drops there were exposed to the elements and lost all of their DNA\nBecause they were last with element bacteria sunlight what have you and later on when they were on a cotton swab teaches at FIT scientific investigation division of LAPD a pie protect\nThat those five blood drops became contaminated with blood from Simpsons reference while they had no proof of that no evidence but they said they the\nThe F. I. D. with a cesspool of contamination and possibly happen which is not that they had no evidence in any of that in any event\nMarsha Clark then did not come back and make two very very obvious arguments I'm no expert on DNA but I Know enough about being able to tell you this\nThat that if if in fact\nIf in fact there had been cross contamination and she didn't make these arguments those five blood drops would have had a BPA in them eat EPA is an anti coagulating it's a preservative that is added to blood taken from a ... for up from a suspects are right but in the reference wild and they put ...\nThe only type a jury that you can't turn around art\nIs the type a jury who state of mind is even though we know OJ's guilty or we don't care uh we like O. J. blacks have been discriminated against by white throughout the years we're going to get voted to free murders but let me tell you it would be extremely difficult to find even one juror without outrageous state of mind much less all twelve\nAnd and looking at the backgrounds with these jurors for instance The Simpsons for person was in the Nineteen Ninety LA county employee of the year\nI'm listening to what they said on radio and TV\nReading a book written by three of them I get no sense that even one of them had that state of mind and I don't believe that for one single moment\nSo this was not the best jury but they would have responded to an a plus performance what happened here is that the prosecution allowed this jury to live with their conscience they did not eliminate for this jury all possibilities of symptom been found not guilty\nAlright uh had not the whole of the Rodney King business and the the riots and all the rest of the been hanging over this which was right or how much difference with that ...\nWell no question about it that affected the verdict but again again in very late we come back to the unbelievable incompetence of these prosecuting here's what Cochran debt and\nIt was duplicitous on his part and went right over the head of ... who's a black went right on his head\n... Cochran argued to this jury a police frame up from their experience of police brutality police brutality and ... frame of our two completely different types of misconduct dark never distinguish these two types\nAnd the jury's mind uh what the black community has been experiencing throughout the years from a small segment of the LAPD and other major forces around the country maybe two three four percent that stay in the blue uniform of the other officers what they'd been experiencing\nIs excessive force police brutality and then of course the please lie to cover it up okay that's what they've been experiencing frame ups frame up by the police for burglaries robberies rapes murders\nVirtually virtually unheard of it's not that it's\nNot common I Know this I've talked to enough black\nI've talked to people who work in the black community that's almost unheard of and yet ... did not see this issue\nTime magazine did not see the times said\nWell obviously it was easy for this jury to buy the frame of argument all the jury had to replay in their mind is the tape of Rodney King get be getting beaten by the LAPD has if Rodney King getting getting beaten by the LAPD in the same thing as the LAPD is if the LAPD beating Rodney King\nIs essentially the same as they're framing OJ Simpson trial totally completely different types of police misconduct\nAnd it's my belief without knowing\nThat this jury back on the jury one was thinking this is the LAPD we know we can't trust them you know there's a reasonable doubt or they may have framed OJ instead of thinking to themselves wait a while yeah maybe we can't trust the LAPD for certain things but frame ups\nThat's absurd I was on a San Diego radio last week and a fifty five year old black fifty five year old black woman called in and she was carrying and to me you know about the the the LAPD in the San Diego police department mystery blacks and I said no ma'am\nAnd and she believe there is a frame of and all that I said man I'm going to ask you a question now and I want you to think about it I don't want you to answer right away I think about it before you answer your fifty five years of age I Want you to get look back into your past as it ever happened to you or any member of your family any relative any close friend have they ever been framed in other words are completely innocent the police come along\nHave ever been framed for a burglary or a robbery or rape or arson or murder I'm not exaggerating art she paused for five ten seconds and these were words no she hadn't thought about it you fall short and\nAnd Darden should have pointed this out to the jury it would have been in a looming eighty moment for all of them he didn't do it and went right over his head\nDuring look we're near the top they are but I Want to ask you very quickly once the trial got underway was there you're targeting\nThat I Can't tell you I mean I I read I I don't know that that I Would always say you're you're\nTired aren't getting I mean targeting by both sides were they both are or were they both playing games and blunders off they didn't think were a favorable to\nTheir that oh yeah of course that it's not an every trial it's called a a a a primary challenge where you don't have to give any reason whatsoever if you don't like the way someone looks at you the color of their tie\nNo no I'm I'm Talking about wants to trial was underway\nTrials underway yeah there was a little bit of that uh but it wasn't too successful because Ito was not a discharging people jurors unless he came up with some evidence of possible impropriety you know one of them was\nWell I'm recalling the or the ... the er the anonymous letter\nYeah right but I mean he was under the impression that perhaps this woman uh what's going to write a book and I wonder if he was or not I don't know but there was some evidence that went in that direction and uh yes the defense want it to get rid of her of course 'cause she was perceived to be pro prosecute needle you know didn't just willy nilly a discharge or\nAren't learning where the top of the hour give me thirty more minutes 'cause I've got a couple more questions

temperatures falling back into the low forties some snow possible by morning with all the hospitals accurate whether ... meteorologist\nWhen guards and said I've been prosecuting bad costs for seven years I started thinking well wait a while is is this in the middle of the night or with the goblins out I mean how can I haven't heard about this so I called down the office and\nSpoke to two fellow deputy da's down there who worked alongside Darden in the special investigations division of the da's office which is responsible for prosecuting police misconduct cases here's what they told me\nThat in the seven years leading up to this trial Nineteen eighty seven the Nineteen Ninety four garden tried one case in one case only it was a misdemeanor case wasn't even a felony case a and he lost it it's a thirty ninth and don't and street case thirty ninth adult and there was a duplex there\nThat was believed to be a crack house and the police went in there and trashed it looking for crack and they were prosecuted for vandalism and dark and handle it and lost that case and if you look at his book\nYou mentioned a lot of cases in his id\nAh but the only case that he mentions taken the trial if you've read very closely as the thirty ninth and don't speak a so he didn't really have a sufficient background\nSo then what are you saying because of color\nWell I don't know I don't really don't know why does brought it not not before those\nSeven years I don't know what his background is he says that he had prosecuted quite a few homicide cases and uh uh he may be telling the truth I don't know about that and he may have been successful but I can tell you that when he told the jury I've been prosecuting bad cops for seven years he was not telling the truth he was investigating bad cops or seven years but not prosecuting them\nAs long as public image was lousy uh as I Want to the trial I fully expect to garden at any moment to go jumping across the room and slugs somebody\n[laughter] and and and that is what it looked like he he did have a chip on a fault [laughter]\nThat that that's pretty colorful Louis articulated there\nAren't let me give you one one just unbelievable example of of of incompetence of between the two prosecutors surveys and it just it just illustrates a ... and again the book is three hundred and fifty six pages of this but this type of thing you're aware of the ... of the van ... ah bringing the vial of blood back to Iraq and have your where the whole the whole issue\nOh yeah okay um let me just\nBriefly tell you why why he did it normally you collect blood from a suspect in a homicide cases a couple of days later a week later a monthly or sometimes even a couple of years later 'cause there's no statute of limitations for the crime and murdered\nAnd I'm a ... so it's it's it's not within hours after the murders as was the case here now the the the the defense argued that he should have booked that vial of blood immediately and he's running and he could have done that however\nNormally you do not get a D our number which you need to book items of evidence until the the uh the evidence at the crime scene has been collected by the criminalist pursuant to the search warrant here that hadn't been done yet\nA fun was still at Rockingham first he has been a Bundy collecting evidence and evidence is booked sequence surely off by numbers so if the book that while\nIt would have been item number one but what the reason he didn't do that if he had no way of knowing what number off on was given to the items of evidence that he was collecting at Bundy and walking him it would have messed up the whole numbering system\nWhat it would have made the argument that you'd carried it around and had opportunity a impossible\nYeah right ah but yes but it's also it was in advisable but I mean how could he ever dreamed that people like Shaq and Cochran or out they're accusing him of framing someone for murder I mean here's a guy twenty eight years on the forests not one citizen complaint against them and twenty eight years he's about to retire and a few months with his wife Rita to his farm in Indiana\nAnd he's going to frame OJ Simpson it's mind boggling you free you plant evidence in a capital case in California and testified falsely you can get the death penalty yourself on her one twenty eight of the California penal code the prosecutors never even made that argument in in in any event\nFong had already given item number one to the spot of blood above the door handle and uh so so I'm a fan\nOut or brings the vile blood back to fall in any detective will tell you that when they turn over items of evidence to the to the criminalist in their mind that's the equivalent of ... I just I'm giving you the background as to why he brought it back here why bought it back to the Rockingham survived torture him on the day after the murders but here's the point that I Want to get into\nThe defense argument of please frame up and conspiracy and all that at the heart of that very argument was banned that are bringing the vile blood back\nIn what they claim does that then I met her in his evil co conspirators to blood out of that violin planted ... had Rockingham and Bundy was a major major major issue with the trial post trial post trial several the juror said that it was the most suspicious thing that the LAPD did during the tire case okay\nNow there are several arguments that the prosecution could have made to knock down this core defense argument about men had to bring in the wild blood back the Rockingham I mentioned several in the book I'll just give you two very brief ones right here\nIf he was going to bring the vial of blood back the rock and obviously he put it in his suit pocket he wouldn't put it in a large ... thereby advertising to everyone that he was bringing something onto the premise is that just common sense on number two\nNumber two van out are\nAlready knew that hundreds upon hundreds of reporters and other members of the media had already congregated at Rockingham an Bundy their cameras blanketing the premise is picking up for the evening news all the movements of everyone on the state there are helicopters up above filming everything down below obviously\nPlanting would have been absolutely impossible there are many many other argument\nNow what if I told you what if I told you list\nAnd that's because it's unbelievable there's no other additive than in the eight hours of the nation that these two prosecutors gave neither Clark nor Darden said one single word to try to knock down this court defense argument about ban\nThat are bringing the vial of blood factor Rockingham they never once even touched on the issue I check the transcript three times I had my wife check is unbelievable I said there's got to be some attempt to knock this now 'cause it goes to the heart of the defense cave\nArt when you get to the point when you don't have an open up your mouth and author one single solitary word on an absolutely critical issue the question is how does it get any worse we're not talking incompetence here we're talking beyond incompetent if you didn't show up for work hard\nI wouldn't say that you were incompetent incompetence of showing up for work and doing a bad job\nRight well we didn't even argue on it but they want to be showing up for what about the angle that a a ride Bennett are carried it out in the ... but a lot of people thought well ferman socked away a little bit of it remember the sock business and took it over and planted it that's what a what\nI thought the glove ... the the glove they All right you know there were four teen uniformed officers that arrived at the Bundy murder scene before from it before from in front of the arrived rapid two o'clock that's right and these these murders happened around a oath whether there's a disc right there there's a division of the window but but somewhere somewhere between\nTen Fifteen and ten thirty five PM in the evening of given the twelve correct the first officer arrives right after midnight okay they're Eighteen uniformed officers that arrived there before for him and all of them saw only one glove so there was no second glove there\nFor for him and to pick up\nAnd deposit at Rockingham ... even if you wanted to even if you want it to frame Simpson by planning to go out there was no second glove there unless Eighteen officers would have been willing to take the stand and commit perjury for ferman\nNow mind you Eighteen officers\nThey all they all made the statement at ... in in front of a a a internal affairs but what about Clark only called two out of the team to the witness stand instead of calling the other sixteen she had the other sixty and there she knew their names she didn't bother calling all Eighteen the more you call that stand the greater the likelihood\nThat all Eighteen are going to commit perjury in a capital case\nJust to help someone most of whom they didn't even know from\nWhy didn't you do then incompetence gross author complete I just I could give you an example here on the ... blood issues or nothing could have been more important than that she didn't even open up from out once\nAll right well so then the bottom line is after all this uh OJ walks in just about everybody else's life on both sides is more or less ruined\nI'm try I'm doing my best by the way in the book not not intentionally but to help mark permanent fact mark for him and a mother called me today down the office and I called her back she wasn't home but she wants to thank me for what I've said in the book about uh about from and you see here's another area\nOn the ferment situation when it came out when it was in the first place the prosecution themselves should've should've made for him and cough up that he's used the N. word they knew he had they should have known that they had been given to the statements by the defense from credible people no ax to grind that he used the N. word\nAlso disability pension hearings he used the N. word several years earlier so what you do in a case like that preempt\nYou you ... the exact word you put it on yourself you put it behind it becomes a dead issue the ferment tapes don't even surface if they did they wouldn't have even been admissible because they wouldn't be impeaching anything not only didn't the prosecutors do that art but then the compound the problem when the defense\nBrought in all this evidence instead of trying to mitigate the damage they joined in the vilification of ferment here's Marsha Clark talking to the jury and find those to me he said do we wish this man did not exist on the face of this planet answer yes yes\nHere's why from his mother called me and and and and and why people are learning a little bit more about from it because it's all in the book it didn't come out of the trial mark ferman used to be a racist no question about it but it's not that bad guy in Nineteen Ninety four that's when the ferment tapes ended\nOr the last time and those ferment tapes he had used the N. word was in Nineteen eighty eight six years earlier in Nineteen Ninety four mark ferment had black friends he was getting up to three mornings a week playing basketball at five in the morning with fellow black officers more importantly art I've confirmed this\nMark from Anne in Nineteen Ninety four worked very hard to free a black man by the name of Eric Harris was charged with the murder of a white man John Stewart when he came upon evidence favorable to Harris in fact he got the ... office to dismiss the charges against terrorists\nTo be you know I Love flowers from\nThe ...\nYou can like you know I was already

that it's no longer banging what the hell's going on here and that is that the tenor of Lewis in San Diego says there are\nWhat's really going on with flight eight hundred\nThis isn't meant to be funny but there seems to be some kind of Roswell mentality at work here one government agencies as they've found traces of a possible explosive device a little while later another agency says no there's no evidence of a bomb\nWe're told they're tracking the pain of the black boxes then it's reported they've recovered one of them still later we're told will they lost it\nThe FBI claims about a hundred I witnesses reported seeing something resembling a flair for someone else says no there's no indication of missile was involved for every major disaster I recall the last Thirty years or so\nNo official information was released into who they were positive they had the facts straight\nHis flight eight hundred a case of no one having the facts straight\nIs one agency trying to cover up something without being able to let the other agencies involved know what they're covering up\nOr is it simply right hand not knowing what's left and doing it doesn't even know the left hand exist please don't let them hit a weather balloon here is it just one case will never really be told what really a gerd or is it too soon to tell with all respect to those involved\nI Can't help but wonder Lewis in San Diego\nI'm with you Lewis this whole thing gets stranger by the moment\nAh what seemed to be a straight on investigation um I just I I don't know what to make of it I just don't know what

off over over the water\nWell now remember that this flight a was late by an hour this flight should have been um should have been about an hour farther out into the Atlantic\nExactly my point um that that would have gone off without any real witnesses or any trace that was right and I think that ah someone who was trying to blow the plaintiff and make them sort of fame it would have had that happen you know on the ground or five ... [noise]\nI you know what I think I I'm beginning to think the FBI believes it was a missile they're all over Long Island right now checking with people renting boats and all the rest of it now why would they be doing that the only thing you can do to an airplane from boat as far as shoulder fired missiles that's it\nWell I think your point certainly I Hope that that black box wind surfing and give them some information\nI I think a better question is whether it already has surfaced\nBut all the people who\nI I hate to be suspicious I really do because I Want to trust our government but I'm a frankly a it was ... then all of a sudden no more things well one good reason you wouldn't have any more things is there is nothing down there to paying\nWell we following the what happened the lives of the people who are witnesses who feel they thought flare or a Mets fan on\nWell we should thank you very much the testimony that I find most credible of all art to military pilots according to ABC who are on a commercial flight and watched a missile rise to flight ... eight hundred\nDot com [noise] no we took you back to the past on art bell somewhere in time\nRadio of living to live in a way of a B [noise]\nNot do on screen open line talk radio you'd get it as it comes wildcard lined you're on the air\nUh yes art ... an Nashville hello Anne Hi [noise] and I ... that\nThat's all we can do and [laughter] that's all we've got\nGood morning after the crash the President Clinton\nYes on TV we mean when he talked about flight one hundred that way and that's what he said yeah\nWell you know the man usually look pretty good liaison de de ... hey look\nAwful and devastated he looked horrify\nAnd I've been thinking about it ever since I\nI I\n... ... ... ... they have written said some kind of threat after work cut the White House for the the threat like well we can do is if you don't do it with we say\nOh maybe something like this could have been air force one\nBecause it the seven forty seven\nSure sure yes sure the answer is yes they could've ... wouldn't want the American people to know what\nThey tell us that um you know that's a really good question um I think the answer to that has no they would not tell us\n\nI really do I'm Sorry to say that but I Believe they would not tell us and you you've made you brought up a very a very very good point would they tell us about such a threat I think the answer is no\nYou know have the price for his safety ...

people and there was an explosion\nAbout a hundred people including two uh ABC News last night reported on a commercial airliner there were two military pilots who saw their words a missile go toward that plane\nRight well what I'm suggesting is perhaps the wind was hit by a meteor\nMeteors come from above\nWell that's true but at night and with the going across the sky it's possible they might have seen this but it looks like a plan to admit when I read and glowing\nNo I'm not real good at calculating stuff but what do you suppose the odds are of a media that appears derives from the ground hitting a seven forty\nSeven well certainly not one that I kind of comes from the ground but certainly well above that might be you know let's or\n... or the testimony is from a hundred people it came from the ground I mean I I I'm Sorry your theory is sounds cool but it came from the ground\nWhat became the ground I don't think it can be a millionaire but certainly I think it's it's worth considering that\nWhy why uh-huh well\nPeople that I'm kind of blowing object going through the guy I mean they tend to say well what could that\nBe well and then later but um\nBut that isn't what

than you know they don't want to know in a box Deuce favorites you already love\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate experience\nNow was this before or after you became a Hitler therapists\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your hoping he will get you go what did you experience how did you know it just said\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room a going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this in my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself\nThat said\nI think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhat I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs one of them yes and but you can experience at first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the information in me why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want to do anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because there's certainly they heal meal you know he was playing because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an addict and mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved\nAnd there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits or this or that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you\nHow people come and I called it an afro tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from how great it is urging him only twenty four people can attend it's a\nWorld renowned as being\nThe center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for a these Akron ... and\nUm what is that controlled holistic environmental chamber in other words each person's in personal isolation\nBooth and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization to kind of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNelly ... like a cubicle or an identity and a decline or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off\nCompletely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like I'm\nIn many ways the same concept behind um the float chambers exempt in this case you are not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nYou hands headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them in their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated I mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones

beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm\nA way that throughout history people had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like revelations begins with I was in the spirit and if you look back through all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nTheir their consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits and that is in itself\nA form of out of body exploration it's just that was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that on the way it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu Buddhist text [noise]\nUm [noise] to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was\nBeyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that use for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese\nBut they they cover a lot of territory they also how the go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nA mind mirror it's just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we

one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is\nResearch done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people how they have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional self\nRight and have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves

[noise]\n\nThis is ... ...\nTo be a part in boxing because now more than ever really powerful voices from anything you've\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical\nBody because\nYou have and it doesn't mean you've accident your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at a for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nThat gap I ... on because that happened I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles or using that amount of money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially\n... this is what I have\nFound and what many other um experiences have seen unexplored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is ... we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLosing ... image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having on Syrian\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream began or they may be running in their non\nPhysical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological ... machine and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people are only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell at least you wanted to ask the question like how did you hear in their ... year would you go into and it'll be an arms that question and have you ever tried dead and I'm curious how did you hear me now to me\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you\nKnow one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us\nOr we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present and when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOf what's going on\nI think this is very important because no one's\nTelling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or ... anyone other than yourself\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say\nEducational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody that's an avid believer and anything like that a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you\nDo see experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy it's you are going to create it\nWhen your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and\nA negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well well he or creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment\nAnd you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had lived one once where I went it was a dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they go and let her cycling helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\nRide your own motorcycle and it was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection as anything and it was the name was no there isn't a premonition of anything can happen it just it was as if I had gone into a future convention\nWhich looks pretty bleak the honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because I mean people can't each other yeah and I don't know is that an adult locked out of body travel most likely\nMhm well it could have been there wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object or there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there was non consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look at them\nThese what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right to gravity\nWe're used to air you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my

I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nI saw where it was that and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to just singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in manatees Springs Colorado and he was hunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love the story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California at that time\nAnd my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions\nSight unseen I Swear\nBecause they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion well what happened is\nI actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and your she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown\n[laughter] extremely\nRun down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon\nI'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you well after us and\nYou know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter] yeah\nI actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps\nDo what you want he goes my mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nSong about it just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest state so I don't think anybody's ever seen\nAnything like that while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was\nEthic my goodness you didn't bring Malone literally\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the ghost\nOf surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary\nFriend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it we'll see started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that Phillies sue you know innocent\nBut then\nI I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old was your nephew at the time at this topics okay and\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered\nIn scratch marks and he was leading\nOkay he was bleeding and it\nLooked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt and he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had since his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had to cut\nThe ear off of our cat and he said that still made him do it oh\nDear you said stew sorry he\nKept calling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died\nNow the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh it was\nAwful he said to me stupid doesn't

coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional storage or as we can tell but she's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado so Stephanie tell us a little bit more about\nYou when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nKnow I'm I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs\nFor spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not fight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down\nTheir weapons and there was peace here forever\nUntil the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and what have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um natives actually hurt the town after that and that's why it's so hot that\nMake sense to me [laughter] yeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter]\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and\nI Am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened okay a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this\nVery own body it was awful he's let's suicide um come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started\nTalking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to\nUm process and they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the ...\nThat that's why they're so there are so many um artist answer singer musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first\nMoved here a and I see it happening to other people but that's one of them my a godsend\nMoved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help him out he was gone through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the ... the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the boats that come out at midnight you know but Tom or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for those of you wants to see them with your eye\nIs at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nIs a transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hidden lends\nItself to the shadows\nDoes that make sense yes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast\nAnd it only I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we

I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea\nAbout the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\n[noise] it's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhat I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs one of them\nYes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system mhm\nI only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the pistons information in me why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because especially they heal meal you know he was playing because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an at a convention is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits or this or that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer\nThemselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really to tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nOh great in Virginia I'm only twenty\nFour people can attend it's a world renowned as being\nThe center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm

brain synchronization to kind of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNelly did like a cubicle or an identity and a decline or well how do you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that\nBecause you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nThe float chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit\nAnd all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nDo you have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talked to them and the control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated I mean they don't feel
