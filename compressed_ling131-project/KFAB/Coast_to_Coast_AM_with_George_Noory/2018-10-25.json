parcel unchecked Callahan Fox News police in Los Angeles report they have lettered safe and handed over to the FBI another suspicious package this well founded a male sorting facility addressed with the California offices of congresswoman Maxine Waters\nBut I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing this to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know thing he's created an environment so that somebody\nWould be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait and get the official verdict from\nAuthorities intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked but\nWe have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously bake these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever whoever it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and uh George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that what you had on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this is a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media not not coast to coast but the media has definitely 'cause George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying\nListen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go and his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their ... their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because\nI Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left\nThat did this and you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials doing their job then wants their job is completed and they determine who's done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stuff done but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ... we will talk this week\nAnd see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... is a heinous

perpetrators of a very short period of time as being very very high\nUp for purely ... I mean these are all unexploded devices\nThat me and all kinds of of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities they\nProbably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the ...\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera at\nThe post office or ...

F. A. B. another package\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George story with you while a couple of years ago as I was chatting with our executive producer Lisa lying on our senior producer Tom Dan Hi sir we kicked around the idea of\nDoing a show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with him we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom ... has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight Tom\nUh I pick people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the show is to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to trick you aren't really creative\nI remember when the late Roger leader came on oh and I could not gas him at all\nHe had you and I think in\nHoney and was going to ... he won't even was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three guests will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one\nOr in this night will go by really quick and one more quick question for you goes to goes next Wednesday Halloween Night or you're putting together a number of ... ... email ghost stories from people and will have the actual people on the year with me that night\nUh it of course we'll take calls from our listeners to what their ghost stories so we're ready to go there ready to go to ship out to be a fun show we're going to ... okay Thanks Tom\nLet's open up the first secret door [noise]\nActually I tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on in and let's see who you are hello there\nAnd oh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\n[noise] well my my buddy up\nOh I owned\nHer\nIt's written by reading a mortgage stance in Friedman\nBoy am I allowed\n[noise] I I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but maybe for I'm going to look to mail on\nEr and yes you are we need we need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\n[noise] well I Am sort of retiring I Am much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I Know engagement in January November and December\nI Can't believe it too much about going anywhere\n[laughter] well I tell you why we love your stand and I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my tape recorder out I once interviewed Stanton Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some libel dense with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big beer and I think\nSo at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the ... case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've\nCome to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right when Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word begat looks like they're about one point six planets per star opera galaxy star and our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion stars\nAll that means is one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course we're not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from there is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of farmers comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth\nNow we realize I was the clear fusion for example ... you can get\n... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a special bus or above the world was created in four thousand B. C.\nThat's right can't be too late beings around you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be seen as\nThey are just a little the little uh our ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her for me [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize that the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that people see others coming here\nBecause apparently they seem to be all over the place and what was the result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere on migration colonization maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that are very throws a climate that they put in incarcerated people you\nKnow like yeah like a ... boy guys and brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's you're standing you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet\nBut in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on the wall we think there's one point six planets for stars so lead to a huge number of planets and\n[noise] you know they're probably come in here uh I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand flights you know if there are life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact and the white\nHouse lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped [laughter] and and so uh what\nMost of us have learned that it's more complex place for them we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of planet of the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number oh\nOh no [laughter] no ... and\nSo we and you can tell from another thing or the military budget on apply to about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that at all these\nPeople don't get the goodies of are on their work\nUh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature but it appears to be close to what it is I'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to them in the universe and you know I've gone through the sequence of I Know huh how

bottom I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this and I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing\nThis to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made you know thing ... he created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that\nYou don't know that we need to wait and get the official verdict from our authorities\nIntelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroke\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever

a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely 'cause George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody\nAnd you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre ... one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep this keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and\nIt won't ever did this with somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag\nIt'd be somebody on the left that did this\nYou got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut out we let the intelligence officials doing their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the

can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue and less stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know
