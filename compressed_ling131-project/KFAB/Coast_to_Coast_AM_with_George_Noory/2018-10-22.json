it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people\nAlways reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's convincing that something over the years has been around us and it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first year can you be kept the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business\nAnd you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if you have Twenty years of police officer ... years investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent what will finance you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within face\nSix to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California and I coordinate down the area to Hooper which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big store in Hooper that live ... miles away who saw one coming into town I started thinking about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd when the Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and drop the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man his\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes\nThey immediately accept and\nHarvey and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with here and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about uh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California uh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things\nDo an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder chased him off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd Everytime I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up so when you hear these stories\nThese campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about from these guys and say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... of just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big put the kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there's never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it than fat\nSeems to be a there are instances where ... where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they describe them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill the thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big for world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill me if I'm going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and a invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n[noise] yeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man\nThat have a lot of injury to because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it\nAnd it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it but a lot of people just to prove it and say oh you know it was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times\nAnd they and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just bone and get in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nA that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania will be so prominent than the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was a center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived at the time\nOh exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first the stabbed push\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings well that verse back or be with Ohio is a friend and I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year\nFor safety still to this

I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she had been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck\nOr that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise you know us acting president ever left the country on so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was and what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you grab me my father was a an open one he would he drove a landing a graph from ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was the most complex grab my judging them imagining him being there and some of the scene you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the capitalize version of what the world knows about the u._s.

somebody\nNews radio a limit to the\nBeach [noise]\n\nSo Lynn Vincent I interrupted you before the break we you're about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYet a commander passionate lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to\nPresent the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make ...\nUm\nWell it was it and then more sort of had wished after the war first had a shift in Nineteen fifty two in Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English and\nIt was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from men or how she met a point of view and there was a chapter on it voted in Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger or in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot it was a commander\nWho cared for his men it was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against\nProtocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors ask for radar and more technology for his that marine because that makes them or you didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of it is rather sad commanders\nGo down to sell the grave for lack of technology they're carrying had why he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called on um we were also able to interview his granddaughter\nA and it even more information about his later life half for\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because the U.S Navy I mean they took the extraordinary step of having him testify at a court martial for captain McVeigh and then uh\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of of how things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm Sarah I Want to get to the moments right after these torpedoes slam into the side of the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out um\nYou know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a note distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes hit\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for how she amount obey the clouds just part in the movie came out for just a moment and not for him to see the silhouette of the ship and so you know after it was struck\nThe power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first step of the\nYou know the ... the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle station they had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happen to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war and they were having this leisurely\nA sale they think across the Philippines see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rats between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nOr while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would drain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others would you take small for it is that it's the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it that then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels first blood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line\nAnd they would just go out of their heads and um they die very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh that must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it did some quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have service to finish them off\nYou have a somewhere as pilots who winds up testifying at the ...\nMarshall later or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention we've got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bart Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who were wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that kind of explosion coming from Milo and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times and yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd have still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know his son who you know the gentleman richer Francis he passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time\nAnd we're at the one father and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are a lot about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster and us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors and to what came

ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but or is it an accident that this story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day I'm In well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the time they do not believe it was an accident so the rat to occurred beginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five\nAnd the war ended on August fourteenth between that time zones fourteenth and fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nThey did not announce that Indianapolis had been on the news papers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nAnd tell VJ Day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headline on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines you know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small article\nLet the Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that

it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony gentleman I mentioned earlier the commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know film was contacted by the navy and he called me and there they found the ship and I didn't know what he was\nTalking about it for them [laughter] and so you know dating my back okay yeah\nRealize what was going on very quickly started I mean this was something that several people before Petro group which has the vessel that responsible\nThe ship there'd been several attempts and they were the first ones to be successful and what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we released this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so bill and I spent the next\nThree hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that their shift had been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's their reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened in that it happened in their lifetime or what [laughter]\nMostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a famine Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship saying he had a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck\nOn winning [laughter] you\nKnow across the board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd and land you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information they were they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get this story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it with any pain or twenty sixteen and we said while they're we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship so they were saying that that was happening they thought that was the ship fall\nFor getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out I'm also as a treaty cruiser as Sarah mentioned she had a single through back that when uh all the way through a\nFrom ... stern and\nEnded in certain cruising conditions

lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last\nSeven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like fix it when you read the articles but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archive work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago when you were first year recap the hoop a project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came\nTo me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business\nAnd you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if we you have Twenty years of police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six\nTo eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Moscow\nIt's California and I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek were the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live miles away who saw one coming into town I started to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans\nAnd I found a diamond unbelievable look an individual name Harvey ... who was\nAssistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd when the Harvey would sit down with a a witness to a robbery and drop the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man his\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept accepted him because he's a ... Native American chief got a law enforcement background so we can kind of smell when it happens and\nI have done this for a long time now together and uh we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of Hooper and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nA field goal in the fourth quarter eventually defeating the Miami Dolphins forty thirty seven in overtime at your high heart radio weekends for each time capsule\nExcuse me I Know you have a nine o'clock so I'll keep it short I'm a business suit in the back of your closet you warming nearly every day before your office went ... casual\nI used to be the c._e._o. of your closet now I'm just out one interns no one ever talked to I always thought you'd circle back with me get granular keep me in the pipeline but not\nNothing don't you were a member of the kitchen presentation you still coffee on me and I still look amazing during the break out talk back human eight so\nI think it's time for me to move on I got a great resume and I absolutely crushed in interviews okay let's make a clean break ship the paradigm the only thing I ask that you think outside the box here and do this\nTake me any good well where I can really make a difference\nYour donations to good will create new jobs training programs an education assistance for people in your community defined your nearest donation center go to goodwill dot org donate stuff create jobs a message from good will and the ad council\nAnd I can't take and then next thing I mean you sound that's been taken to the doctor when I broke my flight for leading me alone when I Want it to be alone and now as a grown up I'm thankful\nFor being able to take care of you my mom for taking media therapies for understanding from time to simply want to be alone rules change without us noticing that's why a A R B gives you the information to provide even better care for your loved one\nIn eight or ... dot org slash caregiving brought to you by a RPI comes when asking your smart speaker for Nebraska\nNews weather in trying to make sure you\nHave a baby [noise]\n\nAbreast of the league and the legend [noise]\n\n\nJak covered with\nSo [noise]\nYou know better not [noise]\n[noise] [noise] you\nWhen\n\nWhen [noise]\nWhen\nThis is coast to coast am with Georgia now [noise]\nOkay so does that mean against being we we were looking for some songs written about big foot and there are several [noise] uh I Would have to\nPut it this way though the definitive big puts song has yet to be written that one by uh burrows Smith was supposedly written by Johnny Cash that's what it says on line I'm Still not sure that that's true\nBut ah it's a interesting tune it's interesting attempt at it anyway we're talking with David polite us\nAbout his new book big wild man and giants archived articles sixty and eighty to Nineteen twenty two there are hundreds of them hundreds of credible stories about a different creatures that look sort of like an animal and look sort of like a man a close up encounters including some famous people\nAnd we're going to hear some of those stories are in a moment we're going to continue our conversation about the DNA evidence that they apply to help to uncover with Melba catch them in just a moment here on coast to coast am [noise]\nIf you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who ... then you should consider\nCardio ... the FDA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone\nAnd it fits in your pocket so you can take an EKG anytime anywhere to order visit cardio dot com K.
