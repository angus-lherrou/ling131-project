is political total war this is not a you know made the best man when this is one man will win and one man will not leave the octagon so to speak and in that kind of political environment you you have to be ready to to go bare knuckle an end in a sense that's really what I've learned from Trump you\nKnow there there have been some things\nThat Trump is Donald Trump is said and I thought oh my gosh that's such a mistake oh my gosh\nTrump if have gone with that that's so that's so foolish of and that's so silly and then within a few and this happens less and less now because I realize we're dealing with with Trump or and then time passes\nAnd I realized wait a second he was right not to apologize for that they would've just mould him like a like a ... of say a flock of per on us but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging per on us or that they they would have torn apart if he had\nAgreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the

[noise]\nAnd um I could hardly see the players when they the map started England played Scotland but I heard the match in my headphones and then suddenly I hear that Gary McAllister who was the the strike her you know the guy who strike who puts in goals most [noise]\nGet the penalty which means that Ninety percent there would score Scotland would score a goal and from the helicopter believe it or not I move the bone away from his foot\nOff the ball down ice cream\nIn the helicopter one two three move and the bold moves away this has been documented by the BBC filmed and if you get on my Web

Scottish\nRight yeah they have they welcomed with open arms again\nOh yes yes yes now listen\nThis this island it's called ... island\nAnd it said to me it's very mysterious and and the ... it's it's

skies a high in the low sixties and uh west northwest when at five Fifteen miles per hour Wednesday mostly sunny a heightened you're sixty Thursday mostly sunny a little breezy in a high of sixty six with ... most\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the sentence and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether Edison ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan Doubleday uh we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe the thoughts are positive I Believe that if\nYou walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this and I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and currents that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to\nArise from circumstances and I've experienced miracles of my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off until I was in my forties and that didn't happen by\nAccident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization was an\nAffirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle has a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nAnd the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a fought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found that people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities that responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes\nThat much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance mentally and and often shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of\nOther ... before you came on and he's he was in Israel and of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter\nIn ... he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him to me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know Edgar Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost that he couldn't find it and he was telling worry about it in out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping\nAnd it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the\nOther part of it the the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing to look for that [laughter] I was just\nAmazing but back to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can go back to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know that'd be too but\nYou know people dabble in the dark side the curse other people they put exes on other people and then a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect\nHowever one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition teaches that the only way that you can project\nA negative spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of science has sort of cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events all the time from across in and finish to to possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select\nAnd you can select events on the right circumstances within exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged\nThought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools\nIn the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who live meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was one habit and George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you are going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what they had and they didn't have a few good songs\nReally did they had some beautiful pop songs and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them\nNot thing don't you remember the ... presentation you still coffee on me and I still look amazing during

I I tend to think there is a very deep rooted tie in here\nYou know there is the question you know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nCyclical research serious experiments that the ESP creek admission eleventh the and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the S P lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways that\nWe receive and get and give information that go beyond the five senses once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind has an existence outside the fence a body and open the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just\nMaterial beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us projects to give us and to me to\nHalf way and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. run the grade ESP researcher found that ESP results like in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject\nSo that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff I Do\nWe've that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals take that list\nPut it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it\nMorning noon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude\nAnd most important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense and they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it and when the results arrive\nExpress things that is a method we can all do it is easy isn't that once you get into it it\nIs easy the the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and has to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a a a a a small number of things that coalesce\nAround one name has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that when you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television narrating and and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics\nIn the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel\nLike I'm an example of the effectiveness of these methods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes\nA gestation period is also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle\nOr the miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the vertical club you didn't have to\nSign your name up anywhere there was no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member of a number of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it on my website my email\nEmail me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you could find it you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card a designating their membership in America club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories it's overwhelming though\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's a part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are fact times George where we get
