[laughter] and I know that\nThat that sounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that place turned out to be here is if the one [noise]\nVegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between\nLas Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state\nWere incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred and so uh I have of course continue now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can uh capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way a very cool that you played a a a group from Ashville North Carolina the\nOr you know Asheville is my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play an Ashville group but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believed coincidences Josh\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense doesn't Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal they should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nIf their goal is to come back here and slave us it might be a better fate for us to commit to global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work like animals\nWe hit these buttons and\nWe just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case so do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made\nAt one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Roswell and um you know the the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against and\nThey're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting\nWith some stuff sadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect ah\nThis could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it

mean they had ... votes in mind that too\nBut I never told anybody this at I was really a lot to say anything that is what I did tell two of my close friends and um I don't let it way than not what I was sure\nThey have the I\nGuess you know up until now I hadn't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the car\nYou know what I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nBut you didn't think it would carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they engage in my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was a ... that's the only time I ever had anything like a safe steroids ghost media all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in more than you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most\nInteresting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks among us right now who where are you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the\nProblem is that we humans\nAre spirits in the material world it's like that song by the police\nAnd so when you are a spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming that the aunt can't see that the aunt is more sensitive to what's happening on on a lower level\nSo anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who pass over\nMy definitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case John and it seems like that's the most likely thing that happened to you\nAny updates with Robert de haunted dull Josh\n[noise] you know Robert at this point lives like a king and and and this is very funny because he still Lorna yeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen\nHim in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there\nThey were taking him out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him and it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck\nStarted hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this call here\n... you know Romney was fighting back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how\nYou have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part\nThanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and almost ten years ago\nAnd to do live reports and to really dig into this and I you may or may not recall George I actually called into the show\nI realized you know live it was just me and Robert and the whole place just the two of us was a creepy yes it is great [laughter]\nGala I mean just anybody who's never seen Robert The dog just go look him up you know on the just type in Robert that all Google and you know you can see he's a creepy looking guy but from the moment I got there I was respectful\nI ask because prevention if you go to my Web site you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robert ... and I said look I'm Joshua pie Warren\nI have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert and I got along very well and uh so I think you should also rest assured George that you played a big role probably\nAnd helping to educate people that there is something bad happens to you if you're disrespectful to the stall and if you're nice to ... then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the Dole was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the dog like in the window we're running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the

F. A. B. [noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Georgian already with you with Joshua ... the war in our final segment next hour we'll talk about haunted World War two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in paranormal investigating what was that one catalysts that got you into it\nMost places have a colder drier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your\nSocks on the carpet and touched the door knob and there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electrodes data charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet\nHas this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that\nThis time of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nJosh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people who've always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nUh especially in Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody is becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar that ah\nI every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent in North Carolina then there are in Scotland\nAnd uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mysteries the ah last colony and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give

actually be close to sixty degrees by the time the sun comes up on Monday jets were showers and storms ramp up during the day with a potential for some heavy rain any flood watch is in effect\nAnd initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I've found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nA and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any ghost stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple go stories with\nTales of sacred in cities and and forty and tails so a hunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and the vents from World war one that overlapped in World War two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on teens as opposed to regular kind\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect\nOf those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower um and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think ghost stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in the history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the the stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories\nIn and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just won a little big corn oh we're accustomed to less than was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was wanted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still\nHang around what what's going on there yeah\nThere are a lot of theories about why battlefields seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ...\nNow on the other hand there there are some of the arrests and also say that you the shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plane to the next that's\nThat's the other theory now there's a whole\nSkeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that because these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so haunted\nNews or a specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\nI think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourist there documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications\nA seemed to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a a father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of French for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy beaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker and when\nThe daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she sold these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe\nTheir uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff uh immediately ... ah recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nBut then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she ... he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences\nIn Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dens battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle of the bulge\nAnd uh he claims to have encountered a lot of weird activity there and he considers that area one of the most haunted places in Europe he also said that ah the concentration camps are extremely haunted but out of honor and respect for those the dead there he\nRefuses to investigate he's just heard a lot of stories\nAnd uh likewise I decided to leave any stories about the concentration camps ... out of my book too\nYeah that's too emotional yeah too much really\nWhat would you say your some of the most dramatic stories that you put it in the ...\n[noise] some of the most dramatic story\nIn every chapter riveting I got to say\nOh I appreciate that the one that moved me the most I found were the stories that happened uh uh in the Pacific theater and again when you're talking about world\nWar two you're talking about a global conflicts so these ghost stories crop up literally everywhere yeah a ... in Okinawa was that was the one story that stood out for me a and there's a story about a group of civilians who are committed suicide a\nAnd mass right after the the American invasion of\nOkinawa and just a little like heaven's gate or something like that\nWell it wasn't exactly like that or the story is uh that the Japanese military knew that Okinawa was kind of the last\nFortress they had a ... in the Pacific if the Americans took over al ... Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring a most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories\nThe civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God\nThe ...\nYou can like you know I was already in the poll I could take care of my bill\nBill Murray also meals I don't know I'm really looking forward to nurse\nWill become like\nOne is sixteen years made the threat of hunger and millions more limit isolation drop off a hot meal and they were not allowed to balance here for meals on wheels by donating your lunch break at American elected to launch dot org ... meals on wheels America and the ad council\nThis week tops you'd be strange\nHere's like you've been watching on TV that's the way the than she is under way of the CBS Drama SEAL Team starring David ... the premiere episode fracture is it number five next number four in the printed done the Tucker clan in Modern Family now in its tend to see that and\nIt's the Philadelphia Story on the latest episode of NBC's this is ads which comes in third place\nThen number two what marriage gray and team are faced with life and death decisions daily on Grey's Anatomy and finally it's applied for humanity salvation on American horror story apocalypse the could it be Satan episode at your number one TV screen\nThat certainly top GB stream our radio\nPoppy seeds better from Bucky collie period and it's even better out of a news radio eleven ten K. a baby buggies coffee mug the visit ... dot com today and registered to win one on the conduct\nPage what can your smart speaker opened up a newsletter and try and make sure you please say play K.

interested in history go there uh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave\n'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the stories that\nHave been told about that a famous area are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left his watch on the USS Arizona [noise] ah just briefly and then\nDuring that time where he left the ship it was attacked and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor\nStanding at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour or so that goes story has been told a quite a bit um [noise] excuse me ...\nThere's also a story of a level of one lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces\nIn them into the picture very in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and goes stories at places like the show field barracks\nAnd ... areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular and heck I'm a there was a headquarters building that supposedly\nIt is dramatic Matthew swing with us his latest book haunted World War two where do you get the book Matthew\nYou can get it at Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com go to your um a local bookstore and see if they have it in if they don't shake 'em down and try to get it in for me I'd appreciate it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want to just I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about uh after World War two if you had these battleships you had ... ah aircraft carriers and\nThey were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap it uh luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and\nAnd some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nUh there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who are wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina\nI worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those ah and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved him and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\nYeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated\nEven some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies\nJust seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so crime and\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew ... we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your a haunted rock

lot\nSo I go into a ah some of these stories with really preconceived notions and then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I I Try to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme about haunted rock and roll is that I'm really when I started writing hunter rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times uh\nAnd uh you know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the Cold War attracted to it\nBut after writing of the country book and then revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... uh I came away with is the thought that\nMusic is really just to consciousness raising toll ah it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of\nA historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the the listener and and the musician\nThat I think makes either people more open to things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of of visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of this book in my opinion\nIs that the at least the history has to live on that to me seems to be the main message whether it's go slower ghost stories that something important happened in something needs to be preserved I that's kind of my own personal philosophy of it\nWe have Eric in Illinois Welcome to the show Hi Eric Europe with us\nGo to her mind control guy has every\nEverybody's fine he's a regular
