... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human humans\nThey want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energy if they generate hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra system deals with the idea of that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do I\nWould not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent\nFreeze say sharman priest exorcist\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared and these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyways it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you\nKnow sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the whole the sense of family that's having a problem\nBecause of emotional energy and are living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's\nBest to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out once and I then I teach people how to maintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistant just about every religion but the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody\nSo I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs

or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away\nEspecially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone or you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I guess that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained\nBecause they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy you don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them are on negative spirit and so\nYou know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helped you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients\nThat I've helped or the last almost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do\nAnd I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already by different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around six people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around\nReally on a business or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of it\nNegative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments and they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools people go to school I went to this this is the same\nSchool both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful but I mean think of the moon energy just laid it\nAnd so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and\nThe body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it\nI teach people how to do that you know and and so sometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good because it just for you know most all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about\nTurmeric and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues I didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that what happened after ... board followed me as it said it would and\nI've lost two families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated\nMan and I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried cleansing my house with stage and everything else\nUm I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean and I'm I'm not getting anywhere you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nOh definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loosen up emotional energy it loses out negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sends cope whole there's many substances that work very very well loosening up\nEnergy is kind of like spring something on the wall to get something off of it\nBut it doesn't alone get rid of the home\nSee that's the problem is is that same age will release it\nYou know out into the atmosphere but it will not moving from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because essentially what I think it's going on here to Jay is you've you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nFrankenstein it's all of these things you know I recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things\nYou know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work and to some extent\nBut emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the Bruins pushing it all the dust into the

personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica fault I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a war time battle field situation\nAnd you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are messages through our rules on the other side of emotional energy\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm listener negative\nVery negative what we might call hell and in essentially that is very connected to the physical realm I think of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon

off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to SERE steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for spirits out there that actually\nAre very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them my job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields\nI don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window\nI just don't have the time I have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's possessed or anything we just have negative energy issues\nAnd also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack\nBut not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or pub the pub whatever\nAnd getting them out of their fast and making it work so the family or the individual the safe this is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nYou every are you glad you have this ability this ability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you please\n... you can find everything

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and once in a looser tree but afterwards I woke up right after and sure enough that was only a dream\nBut what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has been consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with the with the way he can dream\nSure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on the um\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ...

tell me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very ...\nBush will of course there's a broad range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nA while what why are they here and in in what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity and people actually blame the watchers for humanity's hills\nAnd that's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that\nThey were here they came from the heavenly realm from the rump called sigh on according to the Bible the location of God's throne\nThey're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity of teaching about\nHow humans can transform into angels and make the journey from the earthly round to the heavenly realm of sigh on\nIt it seems that that what's happened in the intervening centuries and by the way it was the watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis and then it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this rise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic\nMaterial developed by the ... the idea\nOf scenes apocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being angelic being maybe even an extraterrestrial in some people's view\nWho delivers knowledge about another supernatural world and this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers\nAnd the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary between flash and light between spirit and flash\nNow these scenes did they not right to did see squirrels as well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there's no question that that after the destruction

was who established the priesthood which Jesus was a member\nOf the other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ and they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of the devil onto your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts we can actually become angels\nAnd it's an amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from uh several years ago these are the\nOrder of angels and they watch\nGuard God's throne and in fact during the ... shots it was a belief was developed a sheriff and we're actually humans\nWho
