should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers that can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap\nI early on you know you're you're actually much more solution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that we don't have\nEnough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum that's what they will do\nRight so it's not this isn't oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side if you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just try to sneak in the United states free and clear or\nIf you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum defensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song can you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor and they're not going to deport you for that until you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need a much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these\n... properly they're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against him they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo but are are in your ear at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a\nA a set up at the border where was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so they're tricky right down there and\nYou know you get justice dispensed right away you get your fine are you going to jail or whatever\nSo it it sort of like that at the border would be what would you could do ... or when you're\nYou're on the right track my friend Bryan writes box

the left is also very tenacious so it was quiet it I can tell a lot of you that does all this that it was quite a thing\nIt was quite a thing that uh that happens or by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young Turks maybe there tomorrow and while I'm not planning to be in any way hum disrespect for aggressive ah I have a feeling we will disagree profusely on some issues I have a feeling that could very well happen so\nWe will see a Josh book I Want to thank you for writing my day after long stressful day it's nice to listen in on the drive home you're accurate depiction of

the past and the president and the future all exists in the infinite realm our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you were seeing everything that is how do you know that\nWould question the question\nAnd often that stop someone because one can take a book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that

Y. indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the art cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a shape of rock dust in ice left over from our solar system creation and then from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to adopt the astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and us go much further\nStarting where the hyper Belden and extend for three point to light years from earth and theoretical shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic at ... dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine when indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident that huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big ... orbits all the way to the word cloud\nForgot your brown simply called the planet nine because he's the driver that got quite a knock down to a dwarf planet after he had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades it was twenty three and protests are brown that year discovered it another\nOr planet he called error out in the hype rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto so it was professor brown who argued that Pluto should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted\nIn the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed prevent their brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the cat and super observatories in Hawaii define planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote tail like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this ... save planet nine or planted act that he uh is\nStill trying to mine and he told me that he\nIs planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to actually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculation place on the body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than map June a good way out there but they have ... narrow down the focus so yeah there were only going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date when you start the very first that's not very far away\nWhat frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with a big ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet now and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see\nOnce we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing another direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [noise] this is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where\nMight just have come from why is this massive\nObject all the way out the edge of the type about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or not you were inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter\nSaturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition is all of this is just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it would be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold have any close up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely president\nExactly how far from earth to where you think there is no object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and your cloud\nWe didn't do that and I think that's that's the great things that people don't necessarily always know about it since the orchestra is it's an incredibly versatile organism\nThere's sometimes we have the orchestra doing for different programs in a week and we'll be\nEducation program where our primary audience is early elementary school kids in the same week doing a program working with our Hispanic community to celebrate Hispanic heritage month at the same time rehearsing for the opera which is the next week and doing a symphony rocks show all in the same seven days and that I think is is the gift\nThat are in the ... can bring to a community the numbers are quite staggering actually so when you think about the um Hudson's bay and it's like it's over a hundred and twenty thousand people every year and of course a number of those folks are in our concert hall but I Would say over thirty percent or not and we've got twenty five thousand\nOf our area students to participate in education programs all the way from a mission imagination program is the first introduction to our\nPre school and early elementary kids to a partnership with Carnegie Hall in New York um which allows kids to study music with recorders remember recording yeah fluke\nI Love Lincoln because the teachers implement this curriculum in their classroom such a big responsibility for them but then the combination event as the kids come to the concert home with their recorders\nAnd they all play with the same level and kept the great

showing to do is have you worked on the ... the report about what we can expect say in North America\nIn just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those best estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding whole now to an industry that we thought had ended that we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts\nOf greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on\nMy guess is that the politicians assume that\nThe problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem I ... or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes in houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast right on the Alaska\nDue to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got\n... of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees and that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere\nWhere there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of

my office where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of the computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just to three weeks ago in October third I was doing update on tree category the first had to do with the very distressing subject of half Gatsby had a cat\nAround the world a lot less weird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with\nAnnouncing that it was closing down its investigations\nAfter three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspot solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an air force base\nAt the down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then third update had evolved from my asking my or fires YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth anyone had young childhood memories of flooding out of body\nTypically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone that's before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan\nSaw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream [noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sat me that was slowed down it was weird ah\nAnd the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years at first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a come like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you\nCan see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked that second week I asked my er files YouTube channel audience\nIf anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office\nAnd uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky fog\nIs it like act applies them I Do not know this is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mention any of this parent to

I was mowing the lawn\nSure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature so at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the covers of them myself and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with new stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again and\nThrough the window I can see this misty gray\nBall drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen with fascination of I didn't know what the bank and then as it reached my forehead\nI could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia and they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions\nThey were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nAnd you

these high regret but they had the same texture of the fall and good\nWould shadow in life\nBut they were living on us at the same time and they would just blow by me but kind of leave at the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything\nThat was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was just super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given

see later on in the site in a flashing bright red light\nOn leave a dorsal surface of the object very interesting sighting after the first object Esau moved to the east towards Winston Salem
