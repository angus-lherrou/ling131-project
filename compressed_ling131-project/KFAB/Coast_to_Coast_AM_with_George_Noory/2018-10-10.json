it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring that expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get do you go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now\nWhat is Google Plus from still ...\nIs a Google a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWhy it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy\nHer latest book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on but sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell I'll say right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical vulnerability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that a lot of that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but by the it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion the sun setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first place\nUm and ah it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've and using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial versions of Google Plus\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head\nUsing us that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing

... at the end at the time\nThat it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them

great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before ... the pre cognition tell the ... cycle couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nAbsolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\n[noise] now let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she came she came out with some astounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah it's a lot but he's a very important phenomenon it's it's mind my communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I exam each of these phenomenon is that I reason that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like to laugh at the end the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo ... to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combine the results\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm\nDoctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to\nStatistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds of that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one\nAnd intellect at the we have six sigma results so the ... experiment study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very you know very relaxing state listening to relaxing music\nThere's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room Jane is given a picture by the experiment yours and the experimenter say Jane I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent\nThe classic study uses random number generators these are machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion\nSo again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have\nFifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time what the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once in a zero again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in ... people have that ability going up\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators were set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers\nAnd what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround events that we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant trick basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to use a ... keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic\nBut the the ... believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of\nSpoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator works actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real\nIncluding um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller then spoons\nSo there are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal her very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier there's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons ending\nWithin the context of remote viewing bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching him closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that\nStudies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that town totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people

overnight hours cloud will stay with us as temperatures fall off into the mid forties by Wednesday morning slowly decreasing plowed through the day on Wednesday after a little bit of mourning the result we should get some afternoon sunshine hides in the upper forties and North West winds Augusta thirty miles per hour with them as most accurate\nIt was later found to be the defender later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody\nIs literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing him he's dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body\nIntel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson is one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark ... six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that the room\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit ... with this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary\nA perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientists you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot damage\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational eighth year than I materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and he's in ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be\nSeeing you ... you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically I liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about side medications explains psychiatric medications medications\nFor either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter]\n... chemically the brain and their work they do affect chemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical leave the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches\nGoing back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind and that's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious as the mines does thing that show it here's my question for you it doesn't it showed that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident\nAnd then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation what I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so\nIt's a simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [laughter]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up a very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire\nSo I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen ... what do you think mark of reincarnation well I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about\nStudies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes verified by medical records by the use the professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another offensively\nWe have Monique in someone California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi

had told me I'm In the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe a Bible or some religions it's the body and mind here at all\nAnd so I kind of think that what you're saying is differentiating\nBetween the spirit or the other person is is it's outside and the spirit inside her or either or but um I I kind of think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nTV

clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things steam and just said we're on our way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institutions even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well\nWe haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field of physics that has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nThat there are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do psychic ... this is open me out completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism\nWhich if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves that to me that this this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nOr I my friend mark thank you again one more time you bought your Web site

question see you know there are many people that welcome her with open arms but let's just say the town Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seemed to\nBe at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft\nAnd um so basically she did you know she really changed the\nWhole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of these and then it you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about we back to your family you said this ability what year are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought the girls insane [laughter]\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I mean it was normal I did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh he has some holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in her sixties she finally told me that she is you know what Marlene this has been\nFrom my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and reading to them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\nSo would\nYou say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her um\nBut my great grand right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people so I heard that\nYou know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard\nTo know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever pass dome stories from one to the others that you could carry through\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe maybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she had a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true so she was very unique that what she said\nSo that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England new goes project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\nA well rounded doing much better than me to tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special courts are classics\nYou talk to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he started cable program and during that cable program he didn't have to do it on something so he chose you know doing on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to [noise]\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house or just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\n[laughter] I'll show [laughter] sure his records I guess\n[laughter] um you know\nAs as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well isn't good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat do you conclude about what this may be or make a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think there are\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been you know if I Do reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed\nOver that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass 'em but then you know you called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items and being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them\nUm we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door to door closed in her\nApartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs on you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven and she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the plane itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent knife\nUm doesn't mean that you're going to have a spirit that's a hundred percent you know wonderful and nice\nMuch not all fun and games\nI don't know I mean think about it you have someone who is [noise] let's say a not a very evil person what if you have a person like a murderer that's in prison and they pass do they immediately growing I mean it's it's you know there's just a\nLot of things can be aware of um when people go out and investigate and realizing that it's it's not all just fluffy bunny\nHave you concluded marine the the the reserve hell but hell does exist\nYou know I personally don't believe I mean I was brought up Catholic um sometimes I Believe if there is a hell in the afterlife it's because we created ourselves um I don't believe that you know there is necessarily a hell no\nInteresting no more drugs you why do you keep investigating\nI don't I I investigate\nBecause I don't feel I can stop sometimes you know I over the years um I've\nYou know you're like addicted to it\nMm no not addicted to it but to me when I'm\nYou know investigating a lotta times I'll use energy and expend energy when I'm doing that\nUm and if I don't I feel like sometimes if I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing my life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right I'm like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical work I Do a lot of work on computers\nUm and occasionally when I Would go through those fans of time and not actually use that energy I Would tend to uh fly a lot of my electronics\nAre from ... to forward to your book more ghost chronicles of course is the author of the world's most places what a great investigator she is

Ron is the founder and lead investigator of the New England ghost project with a degree in environmental science now he was\nA skeptic however a near death experience changed all that for him no

hosts a weekly Internet radio show on\nToggle net dot com and also has co written books with Maureen\nThe ones I've told him told you about more ghost chronicles and ghost a day welcome Ron good to talk with you it morning looking\nForward to this ah tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because I had cut my fingers are on a table sorry which\nYeah you know anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time\nSo they can wrap them nice and and kept me and emerged to convey a specialist at six and a half hours later they put them all back together and ah you know it was fine but during the night um I got that came up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine\nShe called in for a CAT scan actually had to bring the the woman in the hospital was nobody like at that time and they realized they had a blue Murray embolism\nShe was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's\nIt's one that's left an impression with us I\nThink so what kind of equipment do you bring with you\nOr it varies on on on particular case uh\nThe you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as location than the more people but more of a piece of equipment or\nThe smaller case the lesser amount but you always want to um you know tried to bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance\nIf you have reports of a ... be unseen you might bring more video equipment or thermal or I or whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound the ... something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies appointing we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nThat I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization go visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations\nProbably four times um but the interesting part about it a judges that they weren't really well I was ghost times in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah I work with a a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public go sons and that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his 'cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House so we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this um\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and say he's windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and those who want to do it in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them I'm doing my ... year old and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the ... the a side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself ... she came and they didn't want her to miss anything so I I stopped and waited for a night I saw her continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the the rock out there and there was another one by the ... inches of snow this there's nobody out there\nBut yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in and yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat said vocation is where the coast got because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reports and women walking on the wall and\nThat same location so that was kind of intriguing um perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public goes on ah\nWhat Iowa lighthouse in that pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep U.S House it was on\nA renovation at that time we were sitting on a picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen look towards the kitchen they search dog all across the or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no it\nWas a ... so I jumped up and meal you're in the kitchen\nAnd window on the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says why would you see that's just that's our dog she says to describe it sure absolutely yeah SARS clear as day and I describe that she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would die lighthouse keepers afterward took care of them until the dog eventually died and I don't she says the dog you describe much matches\nBecause she has a dog that that of that dog and I did see a picture that looked like it but can I say that was like no\nBut so I mean is two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nAnd it's still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of

you know they're not going to release his parents and you know those are things you hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know those parents have been there long before we have um and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that goes out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know

my mentor when I first went in to go start thing I went on the Web site on the Web which was new and that was the largest site on there it was goes village so that's a since then we've become really good for us\nThis technology continue to make ghost haunting easier\nUh probably easier but not better not better quicker there's ... there's a lot of\nUm\nThings out there are some of them are really junk science but a\n... year I don't know I mean spirited around for you know hundreds and hundreds of years and ah they didn't have a lot of technical stuff back then yet people still hate experiences though had great experiences and seeing them and everything else I Know you know we need to\n... you know it reminds me of you know all the physical meaning ship stuff the review boards and those were those were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people wanted to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic devices doing this there are trying to get the ghost tons of deal directly with her and\nNot have to go to a meeting or not have to you know almost on demand type of thing but it's yeah I mean there are there are some\nUm\nBetter pieces of equipment up there and there are some that are of course but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good eye our camera or a good record\nAnd marine how 'bout you will technology or change things\nAre you know I honestly don't think the technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human beings you know and then what we can sense ourselves on and we may be getting close with some areas that they're you know they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator anytime soon [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nIts place it's a temporal things versus the and the thing so I mean that's just going on doing their time basically but that's I mean that's the only one theory there are many three shifts the tragedy thing is one I always heard about in\nGettysburg was always supposed to be the most part it then that's why it's the most thing but there are there are battles I mean Nagasaki and you I mean thousands of people will tell like that why are we seeing like all those goes from running around so there's got to be certain aspects of that we were unaware of have yet to\nDetermine and uh and and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly\nFor sure we have out there is and that's all it is\nAre there any friendly ghosts like Casper or are they all kinds of evil\n[laughter] well well yeah I mean what's what's the guardian angel what's a a you know spirit guide on right now the ghost to maybe\nI guess it depends on what the definition of the ghost might be\nAnd if somebody sees their dead grandmother at the side of the bed is that a ghost or is that the some kind of entity your spirit or or one of his name\nThe number one I always say that number one citing is is what I Believe is a messenger goes that's somebody who is just passed away and they they either come back to see how you're doing them no outlet you know that there are okay I mean it happened to my mom my mom didn't believe in goes or anything my dad died at a\nCompany that family cookout never got to say goodbye that\nNight uh she was in bed she swears he came in fully dressed in a suit she scared the crap and she screamed and he disappeared but there are countless examples of that uh throughout history\nIt's got a shade in in billings Montana first time caller squeeze shaded and go ahead and she didn't\nGo and George great thank you a\nQuestion of what you're talking about spirit guide a little bit and it really piqued my interest in that night my interest is once again I'm actually had a question for Maureen sure\nUm I've had numerous people throughout my life come up to me and told me there's something bold and been what and they can never give me a straight answer I've always been curious as to what it is\nAnd have you have you felt that you had something following you oh my entire life you have\nFrom my from my early childhood I felt there is something following me or how to experience when I was about seven years old my backyard my parents were both inside the house and I came in screaming because some some things that my name into my ear and it made my ear vibrate\nBox that my ... now have you ever you sell voice\nHave you felt threatened or do you feel secure with whatever entity is doing this\nYou know it's kind of a car and I feel here and then there are times when I feel like it I don't ever feel like it's trying to harm me but I Do feel like there's certain people in my life that it goes into effect in wave\nAnd interesting what let me tell you in the in the short time we have left my experience is\nThat if these entities aren't hurting you uh the the I don't think you have much to worry about Maureen we've only got about thirty seconds left would you agree with that if he's not being heard that the these entities aren't out to really hurt him\nAbsolutely and I was gonna say George you get a great job because that was the same thing I Would ask because typically I don't think it's a who I mean what something is following I think that if someone\nUm and I think it's more of a relative it's like a guardian angel that's looking over you know maybe there will be watching out for you and sometimes not as gentle when they speak with you but I don't think they're there to harm you\nAll right both of you thank you so much for being on the program the name of the book is called more goes chronicles it's really a great read if you're into ghost stories in the supernatural

the Web to killing\nGoogle has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring

ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus from silver plus is is\nA Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people\nCrazy her latest book so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime\nEverybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you gotta have the as you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on but sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell I'll say right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during a if I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical vulnerability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that all of that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they cut us out on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first\nPlace um and ah it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who have\nBeen using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things and I mentioned that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month per per head\nUsing us that's going to

thinking\nMark ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the ... cycle ... he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research the new\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she came she came out with some ... things but what did you find\nIt yeah it's a lot but he's a very important phenomenon it's it's mind my communication and just taking a quick step back\nThe reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I reason that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain\nThat perspective cannot account for things like till after the and the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo well apathy [noise] to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combine the result\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rating\nWho just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to\nStatistical odds against chance when you get a stick stick my resolve the odds of it that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one\nAnd in telepathy we have six sigma results so they can't solve experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to
