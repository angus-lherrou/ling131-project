I mean who is out there saying well\nOkay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause they they ah let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities and then\nThe the um [noise] um the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to\nSelling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation now if I could make it easy for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age she calls herself for Cuban she's young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially is the parents of Gen Z\nA but it ... what we're watching is is is a at a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and if you look at you you know people say well they they ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and he said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find is just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated as as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWell listen here's here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a a liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo all in all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does we not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean ... unless I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter suck that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's\nMore information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing can we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't you get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad to have you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\nYou know people ...

Tuesday Morning mostly ... guys again Tuesday slight chance of showers south but the majority of us Stay dry fifty seven for the high north northwest when ten to twenty miles per hour fifty eight and partly cloudy a Halloween looks absolutely perfect to the trick or treaters some odd most accurate forecast\nAre and the the the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's going to happen or will it cooked himself because they're going to have a sexually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've got to support that can support themselves and now that they they have a whole new crop of of the kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nNow what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try and would they do something desperate\nYeah ... ... whenever a country gets in trouble I'm with\nA their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nIt on the go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same things happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response so two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war\nUm he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked us in the I I Can't do that as a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman bird I wanted to see two things to you\nFirst of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the\nPorn star because she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he could run and possibly when\nUm the presidential nomination for the Democrats um this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys said and all the yeah\nWas temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or try to and bring down this man but more importantly that man has kids\nEspecially a little one still at home I got in that little one but a young one include and his wife and we had a president did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember Trump\nIt's reactionary he doesn't start fights\nYou look at everything from his campaign going forward he is reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature of the second thing I disagree that is sad is that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business and it should be run like a business I have started to successful businesses myself this is men and women don't have time for nonsense\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have a meeting to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that\nWe don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy doesn't win more diplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he's a no nonsense visits\nMatch anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had\nThe audacity to get back up yet I'm no wars\nI thought I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and\nShe doesn't care if people call him a racist because God Knows what scientists hearts and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about just\nDiplomacy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nTurned let's get as good as common today not in your comments are warranted obviously in your number right to say these things would you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the D.C ...\nThe biggest enemy to any country uh in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilets I'm going to pay the fair market value or even tried to get it the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but I Would also say that that our country is a republic with a constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat well but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting\nAnd stuff like that but if he let them about what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I I don't know I I think what he has done his dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she\nGot it and I mean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nYou know yeah uh and you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you hire yourself in it and then just move on and say you know folks I already said that I'm done with it and and that like that\nIt exactly George C ... and I I respect the the um the criticism I really do of of ... my comment because when I stray outside of demography\nMy position on ... the ... and my ability to forecast what's next based on demography is based on a ... a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot view\nWhen they you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel\nRight now are getting yeah kind of ... what's what's going to happen going forward\n... ... is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized just like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people and a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not\nOffer the the a position of of either of those too so\nUh well what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so my my comment today and it would be thank you for your position if you forgot yelling at me [laughter]\nLet's go to zero in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nKen two

can they do in the same thing is China are they in a different position\nThey aren't there aren't really in an entirely different position and and but they have their own problem there about one point four billion people in fact we're not really even sure how many people are in India but we we ah my best guess is there's more people in India that there are in China\nBut they have about a two and a half trillion dollar GDP and then went ... and ... may sound like a lot but when you compare that to the United states with twenty trillion GDP there's really no comparison so it it's it's not India is not enough uncovering the\nBiggest problem that India has is wealth distribution they literally have haves and have nots and there's no\nOne in between and they they don't seem to be able to get a handle on that\nWhen when you had the haves and have nots are you creating civil unrest and everything else\nYeah you would think that but they're kind of a passive people but I you know I I don't know ... you would you would think that there would be kind of an unrest ah because they're poor people are really poor and the rich people really rich\nNext dumped between let's go to Josh in Toronto, Canada hey Josh thanks for calling go ahead\nGet evening gentlemen I'm doing great thank you good I'm a longtime listener love your show George here it every night even from our belt they\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect in marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military\nAnd the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another means you're more breaking oh\nNo I just I\nJust don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America\nOr we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil we got water\nYeah we've got water we've got fracking where we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nI Am one who's always missiles guinea [laughter] yeah\nYeah but I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wacko is like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I said I said what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise]\nDo you know that the south is not having children there for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population\nImpossible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north and the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level\nFertility Michael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi ah George and higher against um Hi my\nQuestion is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the northeast into like down south and at West because like Florida is now the third most populous state\nOut raking New York state and also a scenic says become the largest city out raking or Philadelphia\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shift ahead we cover every single state\nIf you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada or a [noise] Arizona and New Mexico uh the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate bite in Florida now\nAnd just sit on it\nYeah instead of ... the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be if you're not going to ask what is it ... when will begin to\nSoften and I told her I said listen it hasn't started\nIf you're a woman does it's going to be a huge\n... it's going to be off the charts and what's the same thing is happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nWhat our Vegas is not a good market huge\nOff the charts huge can't believe it I it it's a for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of jobs uh uh I go there all the time my brother has a

Glad to be here today to share more about it schoolers are focused in agriculture commodities oh we have annual sales of about four point five billion were very decentralized or global company but most of our operations are in North America\nThe U.S Canada and Mexico so many of the products that we handle need to get to the global marketplace so a lot of products originated in North America and then shipped public our culture in the company is phenomenal a big belief insurance success of the company was employees there\nBut also big believe in giving back in the communities where employees work and live we have a consistently put profits aside each year to the score foundation were then we can support those in need we have consistently done that in our boys are very thoughtful as well

great people\nAre great people who really care genuinely care and get involved and help out those in need in our community so many of our school employees do that I Would give a lot of credit to our modern day founder marshal bass a who believes and first of all give me back to the employees those who have made the company successful\nAs you do that kind of that culture that is so strong spreads

skies stick with us overnight down to forty eight for the low by Tuesday Morning mostly cloudy skies again Tuesday slight chance of showers south but the majority of us Stay dry fifty seven for the high north North West wing tend to twenty miles per hour fifty eight and partly cloudy on Halloween looks absolutely perfect\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think\nHe's just committed academic suicide [laughter]\nYou know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the\nSeal of the paranormal they and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had\nThe in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist historian\nA but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance to uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rating who's\nThe chief scientist ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there is only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics\nSo that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in in our colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's due to all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly\nA supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast he was out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find another traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I've just that ah it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once more people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's gonna spread a lot faster\nWell with Bruce olive sold ... latest book is called timeless paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues\nIn cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in who tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things\nUh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know\nRegardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this was the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the point at which to do this\nFirst one did you have is you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I was in a\nWeird traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this\nFever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little map and was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBut the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep I thought I was\nGoing to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen and ah it I felt like it it it was an end jelly presents\nIt it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine\nAnd and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first ... experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in an endless was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and\nAnd and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nWhere does science fitted to this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're\nIn academia um yeah we were just science that\nWell I I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked the awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean raven who are just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things in from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've

kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and\nUm it it it was kind of\nComforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but\nVery bizarre it would be weird when it yeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is\nAnd I wasn't quite sure at that time I I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just this check everybody out and\nSee what see who's there very curious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it isn't offered at at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approach them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they\n... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptic\nBut when you went through that red light and you made it through a lives loser reason you're still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what the this vision I had two years ago my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to\nSupport people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out you know and and are you know very chronically under funded because there's you know there's that it's difficult for them to get funding\nAnd I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out how this this spiritual world works and it and it gives great

that\nSo I yeah I use that and that but it and speaking about health I think that's a that's a good topic ah that that's one of the questions that I asked my spirit friends uh I said well what happens to the bad people are they they're in the spirit world with you and\nAnd ah they the the answer that I got a was kind of interesting it was well there there are these demonic elements in in the spirit world but they're not necessarily in the same\nI I actually I Would start with that analysis in about sixth grade that when our around twelve I started the stairs and the first one I saw\nAnd and I do have a question trade barriers and that real quick the first one I saw I Will never forget it was completely unexpected\nAnd within a doorway when I was getting ready for school\nIt was a cat it was actually half of a cat in the ... cat drag self across the doorway what was the other half\n... uh well here's what I don't know but it was ... ... we're going re\nFire out in front of the light and dragging it huh\nAnd it was clear as day and I feel any after that\nI actually contacted one who am I had a name for real weird name I wasn't going to say it on the air but I Will quote quote down\nAnd I actually named the cats after ... later but I saw these every day and night even which show my friend and once at the YMCA and St Louis I Want to tell you that George\nI don't know if you remember the YMCA\nWhen I when I went in that way back then there was a stairway that was all dark and I shut the door and had all these kids sit on the stairs and I asked is that spirit to show it so it was it was like it's big\nGo that appeared right like on a movie screen or ...\nYeah so I've seen many I I once I had a girl I took her and it's always better when it's dark I took her in a closet

psychic I've been told I Am a medium but when I was about Nineteen I caught myself off from that because I didn't want to deal with any real negative energy [laughter] so I feel\nLike I'm not using my

mowed the connection I always say something like\nI'm opening up by I use the star trek thing I'm opening up a all hailing frequencies to all good and kind spirits\nAnd with my spirit guides also helped me there are also called gatekeepers to protect to protect me from any negative energy so you have to say that right up front that ... to it it pretty much bumps them out right away or we do
