colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser\nJohn Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ask for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only built but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine that has um you know\nNot met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because there's a concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and to Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world\nThat I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with a China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok a chain exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nSoldiers thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off\nThe east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states now practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Germany a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated\nSome might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\n\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they consider a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nIt's the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination\nOf the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAnd they do have them the main through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the oven guard a twenty time speed of found\nA nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initial\nTrust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China [noise]\nHow much has the narrative of Russian collusion\nHandcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps smoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this\nThis Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nIn Nineteen eighty ones tattoo he was actually recorded in late January or February of Nineteen Seventy five during the black and blue sessions you may recall the black and blue album that was the first\nIn which Iran would appeared and I may be mistaken but I think I hear Billy pressing on electric piano there and a peek towns on backing vocals [noise]\nAll right uh a newscast an

Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given their provocations\nBut also a military capability which they're not shy to exercise around the globe I'm very you know the chief of naval operations animal rich\nOr have said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with third one or the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and\nA diesel powered submarine that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic for the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting enough militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of fiber as we know all about the allegations and justifiably are the sanctions put in place because with their interference in the twenty sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen Mitt terms we arrested\nA someone of course was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose from there you know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing\nBack you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that I gave them if there's you know some given some take but maybe a if not uh\nSpring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you join up with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I ... to the Internet and what can be used in what can be so now they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you\nAbout Saudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might mean there is there or dominoes at play here obviously and wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states with the Trump

like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered or had heated\nBattles with them a there have been some near collisions and the south China Sea was Chinese vessels how do you see this\nOr what is the the danger of this\nBreaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then time scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick Richard you know we had\nOne here recently with the U.S has a\nDecatur a destroyer\nOr in the grave in ... in the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of bi fifty to set it flew over the\nContested area and the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and [noise]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warship but also for the jet fighters and their bombers of the practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos from their six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nNext door to them it's really in the middle of a sea but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to Ford station armored brigades are so\nThat they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did a in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've killed them\nUm and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of that even\nThough we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario uh in in in that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into says ... thirty eight that we're really talking uh the the dog and mad dog a\nAnd that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a a general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and\nEstablish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you\nKnow the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute\nThat some of these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh\nEven though there are some friction there that they are working together uh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nAnd the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so\nA lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou making her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians are they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ...\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having nuclear capability and I think that's where the air to one wants\nTo all suddenly plenty to rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nOr so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour uh because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to assist\nDegree this belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and military exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging\nA so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing turkey into our secrets into our\nSystems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea either\nNow far from for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by\nA given that so much of the narrative of the show the murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the\nUnited States and uh there's there

Bush draw rock a runner and look\nThe fact that we will now you're ... you're equal but we weren't perpetrate evil around the world where the\nWeapons of destruction everywhere even scarier or or or not did not do one you're going to target people year was ... ... ... ...\n[noise] yeah well I sort of question there Richard ... it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly where they killed millions a hundred\nMile in China where they kill millions\nA and their foreign policy where they\nProvoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support uh yeah we do sell weapons her defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year we we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder is is evil or certainly in my perspective and I you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and look what they want today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization as you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept up the street in the middle of the night and executed\nUh for for no reason in most places in the world\nA and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd the western China Today and that's a un report or somebody look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong we've acknowledge that we do bad things but\nThe rest of the world you know I I have I've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places a and yet you know it's always wonderful\nTo come back home to the United states are where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid as Richard pointed out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had 'em for families being carted away and yet uh unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGot to jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this\nAlliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War thank you so much Bob here's the kinks time song taking us into

very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that\nUs national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly uh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ask for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only built but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that wave tractor cruise missile we call the nine and seven to nine or that has um you know\nNot met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty two new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because there's a concern to solve it you know that is cutting back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons\nAnd to Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly headed

Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a
