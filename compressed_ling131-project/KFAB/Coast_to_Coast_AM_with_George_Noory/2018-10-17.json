the CD with the ... inspired the title between light in shadow on the ... records and his latest as his book called rod Serling his life work and imagination and Nicholas I got to tell you I'm looking forward to this\nFight to judge I thank you very much for having me in a thank you for that very nice in the introduction\nRod Serling was an absolute genius was any\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it and not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again a he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great grapes or shows for for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends marches decree I wrote a book about the twilight zone in his subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if you did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's certainly\nDictated most of his scripts and and honestly I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly was a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nSo let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could\nAnd he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper if that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was assigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne\nAnd he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's got 'em for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them and did he get that from his combat\nOh ... ... as it's yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the toilets on so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his\nMakeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually set in lady um during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age and television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writers or was it was it was this fast you know I Would say vast wasteland it was a vast medium that was just\nDevoid of talent at the time and ... you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff out and stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nAround the world saying the move was a drop of megalomaniac and touch of generosity I tuned users complained that the eleventh songs that they've added to their music library without permission and that it was not

I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man your iPad [laughter]\nYour voice has not changed all that much really really still waiting for puberty the strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and that I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd when you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did is you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise]\nYeah and he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer book out and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could uh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to him about what was coming up in the next episode or so usually one and executive producer or creator comes onto was said you know but it gets a little\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is they launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how\nYou know how classic these shows are they can be reenter reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod Serling one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling [noise] ah so he did get coal credit but ever since the\nMovie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery or twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift [laughter] she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also a very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nOr documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like\nThat now the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays with thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes\nYou know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction and fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will\nYou know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know we live as youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic\nA man is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know the that's\nThe [laughter] ever [laughter] and then just so many good the what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started in that and he started the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got you're kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nFor the next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next
