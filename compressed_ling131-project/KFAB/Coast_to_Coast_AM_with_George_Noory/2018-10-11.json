women in my life who have the men in their lives around them and I've said this is Molly before she she's never safer than when she's around me because I Would risk my life to protect her nuts and I think that as my obligation as a man that is somebody who\nTries to uphold some standards of of honor for himself or I Would you know if there were a threat\nTo our physical safety I Would act\nOr whatever way that I could whatever the costs may be so I and I think that often gets less that are left out of the discussion and a lot of I Know the guys listening to this program I now know exactly what I'm Talking about\nThat the women in your life not just your wife or your girlfriend or but you know the women in your life mom's friends colleagues sisters are are never as safe as when they are in your vicinity because your honor as a man is at stake the moment that any of them are under threat\nSo I just you know just trying to give the full context to this trying to make sure that we approached this discussion from all sides page writes I now have a Fifteen year old daughter named Reagan Cheney listening to your podcast as well\nShe's sharing with their friends and they started a young Americans for freedom club at their school a page thank you so much for Israel Reagan Cheney is an awesome name and my name is ... so I Know something about awesome names or at least weird names

half\nWhen a widow Marcello ... uh talks to the cardinal if you like foreign art films is absolutely brilliant it's one of those where you watch it again and again figure out the layers and symbolism actual literal translation as who told you would come into the world to be happy\nI'm I knew it was from somebody smart I ... a very ... writer friend of mine is one who said it to me once but it's it's an important point who told you come into the world to be happy the answer is nobody really we are led to believe that by the society around us especially by the more\nCommercial and a self indulgent aspects of the society around this now because we live lives of what would have been inconceivable comfort if even\nA hundred years ago really in terms of our day to day needs and and all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole\nAnd happiness is not just about pleasure that's really where the that's really where the the breakdown I think comes in the in the way that we all exist today\nA Caroline red tape off you said something yesterday that that I've been thinking about for years the regional after so furious and on a hinge and so rabbit in their ... stations is because deep down they know they don't have logical on their side\nEvery one of their ideas when enacted results and failure they simply don't have a good historic

Shakespeare quoted the roll call always appreciate that\nAnd on July to let's get so upset yes I I think that the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons for their outrage right the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons that they are so\nUnreasonable when presented with the opposing point of view what people tell me I'm really wrong on something and I know I'm right I don't get angry I tend to be pretty calm and serene and self assured\nIf somebody tells me that I'm wrong on something and my first instinct is oh gosh maybe I'm wrong I I can get a little defensive

intentioned individual when it comes to this country and I just I think he's so wrong on all this I really do and I\nOwning gauge with him any more publicly because I I don't think that he's fair minded about what he said recently on Twitter so I'm not putting any confidence here but he said that what the Democrats did a Kavanaugh was bad but Kavanaugh's response was worse\nThat's just garbage I mean that's just not a defensible position that because he was snappy with them when they were calling him a gang rape is that's worse than ... than that that's just not it intellectually serious position and so for somebody who takes the position in\nGeneral as Tom does um that there's a lack of intellectual rigor among the Trump supporters I look I think that uh I think he's gone down the wrong path on this one he's not the only one who used to be a conservative\nAt least he's honest though I you know give him some credit for this he says he's a Democrat and now because he is he's a

F. A. B. [noise]\nThan\nWalking back to coast to coast limbic Tiger Woods Lin is one of the central voices and the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment in a way it is the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down and it the the hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works it\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just courted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about peace intention experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yes um and we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor of statistics look at this from the University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis has a home property crime went up went up in fairground and neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we get the intention so what's going on\nHere what do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case if we can share what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things\nAnd now you know I'm thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make it grow faster\nTo purify water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence\nAnd you know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effects\nDesigner trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now he'll things\nYou've ... you've been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the deep pack of the middle east and also a very prominent Israeli\n... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they can talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know\n... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was amazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic\nAnd it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive well that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we did an intention once for a kid called Luke who is Fifteen Years old\nWho tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot structure after his he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend\nAnd he'd broken everything he had brain damage he had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLook better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better you go to the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated\nBut here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting their mom you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona noted psychologist and a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been\nDoing working consciousness research I worked with the late ... I worked with people from from U. Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you\nKnow just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones who were sending intention to so we had no real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done\nWith the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists and then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the

you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at the immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nUm but one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on\nA with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we we actually get healthier\nBut the other big piece of this which is why not Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise] um that Vegas you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us\nSo that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow America America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be your mother that would be an interesting for\nWill you know we're doing one this at this Sunday I'm doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're gonna do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou were talking about a ... what does that\nMirror effect to me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change of all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was she ringing and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me was the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the out\nThat's pretty interesting but\nIt's more the active participation in what happens to people it changes a lot of that\nLynn
