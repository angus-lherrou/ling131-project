to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events squares with reality that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to either convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so\nDon't feel like I'm In any way trying to shut you down or shout you down I I just have to tell you I I strongly disagree with your entire premise on

background where we learn is lousy for ever had a substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWill we learn when she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should know to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six years ago\nMax let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for\nWhy is it that lousy Ford is a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was ah in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that none of that can be discussed that meanwhile Kavanaugh can be trashed\nWhy is that because he's accused I'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want

S. are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats and other ferman or out of the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide our water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers as me come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations to become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so ... or as opposed to dialogue and he this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth\nOf October in little thing but\nIt's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted no I've\nNever had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are of\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up new ... or ... ... email newsletter today

Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nWasn't slowing down it's really not happening it was a good movie though\n[noise] yeah okay it's actual thing right\nLet's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the bowl Keno these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll egg and they'll make\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John\nYeah ah my dad who uh who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're\nTalking about wind bills when I when I was living in Oregon\nOkay and I used to drive by the wind meals that they had\nI could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was plenty more boy blue flame\nYou know they were were burning off the methane\nGas were asking now why don't you put a generator on that and\nWe'll do ... you know electricity\nOut come back and they said no no no and it's going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be born in a methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas\nOr they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh\nUh agriculture um the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things\nThat's that's the only issue next\nLet's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having Steve\nVon Loor into spoken to him several times are hurting on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy a\nThere is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she knocked and they are the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are\nAre are using a bag lady I Believe you said a one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we would have\nJust been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a robbery or a young child than a\nHere's the point if you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right\nAnd and so so watch frosty has told us is that your section thinking that we can\nSee your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive rally improve their lives they're doing All right with out is just lost the war which a lot of them are are counting illegally into this country because they had been tricked\nAnd deceived into thinking they're going to get a better quality of life and they had\nDown there because you're having a lot more money in their pockets but yeah I didn't I didn't want to\nSuggest that we solve that problem by giving them money I don't think that's the right way I think the way is to uh\nIs to ah help ah teach 'em to use free markets and a property rights and um a lot of other sorts of things that would help those economies to grow and you know the good news is that a those are those are people are growing\nA we have about a about a\nI think it's about six hundred million people now that are under nourished across the world\nUh uh that's uh that's about\nThe little less than ten percent of the world's population used to be thirty percent of Thirty years ago so are people are are getting more nourishment or they're getting more food famine has been basically eliminated\nUm it used to be that every decade twenty million people across the world would die from famine that was in the early Nineteen hundreds now every decade it's less than a million people died so we are making a lot of progress but I didn't want to suggest that we just ship them money [laughter] uh you're right on that\nLet's go to another caller barbers in Los Angeles hey barb welcome to the program good to have you with us\nI I ... ... thing taken tasked with gas fine

eleventh did get a baby [noise]\nAnd\nWelcome back our final segment what Steve Moore I'm Steve when you're out of vents what seems to be the question that most people want answered\nWell um there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah\nBut the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business thinks that the climate laws and the energy laws are foolish and in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority are so it's a little bit of a strange situation\nUm [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm are they concerned about anything\n[noise] [noise] well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and low of two tenths and if you put those on a chart\nThose rights pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're we're below the estimates for the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the\nThe rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nWho's in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension or perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on the word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists\nThat is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky is the no doubt this a lot of\nSand but harp technology is\nAnd you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured lie you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite max that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite maps\nBut here's the thing that's interesting you can see storm front hurricanes tropical storms low pressure is on coming directly into California and they're being blocked and is being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters\nCould look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can he the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThey can steer hurricanes they can stall hurricanes they can blast thunder heads they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex which have in our with our weather\n... only hear about it in the news looks concedes reaction Bruce\nBruce that's something I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts spoke to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into it further\nLet's take one more call or maybe two if we have some time in and tell us oh go ahead [laughter]\nOh well Mr go higher than man just said is exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe that the weather pattern is being Gail engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George just recently I had a gentleman on a show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guys and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people have race so much heck let's use the word heck\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the game trails we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have the they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricanes to the age of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is in destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they go away you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't man ever come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing that trough I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham man they want they were doing a stripping the wealth of industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China's said so they're with their skies completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either is Russia but the United states of America was going to play the whole the whole town\nI don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham long\nSomebody had to wear out of time
