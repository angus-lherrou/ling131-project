doing the big special on it twenty five years ago\nUm what in the world happened back then\nI mean we know that this I saw it on TV a gigantic whale washed ashore where\nAnd and foreign Oregon Florida coast huh and so somehow\nI don't know where you entered the picture I mean did you see the whale know about the well before you know what\nWhat happened the art is at that time\nI worked for a national company and we had a plant here in Springfield, Oregon and we were planning to build a\nKind of a satellite plant in the Florence area to to utilize all the way from the middle of in that area down there and why I Want the farms in the workplace\nWe didn't want anybody to know when we were down there we were down there looking for a property auto we didn't want to uh you know a property goes when I Know you're looking for property all we found it becomes a lot more expensive\nThat's right so we had been\nTalking to Wilbur comic who was the port commissioner at that time I Believe he's port commissioner again he's the mayor found them by believers support them as a hell of a nice guy\nHuh so I got a logo air pollution\nGuy Vernon asking them and I had a realtor by mark ... and my twelve year old son and we had an appointment with Wilbur nine o'clock in the morning so\nWe got in a car or not we drove down to Florida and we want to the port commission off of them\nI walked in and announced that we were there and I said well Mr turned against him here because what he made his man we have an appointment at nine o'clock right and we were up by the way we're also trying to where we're going to promote a port revenue bond that the reason we were working through the Fort commissioner\nSo I I was aware of it that was out at the north Jedi but there's a lot of the oil washed ashore out there so\nWhen we got all the information we allow wants to fail we're here let's go see the oil well sure when we drove on out there quite a ways out there\nAnd it was a large pave parking lot and you can't see the ocean because there's a very a huge don't between the parking and and the ocean itself but we pulled into the parking lot and that was that just happened to be one spot left that we polled the car in there and\nThen we proceeded to walk and go up over top of the known when we got to the top of the nuclear deal\nFound that it at the uh the water's edge and sure enough there you are doing it twenty times sperm whale\nPlenty tons that's what they estimate it oh well there I'm sure it was every bit of that it looked a I saw people standing next to it and they were dwarfed yeah this was big\nSo we were able to fortunately get down and they were kind of keeping people back but but the vernacular the Appalachian guy knew Wilbur quite well and we were able to go right down there to to actually where the whale was in the smell you couldn't believe the smell of this thing I don't know how long this thing with dad but\nIt came ashore and and uh it was just it was just awful\nIt was on its way very very rare 'cause I'm\nBody of the night before had taken the chain on cut the lower jaw to get the pie by understand the teeth are hybrid\nOh no kidding yeah somebody had ripped off the the whole jaw\nSo's mutilated twenty John Wayne [laughter]\nSo we we kind of stood around there and shot him around there and they have the people there from\nThe highway to firemen and we were all kind of talking together and you know I said well what are you going to do and and a fellow that for my way to find me as well because I'm a blow it up I thought well you know okay not a problem so we've been through a while longer and all of a sudden\nThis caterpillar tractor come rumbling down across the fan with a with a huge bucket on the front of it in the bucket with twenty cases the sixty percent powder even though I figured I and I thought boy this is this going to be big trouble\nSo I said to this guy says why the hell are you going to do with twenty cases with dynamite yeah he says I'm On a blow it out to sea and I thought yeah\nYou're going to blow it up to the ice is and I says where are you ever come up with this formula and he says he talked to somebody and they said rule of thumb case of dynamite per common whale\nThat's on a whale yeah that's what that was a formula\nNow I Wonder if they might have derived from actually per ton of rock that you want to displace not I have no idea I mean how would you calculate away and\nHe said I'm On a day on the end and more time and we'll put the case of Donna I'm going to blow a mile to see well powder doesn't work\nThat way and and uh\nI got an aquatic you might say almost an argument about you're crazy you're going to kill somebody like you know if you want to obliterate the way they want to blow up a big rock with dynamite you put a few sticks of dynamite on the top and put them Sam on top of your crack it you'll never go underneath\nThis nicely with fan because than to slow down through the whole power you have is going to go straight up Mm\nAnyhow vernacular and Wilbur that that may come on I'm On a ... he says it's really none of your business anyhow and I says yeah and he says then the guy on the highway department he says he ... he says I Want to have everybody on top of them do up there\nAnd I don't know I'm I'm just curious on how did you know so much or I

F. A. B. [noise]\n\nThis all those many years ago was the actual ... H E you channel to news report\nThe whale of a tale the exploding whales story that many people have thought that in fact I recall now the panel thought was absolutely aware of its tail but a total lie well guess what it wasn't a total lie and here's channel twos reports from way back then\nHad to be set the Oregon State highway division not all they had a whale of a problem on its hands it had a stinking away all of a problem what to do with one forty five foot eight ton oil dead on arrival\nAnd the beach near Florence it's been so long since a whale and washed up in lane county nobody could remember how to get rid of one in selecting his battle plan the highway division decided the carcass couldn't be buried because it might soon be uncovered and couldn't be cut up and then very because nobody wanted to cut it up and it couldn't be burn\nSome dynamite it was some twenty cases or a half\nTon of it was just along that the seven grain way I Love the almost the Senate granted by the blast and any small pieces still around after the explosion will be taking care of by seagulls\nAnd other scavengers indeed the seagulls had been standing nearby all day I was everything was being made ready we asked George pardon the highway engineer in charge of the project for his final observations\nConfident that it'll work the only thing is we're not sure just exactly how much explosives it'll take to disintegrate this\nThing's so the scavenger seagulls and crabs and whatnot and clean it up\nIs there any chance that might be more than one day job [noise]\nIf there's any large chunks laugh and ah\nTo do some other clean up possibly set another charge\nDynamite was buried primarily on the ... side of the big mammals\nAs most of the remains will be blown toward the sea about Seventy five bystanders most of them residence went first found the well to be an object of curiosity before they tired of it smell were moved back quarter of a mile away the sand dunes there were covered with spectators inland lover newsman Charlotte has become a land\nOf blubber news now with a blast blasted lover beyond all believable bound [laughter]\nWhat's going on now on the screen\nIs a countdown sin nine eight seven six five four three two one [noise]\n[noise]\nOur cameras rolling immediately after the blast the humor of the entire situation suddenly gave way to run for survival is huge chunks of well blubber everywhere\nPieces of meat past high over our heads while others were falling at our feet the dunes were rapidly evacuated the spectators escape the falling debris and the overwhelming smell\nA parked car over a quarter of a mile from the blast site was talking to one large chunk the passenger compartment literally smashed fortunately no human was hit as badly as the car over everyone on the scene was covered with small particles of Dan Quayle\nAs for the success of the effort on the seagulls who were supposed to clean things up we're nowhere in sight either scared away by the explosion or kept away by the smell that didn't really matter\nThe remaining chance we have such a size that no respectable Segal would attempt to tackle anyway as darkness began to set in the highway crews were back on the beach burying the remains including a large piece of the carcass which never left the blast site\nThat might be concluded that should've whale ever washed ashore and lane county again those in charge will not only remember what to do they'll certainly remember what not to do [laughter]\nSo uh\nThat was a report um Walt I'm I just want to give them one more little plug here and then it's back to you look at this report has only a at one other time in all it's twenty five year history been released to anybody to run and that was too I think Kay geo in\nSan Francisco that did a piece on it and so I feel very honored that I'm Katie you allowed us to run it\nI was wiring a finale or a ... uh [noise] I'm trying to think of a play or\nDoesn't matter wherever it was you were doing the show yeah and we're wiring a finale and I was talking to this guy on old explosive guy and uh\nHe told me about a story when ever oh somewhere in Europe blowing bridges up and he said uh you know kid when you want to blow something up that my teacher told me\nYou figure out how much dynamite you need and your double it and got her mind me of that guy telling me the story\nIs there actually want any way to calculate how much dynamite it would have taken to as they wish to do a Bolivia eight or turn into little tiny particles I thought I\nI think what they should have done up they were going to use the closer it over with but some may be the case or two and a single stick on top of the well put ... on top of it so it was\nYou were kind of blow it and ... a part in place more or less you fill out the bury the peace\nBut at least you'd have smaller pieces to bury\nYeah but and but uh this guy thought he was gonna by putting the dynamite on the board side he figured he was going to blow the whole thing off the ocean ... it didn't work that way ...\nWildcard lined you're on the air with Walt I'm an opera hello hello\nHi yeah er about oil yes the right thing to do is Buddha bought across the way I\nDo watch a bill Marr a steel bar yeah I voted across the royal yes\nAnd then die or open drag it out to sea then you blow it up that's what they probably could have done if I if I remember that time there was a pretty good fight against foreign and if they had to go you know got a big lead or something and put around it and put them behind them I didn't grow up without a couple of miles and then touched it off\nWell see that's why I really the only part of this story that I don't have and I wish I could get and I will pursue is the genesis of it when these guys were sitting around whether it was in an office or in a bar after work whatever you know how they came up with this\nThat would be good to know the minutes of the meeting where they planned it\nSomewhere he got a rule of thumb case a dynamite per ton a whale\nPer ton of well I did you spend a lotta time arguing with him that this was\nNot well I I got cut off pretty quick you know a ... you don't argue with it with a bureaucrat when he's in charge\nAnd when I tried in the interview uh he seemed very confident\nVery confident yeah now did you you must have seen that interview actually going on yeah yeah oh you did so uh there there he was young he looked pretty proud and he was only attitude after all of this was over\n... collectively was that he had not used enough dynamite\nThat that's I that's why they pulled the guy from Sports Illustrated\nA west of the Rockies are running out of time you're on the air with well I'm an opera Hi\nHello art bell

fresh did and the city made an activity out of utilizing every bit of the whales as\nThe old way others did ... the bones mom for practical purposes\nWell I think uh this is just to hazard a guess but walled from what you've told me of the condition of the whale uh it's not something you'd corner up and take home for the dinner table\nIt was pretty rank I don't know how long the thing that's been dead but it was kind of ... you know\nCome I got ... ... oh that's often well listen I don't know how to thank you ...\n... right you have helped 'em a correct or actually\nVerify what until now has

costs incurred taking advantage hockey at a chart the\nPublic will never believe the innocence of the Clinton and they're loyal staff the wall Street Journal editorial editors live without consequences I was not meant for the job\nOr the outline of public life of Washington Here ruining people is considered a sport\nAnd that's it that's it\nThe part that really grabbed me was they are just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believe the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed all up and said you know he said any time you have a note that suddenly appears when there needs\nTo be such a duck and then it seemingly benefit someone it's just the immediate cause for concern and of course here you have so many destroying the state and federal all the experts bleed statement had been taken from other documents\nThat he had bad maybe had Britain and other contact and had been\nPut together a good word you will always try to imitate known writing\nSo or if they're trying to Fort well of course of course so you what\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because it's been off for apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for a good by world\nAnd yet that sounded like kind of a summary note nevertheless I mean some are rising everything to this point and with some something in mind without having that suicide it did sound kind of final summation of the failure or however you want to look at it\nThere at the press conference there were a number of reporters the number of TV networks I don't think that ran on any of the television network\nWell there we come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story had been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out of their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC\nOh really yeah how could they possibly ignore\nEvidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS could choose to ignore it or protecting its sixty minutes division\nBut what about the other is and what about the Associated Press and what about you know I mean does the\nPractice the major news\nOutlet the country and they didn't send a reporter and then they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a full news story or at least a dispatch I mean here Reuters did a major dispatch twice the length that they usually do on these type of story\nAnd the a P uh editor for Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story a they have it's a coup paragraph\nLiterally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in in Washington\nA panel of experts has declared that the foster noticed and notify the government can otherwise blah blah blah but\nThis is now panel of three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come to that you know OK\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park police totally mishandled that that nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like there are any no one document\nTo make it certification which is exactly what the park police and the FBI good for the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I\nLove my article what you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and be on the head of the question document unit at the bureau thank you know he wanted a minimum of ten documents\nWell the only that was funny that you know the liberal yeah vi\nCrime lab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows that may be a lot of crime going on there\n[noise] [noise] well sticking with the note for a second the declaration that it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell there's a couple of reasons why first of all there was a great qualify for fishing because the note\nIs found in a briefcase the search the police at that they were suspicious of the fact that that brief case\nBy them with empty but not looked at it second it um benefited or people at the White House and took the onus off approving the\nThird and\nIt was born\nAnd apparently the experts at any time you have a a document question document that corn mutilated crumple from the old on it it is often times an effort to make it come\nPower than difficult difficult sure they'll already\nYou have a primary ... at the English experts at a physician then you look at the no\nAnd the first of all the don't if you look at a you know which we have a photocopy of we had a huge blow up a write in comparing you can see that they did not match that the way he stroke structured are gone the flow the slant of the letters is not the fame\nSo then from make clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nWell it is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say the letter B. right you might only write\nThat letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top go down at the bottom you've rounded out and then\nThe last stroke is going over the next letter the end of the stroke\nBut ... born here will not do it that way he'll write the line down they'll stop the stroke you might take the bow of the letter B. and start from the top of bringing around\nAnd you can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter ... for example um was done in three stroke structured trope\nUnlike officer who had a very tenuous and the style of writing uh-huh which you can uh we had a dolphin document a week or two or three different fourth\nI'm so very very clear that we ah that that that it it is an match\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point like you like me like anybody who's got anything to do is saying what we're saying right now\nBut this has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step and so you're asking a couple of things aren't you you want based on this report you want more coverage you want\nWhat what where do we go from here if you were in charge of the investigation viewer or the other person pursuing this story right now other than as a journalist ... you know in a visual charge and you realized you had a forgery on your hands where do you go\nWell if I with Ken Starr yeah I realized I had a forgery\nI Would realize immediately that there's a strong likelihood is looked at the conference today that the bird you have a much stronger case that it was part of that if it was just the ... thought they wouldn't have got to dislike the cover it up\nEither way though it's a president stopping story possibly in other words it's up production of ...\nObstruction of justice and uh that will take the president ... every dime if he was aware of it\nWell whether he was aware of it or not you know Nick\nDidn't want them to barely aware of the burglary or\nA apparently admitted stray should they be the the burn aware much that goes on\nThat okay say good and close to the phone you're getting hard to hear yeah they're all cats better I'm so obstruction of justice at the least murder maybe at the most\nObviously there was an effort\nTo conceal mislead confused police investigators in to the top ... belief that catered to this case we have to remember that William fashion the head of the FBI was fired the day before fourth fifth death I Do recall and he has charged\nIn a written statement that his firing led to a quote compromise unquote investigation often at\nAll right Chris on on a second we'll be right back to you\nUh this is big news um with all of the other inconsistencies that\nI'm Chris has listed for us in the past this goes to me way beyond in inconsistency this is not quite but well maybe it is kind of a smoking gun\nIf you leave me now it

come in contact with different piece of paper Mr ... said his statement that they can ... the fact that they had no fingerprint\nFor no late impression on these papers is consistent with the person who tore it having one gloved\n[noise] [noise] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic stories so the Associated Press now you give me what you can I knew this is touchy territory Chris writer\nWhile the eight paying today promise the number of people that call on the media world here in Washington and elsewhere that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know a short story but it would be a story\nAnd when people were calling up the yeah we did it we're doing it or we did it while we find out what it meant was to paragraph three paragraphs at the end of a very long article on white water and Senate hearing\nUm which is a typical way of burying a strict here they're talking about all these things going on with pain is and I think by the way three experts are saying that the notice of forgery which is like you know sort of thing\nYou know riding on the news after the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima you know talking about what happened with between the Yankees and the White Sox and thing by the way at the end of that story you know there was a bomb dropped on Hiroshima\nAnd you know just patently ridiculous\nSo it was Frank okay so what happened to the AP so we're\nTold that a that this decision was made at the highest level that the a P A\nThe the the story would be run this way right at the higher going to do a story\nThat ah the AP reporter was frustrated with not allowed to write one and I'm In\nMinot ... has a very close relationship with the Associated Press and very rarely does stories get on the eight people are that are critical of the administration I mean even Clinton I'm making a comment about flip flopping on taxes\nAgain that was a story that the Reuters writer wrote a piece didn't carry that\nThis is got to bring it to critical mass now I'm going to do it I just confirmed the number I don't just give out numbers without confirming a them I'm going to give the audience the Washington Associated Press bureau number\nA there should be outrage the audience should be aware if you call it in all probability they're going to say well\nWe ran it just as Chris told you they will say but it was buried they rented they rented so that it well almost wouldn't be read and that's\nOutrageous this is a gigantic stories so the Washington Associated Press bureau number is\nAnd uh uh you know the chips will have to pull away they may they fall on me that I'll just take that take that ah when it comes\nYou know um I take it you've given some amount of sun to this though I mean what was\nSo look if in fact a this was a murder I Am one of the crime people behind expose again yeah I guess that's what I'm saying well look and look what you know\nHere Mike Wallace did this teeth and I think I said this to you on the last time you know my brother called me up afterwards he said ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never want it to a big job on Wall street type\nI just watch this and that makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money\nYeah I took a pay cut to continue doing this story\nUm\nSo what do you say I mean how do you how do you argue against that Mike Wallace knew that they knew that I'd never reported that foster with left handed a first that with the Boston Globe but I was going to be held responsible for every hour there's any newspaper if they ever done in this case\nUm eat only indicates to people out there that do look into it\nThat I'm On the right track and only indicates to me I'm On the right track when they have to make such a ... near one Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old at the dean of American television journalism has to bring down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows that I'm having an impact\nWell ... if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is and I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control of very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but\nYou you could almost begin to leave that could be so because of the associated ... abreast under re boarding because of sixty minutes going after you as they did\nI'm an because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and well I think not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it sends a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nWell or the king media I don't know if everyone but the key media the the leaders on sixty minutes the lead program you know Don you it has gone on the record he's the producer sixty minutes saying that he helped get plenty of what Clinton elected\nAfter the Gennifer Flowers thing that he edited that tape and such a way that he remained recast Bill Clinton a candidate\nUm you know ABC News has a very close association with this administration of former

information sure that I was getting out of the magazine that I was describing to\nThere are there are certain similarities in the way the Washington Post had to doggedly pursue under criticism um the story now that is what is happening here now how long is the ... been in this condition I don't know he was well is it laziness how back in\nThose days I think uh you know nobody want to report on what Kennedy was doing a because it was at the right guy to the the spirit of the times in those days was that we leave the president alone the dirty things about the president alone go our way back to to uh\nNot not quite true we leave the the womanizer sing or the bruising or the personal things\nYeah out but not this kind of thing\nBut over time the the scrutiny to which a public official has a ban hell has has got more and more you know we we kept FDR's wheelchair out of out of uh many people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair and nowadays you know we know what kind of underwear Fresno where's my life\nWhere they're yeah like we're supposed to chairs around\nBut it was interesting I used to have to give an update to my friends back in the states about what was going on with the Watergate investigation out because I got it out of the London paper and I got out of the ah ah English a printed a German newspaper\nI don't know what else you do with this look you don't ignore it that's all you don't ignore it I I guess maybe according to a lot of reports on getting of the Associated Press may have switched off their phones or they may be so overloaded that you know who knows I Hope it's true\nYeah the whole thing just thanks pretty badly it has for the whole time\nOr have had quite an air to quite there's too many I answer things you know who bumped in to Princeton [laughter] ah there's just I guess at the age of unanswered questions like who was it that bumped on the back of ... will always be the unanswered question you know and who was that a life that's foster out with no blood\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and sale you know as Nixon did nobody ... nobody wants that for American nobody in their right mind could want that\nAnd I know this is on clay feet\nI Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy are both you know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but ... you know as I'm planning on this tasteful as it is if it is something that needs to be dealt with it is something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nUm do we are we still the country we once were do we still pursue the truth or do we not care anymore and I guess we'll find out by finding out how many people call up the Associated Press ads area code too old to\nSeven seven six Ninety four hundred and demand they give this the tension the attention it deserves\nThat's all that's all anybody is asking right now you're done a good job of our thanks for the call in other words Eric thank you you got a\nForensic experts world class stating unequivocal believe that this is a forgery the note was a forgery now your mind does not have to do a lot of work\n\nOr to see where where would lead from there and it's not a good place I sat at a minute ago nobody in their right mind wants to see another presidency fail and I'm not even saying that would occur\nBut you could imagine it would be close or there it's all horrible from I Lived through Watergate I remember it I was politically aware during Watergate it was awful\nIt was um actually it was the breaking of the virginity of the American people\nAre innocence was lost up piece out of terrible wrenching piece at a time as that whole thing began to unravel um it was\nOf the end of the way America was\n\nAnd nobody wants to see that happen again\nBut the alternative is absolutely horrendous the alternative is an America where it may be possible for the government to manipulate the media where it may be possible for the government to commit crimes\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk it away by saying that it's I'm a conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals\nA great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised [noise] first time caller line you're on the air\nI hello\nI can barely hear you you're gonna have to get into the phone and shout out is\nOh okay I'm In here and yes ma'am and that last night\nOr someone Carter was that the um hay on Bob\n... comment yes right and they said if he fell off it did yes ah\nOh I don't think you mentioned that last night the kid there are\nNo idea I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight but that you had asked will we get a warning I did\nWell well I mean in in sort of a general way I have yeah sure if a comet where to hit earth would we know about it yeah\nWell I'm On a April twenty third on your program ...\nYes and has a topic with Catholic [noise] profit I think yes correct\nAnd he said that the boy the end no warning with the great act of mercy and I'll Fight cross would appear and the guy that might have out there\nUm well All right thank you it may be man it may be and uh there was interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the a piece that broke off which by the way is not in the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a spiral\nUm and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that is broken off that is not thirty percent of the comet\nOr somebody worried [laughter] it is a piece that\nIs reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off at you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is your break off ... and you've got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get right\nThe question is a good question is why is it right at All right to another words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you were talking about the nucleus of the comet itself or abused that breaks off\nThere should not be enough energy from the sun to be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we\nWill question or Richard whole gleaned about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that program friday night Saturday morning got a lot to say I'm not so much about the common but we will again ask about that because there must be\nEnergy to create the burn off that creates the reflected light that we see and where is that energy coming from east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning I'm calling from um the lady just call up too long ago yeah about about the guy or directed outer\nThat's a true story I've got a copy of the store right here by an Associated Press writer uh-huh and the newspaper and it shows a man picketing in the theater at the\nEnd do me would you do me a big favor yeah would you facts that to me\nI'm not able to because I'm\nAll right I'm then fine let me just ask that somebody fax it to me and I guarantee they will and as soon as they do we'll talk about it\nOkay how's that going to ride\nSo somebody out there with a fax machine God Knows we've sold enough of them a fax me that article and I'm Glad to cover it I just want to be very careful very cautious I'm sure it's totally on the up

I I think what was ... I\nI mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail that is kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them than anyone\nI didn't write ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their belief only things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some ... this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole\nStarted to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October which will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the week that the states is open and I I I Would never have guessed shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but it but the other but what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now we're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round as failing grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want tourists to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that it's actually a ... year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance the er the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century a graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\n'cause they're just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there's there's on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over ... start hitting the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally lately and ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to shut it kept pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train and it takes some time so by midnight money around on Halloween of\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was it just gets bad [laughter] not really that there\nAre they going to get them up before the ... or maybe they're doing the real which happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list\nOf things that are have a great night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to Ross well in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back\nOn Halloween of sorry on Thanksgiving weekend\n... ...

gun job when\nTraining in your next opportunity begin at for eastern catch up with post market coverage on after the bell\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric\nThe focus on the acts of the killer or to satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice\nAnd on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the ...\nAnd not run for your life\nOr all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to\nBe mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate about who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today so\nI ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that\nThey um [noise] there's all their equipment deer graphic patterns and the murders if want occurs just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland a so that that would be a link between them the uh uh one thing that is odd is that he would\nHe would take a laugh from inside the house term they way way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light take the chairman a awful lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders and the other thing is that he would put poet blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood\nFrom flying back and hitting hitting him as he was ordering someone who you are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and go into the early twentieth century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the town that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin and it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed that ... another\nThing I've got mentioned there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he very may have ... what it is first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plant that probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about the America's most elusive serial killer at Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nDumb luck and it is not all of them are\n... I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading\nCrime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks but very often the serial murder when he convinced his first crime\nReveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would cover his tracks so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case ... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston is first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight\nNorth of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth\nAnd because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and\nIt's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points that first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series\nSo are we is just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find\nConvincingly who was actually doing this but\nWe found a\nEvidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype Chris Rock he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successfully after that it is is the years went\nForward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the\nTime after about Nineteen oh five the ah I think that he while he use an ax to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe\nMy belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um it was not what he was trying to do but it is why he would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next dumber but before I Do ... ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of our ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me\nI don't know you but they're they're part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves\nThat we are ashamed of the uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader ... by the way at the last book I read was the real crime but with the real Lolita\nOr it's a book by I'm about to Weinstein a I Believe it's Weinstein I could have a ... lives\nName wrong or the or I've [laughter] I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there surely are gonna be his\nAnd one of the things I've learned from reading that is the white American walk off\nIt was a an avid reader crime stories uh Charles Dickens for them at an avid reader crime stories or energy fielding it it's very common among writers avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nThat you do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports I mean I live in the sports world for the most part that sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try to positive thing\n... hang on to that thought on crime stories that just pick it up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed a coast to coast am Suzie in on it\n[noise] here's another CEOs use you know earn radio\nWe welcome Dr ...

I've I've I don't know a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think what we can go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book and a lot of the\nBook is about is is that all all all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book is is\nTrying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago\nAnd I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these ... that these murders occurred to him and I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the story was powerful to me\nBut I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a watery or what how people lived\nThat they they lived rich meaningful live a ... people in\nUrban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in fall have hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of this\nThings that happen to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that\nThat happened to happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they live or die terrible Beth\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age\nOr the way the houses were constructed ... communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are and then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that those traits that point you were just banking and that has to do with the the taco in the case of soccer and then that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on\nDecember twenty four of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd Italian community um a\nPickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because you're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's it's a tiny detail that\nYou would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the tally in American\nCommunities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know that I think that brings us do you think could lead to ...

men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so [laughter]\nSo it goes wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nUh you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of entire family and a lot of that is a is a rare that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders and that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding\nBut so is let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually\nNarrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example is an including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but happen in Central America or happened in in ... wherever and so they were able to try to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder\nSo it's it it's a ... it but you have to you almost have to START I mean it it's a quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe I'm\n... you know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that a name could even be found\nGiven the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries during that period\n[noise] intervention that Jack the ripper case I Am I read I read probably twenty books dying jak river was this guy or doctor was that guy or jak\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened um speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which\nMakes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just some barking and come to the United states\nWell I don't know and you know there is speculation\nIn the book has a lot of things we don't know about you how are you you're going to have no after you can have a speculative

known profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was that uh the um well he had several observations about the ... the crime that lined up with what we believe\nFor other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean it is\nOn the chart of how organized as this burger this guy is unbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that rubber ... Kelly who was accused of the burgers and ... really couldn't have gone it hey because his mind is very disorganized\nBut also because he was not physically strong enough\nUm we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah\nThere's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked profile or for his opinion I
