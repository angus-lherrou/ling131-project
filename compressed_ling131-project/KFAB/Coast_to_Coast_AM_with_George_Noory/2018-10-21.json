approval of the Senate almost inevitably a\nJust like rubber stamps or they were approved\nYes I I realize that I I I Would just uh for some reason with thing to do\nWith that I have a little bit more conservative or a thinking on when when he goes to a point the judges then went to\nI Would certainly like to think so but the record would be that he helped confirm those that were sent to him by

actually been repealed [noise]\nAh when did that occur\nOccurred when the Supreme Court quit hearing any cases I\nWell I'll tell you something it it may be well that they're not hearing cases on it because there are maybe a case\nTo suggest that it would be a state's rights issue and that the Supreme Court ah would say the second amendment only applies state by state I once asked I interviewed judge Bork and that's what he said that's what he said he believed\nIt could be the tenth amendment does give us that\nSo I wouldn't be too much of a hurry especially in the present climate\n[noise] yeah but for for the last three years the Supreme Court has refused to hear any case on the second amendment\nThat's what I said you may you probably ought to be saying thank you because that leaves

thought we should have done the show on what might have been under those things are in the ... or whatever but what was being argued was near term extremely important\nAnd um so like some people were disappointed they said well they want to talk about what was in there or not the politics of what was going to be done to get in there but it's so uh right on top of is that it wasn't important arguments very important\nOh right but I had I had kind of a a philosophy question for you if you held a conference call\nAnd you had like Wayne Green Richard whole Glenn stand tail and that through

subjects to reveal their core wisdom in simple clear English the first time Thomas heard this wisdom was when he attended one of Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person on the radio and in September twenty twelve he spoke with a prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of and light meant\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nFor these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um\n[noise] he um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychics but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to\nSay back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that a young student who had done the boxing team to punch them in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and they were having them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time that this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting\nIt at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why he passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the\nStrength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake comedian he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know if a on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to the sky or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer we take a picture and and the you know the fake media would be totally surprising where are you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to\nPull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry write them\nUp that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that\nGuy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right\nIt was I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... is there are so Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet a Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife uh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them\nThat got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading\nFor Harry where she claimed that he brought\nShe bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved\nBut he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\n... no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate against the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other\nIn order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to anybody that interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in\nEach word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly to the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety

enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her or so so what happens\n[noise] um Arthur Ford shows up and he Arthur Ford\nUsually works with the spirit name Fletcher\nAnd Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world is a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened\nAnd they were able to make it kind of a um like a show a very theatrical show where\nHarry would work with best the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd ah there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten key words on the table and then they coated them and after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that's his nickname that Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song\nRight around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe and it really really\nTouched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted does anyone know Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the pet name for best or was this common knowledge\nAs fun as it is and it is exciting it is it is not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's\nIt puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't\nBelieve that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nShe did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden\nShe's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so he's pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur for its been contacted by her beloved Harry that that\nThat quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um\n[noise] tell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live\nAnd he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to his prove the survival of consciousness and I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to do this mistake\nHow all those who lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue with\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic media those are the were\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com is the both the paperback and an e book and I do want to point out one interesting thing I'm Dr Gary Swartz wrote the book the afterlife experiments and he was a guest with art do all those years ago and I recently heard that Gary sports\nHas Harry Houdini as a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona about\nFashion that's fantastic well we'll have to get to Dr Schwartz on the program again and follow up\nOn that yes thank you so much for

buying them but do you get also some pushback because you're you're this is kind of uncomfortable for some people you're you're pulling their their reality out from under them\n[noise] yeah I'm really

because I haven't heard of him\nYou know like a question about who's in our life there sure you're gonna have and I was\nSo I have to be very careful when I write the books not to fall into

four or five books that I start to look into that one might make it will be information that I bought it so it's not like I just say well that's right [laughter]\nIt's not worth it and I'm actually a

it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes it stings um but you it needs to say\nYou don't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned\nA communism although you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalinist Russia and the er the programs in the the the the forced a started nations in the Ukraine and so forth\nUm but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about uh someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nA paint me I'm a ... a portrait of a young FDR\nNo yeah I was a I always say who's beneficiary of the lucky sprung up this\nGuy was born in the way through\n[laughter] you know I mean is it they were just sitting in the

sees all the way through school or he'd rather roof off\nPlay football and so forth and uh it was a well hey here's what was it I Want to use but he was a new something it was really a you know\nIt was it was really something I think that anyone was there for the asking and his political where it started out in the Los about Maine and in how when the physicians and they blossom them being governor of new or by the people don't know what I was governor early or are they forgot but they're just not talking about it any more\nOr less you know he he was the road will mean now he just talked to him [laughter] over Roosevelt was born a Roosevelt Roosevelt fighter Roosevelt which was a little odd or the woman got ready to change the monitor ... part of life actually [laughter] you know I'm\nYou know I mean this is the evolution of a good person\nHis cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was he a second or third cousin\nWho was the second was\nRight and and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he received his younger cousin and the Democrats\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about that\nBecause that was just not the way but he was raised with a that Roosevelt name was trying to find out if he was a ... a full on you know the special in that comes\nOut so he did a lot of things are without unsavory ban some self marrying his cousin is funding a number\nTeddy Roosevelt you know that in public it was awful lot of ways so you know he was a ... benefitted from the Roosevelt man as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York lots of you know he was he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have the um\n... I I think of George Bush a senior in trying to buy succeed Kmart back in the ... member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's

FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd uh he's certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it in a horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banking system had failed and it's just sort of paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had Orange County going and of course\nWe remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you\nSo it was pretty good evidence to support that uh you know the same you know to support that conclusion that said they definitely had a as a matter of fact the History Channel broke it\nI think last year I was watching something on the History Channel they even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find the archive suggests that that very thing the codes were broken and I thought well hey look it up you know I mean I I hate I knew I got it right but I didn't know how to write I got it so that was ... I was right on the money with the\nRight but as you as you or any great teams going out and you just mentioned this earlier that the Germans are in their T. V. to rocket program\nI'm almost ... they were getting close to being able to deliver um nuclear bombs and had the United states not done yet\nA when they did it may have been too late and imagine nuclear weapons attached to those me two rockets raining down on on England\nYou know it's incredible uh it's just absolutely incredible when you think about the situation um you know America is an economic chaos they know they have to get into this war for many reasons to the to spark the economy as well and ah it was just in the he had to FDR was put in a real bad situation\nAnd you know in the first chapter of my book I paint FDR is kind of a villain and I have to do that to set up the murder so I Apologize in advance for anybody reads and gets a time when FDR had to sell\nOur country on this war and I believe he had to sacrifice Pearl Harbor and the lives that I Know it's a terrible thing to say but I I think that's that's how it happened\nIn order to galvanize public support\nRight yeah 'cause he he had already been saying this was Europe's war this is Europe's were well between the the ... the global economy which is not doing anything and the necessary time to get into the war coming through our spies and it was he knew it was time to break gut wrenching decision very gut wrenching decision\nSo that that's a that's how that came in to pass you know\nNow that before we get into the U.S in World War two FDR's relationship with Churchill and and then later style\nAnd I'm starting to remember about sort of the enemies list that he had already cultivated through you know the overregulation ... and and uh with with the big corporations in the United states\nOh boy\nAh [laughter]\nThis guy had a you know there were enemy he hated money you're related and in fact ... as much as he get his\nHands on so [noise] um you know he really\nAnybody who was interested in industry are making money it was definitely not his friend I mean he really pissed off some powerful people\nUm I'll run through the list here are the ones that I came up with um the dupont family um George Eastman from Eastman Kodak hurry Firestone\nSame old Colgate Colgate toothpaste or Henry Ford\nParents still head I'm Henry Frick Heinz family the Hilton family who had hotels the melon family who was in charge of the world banks um William top man who was the president of Liberia and even um ...

Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but you know again I'm history books being what they are that times are you the last\nUm [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of the tree and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way um\nAnyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing their island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go and laid on airstrikes\nBomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially with France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with a brush\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with um never trust them\nI'm of course to admit previously and I'm sure she'll really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with you chose the one who\nGather together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nThey were so similar to the time that style and in America\nAnd the the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally\nHe had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends so you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill liked it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely\nTrusted that FDR wasn't going to be calm and smiling only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great birds I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful Sean Connery\nNow I mean there's ... there's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ...\nMillion FDR it seemed and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we need it's balanced island and he does he was already\nYou know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on that on march to Moscow and they were doing good they're doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he decided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was such\nA delusional dictator at the at this time\nHe thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so Stalin is already\nBeating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think\nIn a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving out the post war world a instill at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still looks pretty robust\nOr you know he you know by by standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy by by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards\nBecause deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents were declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders on call me crazy so you can really go back and pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so\nI'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing a there's a large aspiring American history thirty three members and they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything if they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another Nazis firing eight members\nOr they were created after Pearl Harbor\nOr they attacked salient targets and has a stake and they were all caught and I believe\nEach one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones\nThey ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah\nAbsolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt\nRoosevelt is I'm White House it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the\nParallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years every five years or whatever what have you oh this you know this was all history is not all of his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another of another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist completely frustrated oh I'm FDR's White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure down the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating his White House\n\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety One the red hot chili peppers kick off their blood sugar sex magic tour where they show and Madison, Wisconsin

great ... and the famine in Russia under Stalin\nAnd most of them or anybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well it never ceases to amaze um I just wanted to check everything is because people need to know it's you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and the three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late\nSo I'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world are so much of the post\nWar world is a result and then then the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition his greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference and y'all\nTo in forty four when when that post war world\nWas really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt frail condition or and and um FDR really didn't know what happened he just was so out of it but\nI mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the altar conference and obviously he is is he looks like death warmed over but seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks as as fit as a fiddle I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nAnd they failed at this point I think Bruins is you know or doctor mcentire was on record as saying you know what are we getting here in two weeks you'll be right is rain again and he always bounces back he was preparing to open I think the the United Nations um you know you're on the United nations session they they had every reason to believe\nFDR would bounce back after two each rest correct\nYeah that's that's what the the doctors were that's what they're thinking but if you can look at the pictures in my book\nAnd uh some people I tell you what some people like this book better than they owe this book and they all of us were people like a different part of history World War two you know I mean people will they seem to like this book almost as well some of them better\nThere's pictures in my book of the deterioration from one conference for months or on the altar and you can see what his he's being transformed into\nSo I don't know what his doctors were thinking about I don't get it but I can read you the laundry list of ailments um that came out\nUm the advance of polio is joining ... joined in muscle weakness of the an increase muscular pain I'm being fatigue or exhausted um atrophy or the muscles trouble breathing sleep apnea and becoming cold okay this is the advance of polio\nThis is not the laundry list that doctor Dr Ley he discovered when he did this\nOr you know work up on this guy he I'm not gonna I'm not going to a bore everyone with us 'cause a laundry list is incredible\nBut everything from cardiovascular to mental intellectual issues sensory motor ... perception gastrointestinal his nervous system was shot his kidneys were shot or his or he was this heart was racing out of control this is not the advance of polio\nAnd this has been kept from us for Seventy some odd years because of that memo from from Dr Frank way he has been kept from us\nHe had terrible tremors to he could barely holding light a cigarette\nOh yeah it was it was and it was incredible he was calling things why the wrong name he couldn't yeah he was just shaking all over the place so here these doctors um you know mcentire Bruins and pollen and trying to figure out there were so baffled they take this guy to a surgeon\nHe's got\nBlood pressure that's out of control\nAnd they want to take him there for X. rays you know blood pressure doesn't show up on X rays I I have no idea what they had no idea what they were doing but again it's not the fault these men it was time period involved they didn't know what we're looking for so every now and then you get lucky with a murder and I ...

this that they would do and how I got away with it but my God all that somebody to look at like make sure that if you were a darling did a lot of that\nAnd I think it would are the ones that he would go to ... he wanted Roosevelt cooking it's written him over the world that are drawn in a you know and all that and gotten to do\nAfraid of the tournament I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I I think he did not want to want to deliver quality possibly that's just my my take on it All right interesting John ... bad shape you going to die anyway All right Steven you want to reply [noise]\nUm\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been sold 'em have bone slanted okay I'm not suggesting that what you said has been\nHe look so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison\nThat's why he looks so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance on polio and it's filled it out very very plainly and my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history there's an awful lot of people who research this and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as Stalin style in one of the rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he signed something to look in the ... in the end of the coffin someone to verify what was going on he was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he\nDied so if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that I didn't if indeed that had happened it was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nHi John thank you that's an interesting point there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia Hi James good morning welcome to coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess for my question for Mr ... is there still are banning it in your research physical or did you come across or anything about this just this folded up an attempted coup against a Roosevelt in the thirties and that\nUh if it happened if you came across it how close was it a\nHappening and that the coolest ... uh it was a exposed by an army general smelly butler and that one of the people involved was a I think was a Garth or did you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come to happening um if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told a it's a Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today\nAnd there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so\nA handful of players could really influence things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market so when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why\nWhen a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that in this\nAnd if you actually see the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote it takes a trip to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff\nSo that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it there were there and then when he came from\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's old money so you know just kind of a ... of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but that that um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brame and so it was very well the east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well\nYeah I heard\nThat about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging you guys are never written a book let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter]\nBy the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach your name so you want to be as best they can\nYou know of course as\nFar as like the I I still get fascinated by stuff somebody will call in and say that you know the ... and because it wasn't that long ago really Seventy plus years ago you know one girl got a hold of me and\nHer mother or her aunt was the cook from Warm Springs Georgia amazing it's\nJust absolutely blew my mind I mean it is so we're not is not that long ago I mean a grander scope of things it's

article\nHoudini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nFor these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to\nKill him but I think they wanted to say back off\nAnd we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um that young student who had bound boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and what happened to come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting\nIt at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer and the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something like this guy or whatever and lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd that you know the fake media would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to\nPull off his mask and so these guys are very second\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so that guy had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in\nI just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... is there are so Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yet a joy ... was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive\nAs the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual and yet he's good friend and his wife uh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a ... to find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved\nBut he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI sort of outed or in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this that play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method\nThat that Harry in best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method um\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in\nEach word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly to date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer
