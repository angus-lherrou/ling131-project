don't know John is that happened were behind the puck I suppose this week\nThat seem strange to me when you get that out sooner\nWrites buck thanks again for your great show Katie thank you for your great message now I Need some advice to help resolve the political dispute\nMy dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in our upcoming state election in Mississippi we're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who is skewing the truth to the point of lies and who perhaps has been involved in\nQuestionable a pub a publicity schemes the other is an establishment centers former Democrat I'm not looking for an endorsement for either\nBut for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty Kennedy that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust devote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion Katie Katie a very a very a thoughtful question from you thank you so much for writing it\nUm [noise] well you know since I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised this\nIs just a question of establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations is is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who vote the way I Want or act the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want in a politician\nAnd I have to say that I've evolved on this issue of it I I think that\nAh principles are most important for you and your day to day life but principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and you have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless so I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle of mix look what happened with justice capital\nI think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now that varies I mean there's\nThere's people that are shady and there's people who are who are\nGrotesque and and deeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take\nA trustworthy on policy but shady personally conservative or Republican or Tea Party or whatever over a\nUpstanding but legislatively on palatable Democrat I suspect\nRobin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive snowflakes\nAre they are completely ignorant of Langston which they distort truth to make their agenda seemed plausible there are so ignorant they can't see their own delusions and so delusional they can't see their own ignorance it's psychosis which requires a diagnosis hey look at ...\nI think Trump delusion disorder had gone further and become liberal or progressive delusion disorder there is no area in which they can see truth\nHuh Interesting thank\nYou so much for writing and yeah I Do think that there's a a mass hysteria and really a mass psychosis those overtaken the left Michael writes a high bucks it's short shouting regarding Elizabeth Warren here's some phone nicknames a liar walk the fraud is Zuma\nFake a jewelry or I guess instead of ... we're out of course Pocahontas and Pocahontas Michael well Michael your

... you're not hearing any criticism of Islam you're only hearing criticism of Saudi Arabia in this whole of this whole murder and\nThat's not by accident the left is very quick to criticize religion that is not Islam\nBut it's very fond of\nDefending Islam at every turn even even radical and more extreme interpretations of Islam\nA which is really where the problem was so there you go I'm Jen

bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was on about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the job\nWhich is now sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still with a lot of loans to the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if\nThe school provides a you know at the the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans\nUp but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of\nUh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available they get that discounted author student loan\nNovel huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an

somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will\nReceive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the ... then they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there\nPeople are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced\nTo uh to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWell that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hauled this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until you agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um that's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a

the power to declare war are raised in army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans they all fifty thousand now they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by

can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like\nUSA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living in a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhere do you recommend for a parent to use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy thousand dollars\nA year well I can guarantee ... per year\nThat's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible\nThe colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really string students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and that really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and in many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nThat's Ninety billion

buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that\nThat's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like\nBuying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with\nStudent loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so\nIs these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the lending system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy once once the tuition like Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the\nNumber I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I I should have pushed my kids and the sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and so it's you know\nUnless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid flying\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge good thank you\nI got good news for you man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they drop support sealed and he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it but\nUh anyway I I drive a little bit of trades will do a lot of work\nOr I got on the quality and when a company went under the under the conflicts and I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much going on there and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I ended up looking for the job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone is with us or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there what else do\nWell and I said well for a couple of years you know\nYou probably more and more experience than most people\nThere and I looked into the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go for oh I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're though way\nSo I ended up going unless the valves and dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi trucks and then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been talking\nA let's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think of trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sort of hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead\nOK I already knew the building and have positive but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is the ... I'm a conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost one out last forty three split decision in the shadow case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a sport right conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attack because it's money go into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax\nThat don't fill that role as a matter of fact\nThe price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military and it is too much really we spend a lot in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security\nBut we can only cut those things a little bit the on the third or fourth thing is probably\nThe tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it put the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and I hope he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much but\nListen I I and all of the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total that his college dead and and it's gonna crash the dollar that the only thing if we're going to get rid of that you want to let him get a credit card Idaho okay with loans but let them get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the state college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I look I lost my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here it can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look he can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich bank in these colleges can get the rates on student looking here ... that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and they use these are All right we all got your point there ...

E. R. dot com\nTen K. F. A. B. [noise]\n\n\nThan welcome back this is our final segment with that one call in just we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] or hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year\nOr so that money that gets taken away from home purchases a you know business formation a auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly is hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people\nA straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels directly to sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't other wise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy\nA and certainly those people will pay no taxes and and et cetera so\nSo it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Eleanor these scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas the first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHarvard George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nHuh that job thank you and hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a ... in the fall for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information as a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed\nA breakdown of all of the costs but I've heard and I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the video he tried to negotiate with these people every there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight now and first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy rates back so that they can't steal from is legally\nA but certainly don't deal with third and third party collection companies I'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the get alone no fault it you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a third party closing up like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public a clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are subcontractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting to the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate\nFind the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again well you\nHave to be very careful these are zombie loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nLeaders down the line least expect it\nThat's right yeah ... they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can fall you'd literally to the grave [noise]\nWhat you need to do is just say send me a copy of my own I'd be glad to talk with you and you know\nNinety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent strictly for loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shine\nFrom [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens and the Pentagon whole war what's that all of all\nTo

Seventy two expected with ... most accurate\nClose and I would say this wouldn't die if the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that\nOff to decades have to know the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive\nDefense intelligence agency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you know like you say for years they said no no since project we close down we haven't been doing this this knowing traffic or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try\nTo train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment both the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this but Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid told the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and hunting you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on the sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to a than a than a third one\nBut now with the public have been absolutely bombarded thinking yeah well there's the videos and then there's this rock stone guy and then this is a millionaire businessman and and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's\nThat's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course I denied it leans at the Pentagon but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seeds and and you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the ... said a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I've\nGot edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that but in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... oil from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... the thing so I scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording\nStudio ... you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right did\nThe whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way in that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along\nI but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFor mayor dates a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a\nA a great movie but um you know I I was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to talk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is\nIt we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go ahead on to the platforms that the young people you watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but to young people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since ... had his press conference\nWhere he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen they had a story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs\nCenter stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization um he\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said he'd always says in these sorts of\nSituations I eat as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't\nFrankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nFunding clog has been polled well Lu I was on both sides so ... doesn't matter you can continue a project\nWith you know using concurrent resources which is absolutely true um but you know it is it is a mystery what I Do suspect that's happened is if it is\nStill an extent program it was probably changed twinkles again this is typical government um alphabet soup\nTerritory we're not even a hundred percent sure about the name of of a tip Lou has said its advanced aerospace threat identification program a Pentagon press officer said one time it's advanced aviation\nA threat identification program and then we learned that\nA chip damned in part from another program called advanced aerospace weapon system application program so it's it's an absolute nightmare to try and\nFind out what the things even cold let alone whether it's still running and and you know that you're

that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty\nThat's weird well it it's interesting because um as we know that the the\nActual video streams to people from YouTube from different locations around the world if not all coming from one place but there are centralized system of course\nSo of the fact that this was a global outage suggests that there was some kind of access related problems centrally that caused this in my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I went to YouTube dot com or you'd normally get all those little thumbnail\nIt would just get the shadows with typically appear before the video thumbnail felt that was the it wasn't actually get the video\nSo uh it's an interesting kind of situation apparently uh there were people tracking where everyone when when they couldn't access YouTube but I guess one of the porn sites got a big spike spike\nIn activity there which I guess you'd expect some of the some of the other other sites to [noise] um but but it's an interesting kind of thing and I'm sure the post mortem the post mortem reviews that Google conducts of internal you're going to be are going to be pretty interesting\nUses a sign of the times Lauren when the Internet goes down\nIt well keep in mind you you too is a norm is I mean the scale of YouTube is is that\nWhat you do we got our own coast to coast YouTube channel I mean it's a big\nRight so the fact that it's large means that you know clearly this is one of those quote should be able to have a quote kind of problem\nOr the other hand as big as it is it is it the entire Internet it it is a very specialized kinds of applications [noise] so I don't think that's necessarily says anything about the Internet at large\nBut it does kind of make you remind it does remind you that there are central points that are potentially points of difficulty for the Internet they're designed to avoid large scale breakdown but for example if you have\nProblems with a DNS you could have difficulty numbers of people being affected and you always have to wear your belief systems you always have to think about those well just couldn't happen kinds of possibilities because sometimes they do\nSometimes they do indeed Lawrence thank you so much student loans now surpassed every other category of non housing consumer debt\nAnd continue to

job\nWhich is now sitting officially it about a one point five trillion hum but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still with a lot of loans to the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scams first of all you know if you go buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car

the the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [laughter]\nAh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of\nUh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that the students in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loan novel huh\nYeah that's a that's a
