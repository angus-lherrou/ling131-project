I don't think he told me what state you're from here but you know you got to get out there everybody votes please I don't want to be like one of these dumb celebrities like you've got to vote may cause it's cool\nNo but but please do vote especially if you live in a state where it matters matters everywhere but you know matters really at your for your congressman for sure for senator or I mean

definitely gives me a healthy love for freedom and our constitutional republic\nLately I think Republicans fears of felons voting is misplaced this is purely anecdotal but all the possible lip voters

that I think you will love hearing the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as a story is it's still not as scary in some respects to some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael dealing with Glenn joined us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd if you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunting to place in America\nAnd uh and when cameras captured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment and coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the fold right in the carousel\nOn the top of the website and coast to coast am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it because I Love to get back to this coming up\nLater on in the show wrote in\nDowntown Oregon City there are there it's just like at least that's the theory behind\nParanormal activity witnessed that five year old trees candidates dispensary\nBehold if you

that later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast to him to come and look at the video\nAnd then try to explain that coming up later on\nOkay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter]\nI understand that that's why I asked at a at\nA later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific come in\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she left to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she\nIs very good at it you know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic yeah there are a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear\nFor somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I at fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter]\nUh I've kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um\nWhat I ... in a sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um what Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there is\nThe ... as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... one of the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but [laughter]\nBut do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nA business is the really the new one of the new hot topics out their imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know ... it's pretty certain that we're going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which I'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection\nThat's that's even better but one of the one of the things that you know on mosques foreseen is a day when we're with the use the one of these ... that we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a\n... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the ... of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you have that in our own that you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will or thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon is so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nFall from grace from the one time global cycling icon who inspired millions of people after surviving cancer\nThat's your look back at

former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book is uh is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving a physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you and and uh I think in another concern a in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know ... and never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I Want to just pick that as an example\nThere is a good way in California right there's a company in California that is um marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policies so a lot of this technology that that are aimed at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality\nIs going to be available to the super rich and so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of a society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least if you will I'm\nAble to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the wave this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the song but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and\nYou know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind\nThis he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on it it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so\nMuch more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its\nGood side because God I did that this technology\nWe're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now\nIt can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I probably won't smoke\nYou write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall E N\nI mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just\nDoing computations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about or we want post about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button that up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what they call singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it I think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is was used in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an ice cube one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\n... are like that the cushy Murphy abs yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour

I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one no\nI I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's there's actually a movement called the trans human movement where as you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I\nBreak it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside I mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who\nHe was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life\nYou know of severely crippled and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we're mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you\nKnow these are these are arms that he can move with his thoughts so they're they're wired to his\nMind and I and I was amazed and fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now\nYou know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in even in the military setting\nI mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there you know where you know write it just it just it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing and he's soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe\nSome of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to [noise]\nAnd uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors in effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations\nAre thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know yeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we can't are just still the same you\nKnow all our faults in our foibles\nOur weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the euro opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that that's how they actually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ...

F. A. B. [noise]\n\nMichael before we start getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing the these women wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so\nThey downloaded the data from the fit fit and they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nSure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder\nBecause of this this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspects of our life that can tell you when you're asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate\nUh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but\nWe've invited it on ourselves than we are well these gadgets yeah and I liked\nA lot of them I mean I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a ... a law and order episode last week the same thing same\nTicket from the real life oh they do they always do yep no\nRipped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I\nI think that they like to catch a killer is one thing people listen to go oh good they kind of killer because of the ... the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system\nWhich accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face print\nRight uh that they've not you're not covering\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves to eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy right with which raises the possibility\nThat you and I got to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a\nSerious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse our summer camp as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jive with what's going on in science I just find that just\nIt's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot\nOf it will reach a point where we create\nAn artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot\nBut gets so complex and so the non ... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience\nThat you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying or from the crush souls\nOf the people in stumps on on you know getting on well you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a kid more elite dishwasher six so I'm not glued to that ... those exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with a I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve\nThem so keep that in mind let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast saying David\nGoing

there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how to use the supplies that are stored up in these codes or or whatever um\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are a latter day saints and so I just really be a

I'm more in line with the Quakers and I stayed with the idea of um the beginning of an age and\nIt's good for your age began disagreement about\nThat and really is is is that I'm going to determine oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or\nAnd this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that just otherwise it'd be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible because I looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it it sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years um because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those books when I'm familiar with a cover it right here I'm a good wanted a wrap it up quickly a lot of could go active I Wonder if um\nI I agree with and I kind of what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with different\nColor you I'm Talking about the liar along the lines of it your your creative freedom we have a we we all worship something you know what the money factor materialism or whether it's got him or herself um\nThat we really appreciate our freedom is that you should stay there for you to worship\nYour way I I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside as a as a sure\nI have an edge because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use ... oh yeah we have a voting rights act individually but can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is a I\nI don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about it the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona in or write or soon to be a a cans and isn't a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to we aren't philosophy should be where every education starch I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think\nThat's what we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the bladder but gosh darn it that was great thank you so much for jumping in an open lines and look forward to tomorrow night so the most elusive serial killer in history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nLet them make that decision I Want to think a George ...

think you will love hear the story of the men from the train or\nAs scary as a story is um it's still not as scary in some respects to some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen will join us just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd\nIf you go to the coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place in America\nAnd uh and when cameras\nCaptured ghosts all of those stories are in the news segment that coast to coast am dot com but there's also this other story on the top of the full right in the carousel\nOn the top of the website and coast to coast am dot com and that's this string of play a little bit of it here give me a heads up on it 'cause I'd love to get back to this coming up later on

later on but you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am to\nCome and look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me\nThere there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news\nFrom the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan\nMichael well uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh\nUh later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and\nShe's a she's a frequent guest year and they're very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she loves to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and was she talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very good at it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter]\nUh I've kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that are Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um [noise]\nWhat I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... ... it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic rope so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because\nIt really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of a you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut do we how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nOf it's just the really the new one of the new hot topics out there I imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with my ... and and then the very near future um you know ... it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman is that so you injected into the brain cavity of mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so\nOne of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosques foreseen is the day when when you were to use the one of these ... that we can actually surf the Internet\nWith our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you have that in our own that you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon is so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nMarketplace so a lot of products originated in North America and then shipped globally our culture in the company is phenomenal a big belief insurance except for the company what the employees there\nBut also big belief and giving back into communities where employees work and live we have a consistently put\nProfits aside each year to the score foundation were then we can support those in need we're consistently done that in our boys are very thoughtful as well to personally be active in give\nIn and the communities where they're they're working and living as well and it's honestly one of the most gratifying on things as the c._e._o. or to work with great people\nOf the great people who really care genuinely care and get involved and help out those in need in our community so many of our school employees do that I Would give a lot of credit to our modern day founder marshal bass a who believes and first of all give me back to the employees those who have made the company successful\nAs you do that you know the kind of that culture that is so strong spreads for those employees wanting to also give back to get back into communities and support those in
