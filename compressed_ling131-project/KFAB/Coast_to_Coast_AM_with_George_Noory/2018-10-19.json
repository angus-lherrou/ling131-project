announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs and industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nAnd why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible dial\nShore in fact China alone it expected to need an amount silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J.

doing it because they expect the price to go down\nThe hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced\nOr if you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe

seven with a ... most accurate\nAnd it's absolutely afraid to call in I'm very happy to her\nAnd that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from it's our life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath so the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals joys in many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question our connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me is that night and he said you know mom I'm fine\n[laughter] and I don't want you to worry\nAbout me and when I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go [noise] but they do\nHave a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nUh I I don't want people to think that two sides that right

sad yes don't do it [laughter] I\nKnow you asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have them ... ...\n... a feeling of this class sent you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel the presence or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSo if you're with the person who is not that good you would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I call psyche a\nVampire ... but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed in people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energy which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of healing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the ... billion year and then I just didn't want to ask you a question

evening to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding that there will be on the physical you know nine years old who do you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the medication\nYou're hallucinating or something the first person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my goal dissociation was an ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding is there a world beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army so moving all the time army brat situation not tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a big face\nBecome and sit on my that is a backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and\nOne day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you that invisible companion George was the older rub it younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wise itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into\nOther will we traveled a parallel worlds for example where we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as\nScience tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now it was a medic parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find out so for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from a relative in right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then and conscious elusive dreaming we made traveled\nThe places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survive physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold them going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my including cleared the love of family members are ancestors of spiritual guy some kind or another so\nDream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body and the brain we get into that whole field of non local mine but science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into\nThe ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes down will notice that they dream of events before they happen as one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is\nPlaying out in other realities and all the time periods\nIn the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to dust and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience as poppa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from mine experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use their story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect this to a deep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from the data and more objective perspective then we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done in minutes you get some help on the back of your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of the lead also the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between ... states have consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good

but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed some time ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\nA short of that that's still pretty prolific\nDo good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works that\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's\nAmazing what you can do a dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely does lifting some really interesting areas for example in terms of I\nMean one of the things going on in dreams of that that body chalk as well as social in other words in dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center\nThe idea is that a dream I gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing might be able to to avoid those symptoms but that's one of the functions of dreaming and and in terms of our emotional spiritual health I'll dreams which shows the things that help us\nYup well them to stay well and and it was acting up on those dreams of trying to bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people were United telepathy which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family well\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind Matt ... into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that at the heart of matter of reality is a dense conscious so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomenon\nBut used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know things that are going to happen before the\nThe mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body\nReacts to something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hits the gusher in my blood is boating and it's\nOn the line you live and pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen ... the white queen screams\nBefore she put her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks the thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly reported people think I was looted you well you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know the thing we know what the bleep we know that\nWe know enough about it you know so medic response was me pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nActed dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way you're going to take action that will empower your life and brings them healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also a method of loose dreaming you would call to shove medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of ...\nIt's a dream adventure is to start out loose or the state ... what does that need it means that we use shut medic drumming and the workshops\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay that's the romance an adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on the ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream you know another example is and I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that drift the tri state treating sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where\nWe are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like a ten to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the things will come to you the porch off elusive dreaming and finally\nActive dream you know the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open up and how to look to criticize the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams and self misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves to ever deceptive\nMean we can pick up things and the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't watch around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias that that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly are owed\nCan be worked in the service of health of healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on the ground you might find that behind something that's scaring\nWorrying you and your dream is a power power of understanding of how that might might give you all kinds of spiritual\nAlly or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the ... but a rush to interpret

because I Need to do more with the ones I've already got dreams require action\nThat actually does often writing something or making it out of electoral workshop I notice if I haven't been taken off

question and Mr moss would be concerning the shoulder why not bring forward to people get how brain and a massive painting dream you know like the shoulder can be in your wildest dreams\nThat instead of making a dry really bring the people what\nTraining can do it every day life so that whether it's you Mr marsh or Mr Joyce Keller really bringing us alive for the average person 'cause in causing I don't think many people really realize what dreams can do for them in their lives\nI couldn't agree with you more I mean this is what I Do this is what I'd do it in my books in my teaching I make it clear it found this is a road of limitless venture and exploration and discovery the multi dimensional universe\nI read my book the serious realities I think the last thing you'll be inclined to cool it is dry you might think it is too wild even though you're asking for wild because these are wild tales\nOf real travels into dreamland sort of real troubles in reality when by someone who
