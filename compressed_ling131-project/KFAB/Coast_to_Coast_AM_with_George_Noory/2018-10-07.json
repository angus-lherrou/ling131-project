[laughter] I guess you in the sense of the word\nHuh All right ah in order that you know this is not TV so in order that we might tell you a part if wasn't responding to something you would say this is Lynn or Joe or Paul you'd would be awfully helpful I think for the audience um\nSo what I'd like to let you guys do is sort of banter back and forth and what we must begin with is explaining to the audience um what remote viewing is who's good at doing that\nOh this is Joe ... okay I'd like to answer that if I could I'm In my opinion\nWhat remote what differentiates remote viewing for normal circuit functioning is the remote viewing is usually done with them a control protocol and a protocol is essentially been the same and has been on chains than some of the original a research and the remote viewing or Nineteen Seventy two Sri\nUh one of the things that dictates remote that dictates the protocol is that remote viewing is uh usually done blind with the subject and uh the there are specific requirements that go along with the protocol that are generally not violated\nA generally not violated all three of you have gone from the military Stargate Program into individual endeavors in civilian life have any of the three of you in any way significant or not modified the protocols are in your civilian endeavors\nUh this is Len let me answer that um [noise]\nWhen I was in the service or working there as database manager um [noise]\nThe NGOs one technique is a largely intuitive and ah and in several spots it's not at all logical and as a result of saying that uh\nMany many times when people will improve on it and watching the database each time I've seen the results go down um\nI have a kept as strictly as possible to the uh NGOs one technology now I've added a few things that\nTake the information and ah and expound upon it but as far as the excuse me as far as the basic uh\nA technology itself I wouldn't change it for the world\n[noise] uh this is Paul I'm it might be useful to to clarify something here um we're actually dealing with a couple of different approaches to remote and viewing\nUh Joe uses a one approach a linen I use another we learned ours are essentially for single swan uh it's called controlled remote viewing I used to be called coordinate remote Ewing Joe uses another a technique which\nI I don't know what he calls it we tended to call it back in the unit the E R B or extended remote Ewing a the goal of both approaches is to essentially control the process\nIn fact I I call it a central remote viewing in a very kind of flip way saying is is discipline ... in a way that you have a set of protocols as as a Joe's expressed which help\nOr exclude mental noise or help director focus your attention so that you you have a a far better chance that you would otherwise have getting specific information that is related to the target and you're trying to address\nAll right I take it in Stargate all the targets were of a military or national security or nature\nAll of the ... of this land all of the real world targets and the tasked\nWhere now we also had practice targets are that we use just to keep up proficiency and to um to try out new things and uh make sure that we didn't get rusty\nOkay kind of kind of like a the military out flying a out following a a seven twenty seven or seven forty sevens or over the Atlantic\nWell or you could say that actually the best thing we found to ever work with was a pictures cut out of National Geographic magazine's a sealed unarmed elopes and you describe what's what's in the picture describe what's at the site\nSo practice alright\nSure just like one of the things uh this is Joe I wanted to add something so that there's no confusion and the the listener's mind when we were discussing or when Paul and when and I were\nExplaining what it is we do or B. C. or beer or whatever you want to call it those are the the methodologies that each one of us uses to process the information which may may be different or who the thing I wanted to underscores the fact that for any of those methodologies to be considered a ballot for remote do they\nHave to be done within a specified protocol has to lose this different from the methodology so who's\nRight in fact this is Paul getting um him almost might make the analogy with a different email programs or you can use your door you can use pagan says to download your email ... um they're just different ways of organizing the data so to speak\nOn Al Pacino was born to play said you've got to lake house Billy Madison the shining second marry make ... and ...\nWho has your Halloween fix this month with movies like Wes Craven present day scary movie\nIn Texas Chainsaw massacre to the nightmare before Christmas wreck won three fourths of animal plus everyone's favorite killer dog ... and the original child play you can also catch the new season from years of Fox's animated shows like Bob's Burgers Family Guy Tana Simpsons now when it's thirty of the the\nAmazon Prime at more than two hundred title this month with movies like raging bull full metal jacket robocop one two and three and the David Lynch bill Mulholland Drive and maybe you can figure out what's going on this time to relive all seven seasons of growing pains on prime and watch the man in the high gas all season three which premieres on October sixth\nAnd that's new streaming edition and I heart radio\nThis week's top TV stream\nDuring a routine flights passengers as mine Tito air a twenty eight return home to find the world has aged five years I'm number five is the premier of NBC's new ways to size I fantasy manifest\nNerds rejoice as the big bang theory return for its twelfth season premiere episode on CBS his his show takes fourth place yet the tissues ready then says is that for a seat in three on NBC nine bucks to see them from the air and Lansing number three next\nIt's an Italian nice sights on the latest episode of the real housewives of Orange County you're number two shelves\nFinally highly welcomes her first baby on keeping up with the ... the perfect stormy episode is your number one TV screen that\nSays we stopped Eby streams are radio asking\nYour smart speaker for Nebraska news weather and traffic make sure you please and say play chaos a B on my heart rate [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nWe took you back to the pass on art bell somewhere in time\nThree gentlemen all involved in the U.S military\nIn project Stargate [noise]\nIn remote viewing project your tax dollars paid for all three now retired project declassified\nAnd they're talking [noise]\nWe'll get right back to the [noise]\nSinging rules for alerts and offers me automatic tax message Mr dean originally applied\nHello America this is Martha Stewart now you can cook great tasting dinners at home and it's easy to forget about frozen foods and take out and said joined me for great home cooked food introducing Martha him early spoon meal kittens repression fresh ingredients with my wonderful easy to follow recipes delivered right to your door\nAnd right now you can try three for free for a very limited time I'm offering three free Martha and Merle eastern meals to everyone anywhere imagine cooking butter based at stake\nBerkshire pork tenderloin she stuffed chicken and more with new recipes every week Martha andme early spoon helps you put a delicious dinner on your table and around thirty minutes\nFor three free meals and free shipping text young to two four six eight ten just kept the word yum to two four six eight ten for details hurry three free won't last long taxed yum to two four six eight ten\nMessages data ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's o F F E R to seven nine six four or five\nStar to your online MBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

Monica oh who even one time scored one hundred percent on ah I'm fifty two courage\nWhile I was very very impressed I should someday reached that did did you say one hundred percent uh there was one instance in the database where he got one hundred percent\nCorrect so it can be done\nOne one of the this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about the accuracy of [noise] I I've been working for over Thirteen Years with the cognitive science lab in California that that's the original founders of the original research and remote doing and\nUh we we've collected statistics on on dozens of remote yours or what I Would call world class promote the earth are generally speaking a\nOn an average a very good remote viewer can be expected to make contact with the target site about sixty sixty five percent of the time\nAnd out of the information they provide a the the accuracy of the information will run anywhere from thirty five to eighty eight percent now there there are times when the good remote viewer will get a hundred percent or near a hundred percent quality remote viewing but those are extremely rare\nAnd when someone establishes they're they're sort of history over a long period of time say tend to ah Nineteen years ah that that's the kind that percentage as you can expect\nAre those percentages increased with a team\nNo I'm from a research standpoint uh everything that we have in the database that we've looked at it the kind of the science lab would indicate that\nIf you had ten very expert remote yours all looking at the same party it as an example and an eight say one thing and to say another that it's just as likely that the two will be correct in the ... won't be\nAll right um our government at least according to the Nightline program that ran a finance Stargate over Twenty years with twenty million dollars or something like that\nAt the end of which are they more or less declared it to be a failure and stop the program um so you all three were in it was it a failure\nOh this is Paul uh no it was far from being a failure um\nIn fact I back last on active duty I wrote a review of the CIA report on that which I discussed many of the problems with that report or\nIt was a you know I it's hard to say for sure but it almost looked like it was consciously intended to to prove that the uh the program was faulty and yet they did not consider anywhere near all of the evidence available to to make that determination\nUh from my own experience and I think the other tool agree a while there were times when we fell flat on our faces they're\nUm there were times when we were unbelievably successful as well\nOr that kind of holds true of any of the uh various intelligence disciplines or none of them are a hundred percent uh none of them are even close to a hundred percent sometimes they're very successful and sometimes they're not so I Would I Would say we were at least as successful as into the other intelligence discipline and sometimes perhaps more so\nWell if that's true then uh the declaration that it was a failure was it wasn't intentional piece of disinformation or otherwise known as a lie\nWell perhaps you could say it that way you have to remember there's a lot more involved than just a bottom line as to whether it works or doesn't work there are a lot of\nOr remember it's not remote control it's remote influence understand right oh the\nUm go ahead and uh I Want to make one thing very clear by the way of keeping the database I kept all of the information on all the projects and at no time\nWas there ever an official task gain\nTo our unit are done by our unit or involving remote influencing anything that was done that was done by individuals on their own time and there was some experimentation and so forth but at no time where we ever task to do that\nWell would it be your view Lynn a unofficially that remote influencing is possible\nI Believe so I uh have collected the data and tried the experiments and have come to the conclusion that it's extremely possible\nMy God then you know I I again this brings me back to the military as a parent dismissal of this remote influencing would be of such intense interest to them or that it just seems impossible to me that they would not fully explore it\nWell if you're a politician funding something would you want to get caught funding remote influencing on\nMe or I don't\nThink any politician does and of course anytime you do something and government there's always the chance of a leak and somebody finding out\nBut then again they let it go death sure but they don't want to get caught selling missiles to Iran either well he did that threaten our government does lots of things that it it might not otherwise want to get caught at and the idea of being able to remotely in ... influence of Boris Yeltsin or or Saddam Hussein or any of the other big guys\nThis is Joe I'd like to comment on that from a science standpoint sure um I ... as I said before I I've been over Thirteen Years with their cognitive science lab and\nUh there there are a number of labs across America I'm there has been involved in remote doing research and many of those labs have tried some some experimentation in the remote influencing arena\nThere has been some some very interesting and provocative results which are still very much up in the air uh so if you were to say absolutely we can prove remote\nInfluencing you would have to say no we can't but if you said that there probably that there is a high probability that it's possible you would have to say yes but all the research isn't in yet\nThose are all based on that uh I don't know how you would actually apply it and uh be expected of a a a an ability to validate the outcome that's right\nI'm In the experimentation I've done a the experimentation I Know is completely full of holes and could be shut down by a\nYou know junior ... scientist and uh but uh I have done the experiment to my satisfaction are now believe that it can be done and quite easily oh but as far as proof\nI'm Still waiting for prove myself\n[noise] um our president has done from time to time over the last several years things that seem utterly uncharacteristic have any of you had anything to do with it\n[laughter] but I Do to them with my vote\nNo [laughter] All right I'm without naming anybody a\nWould one of you say Oh yes I definitely in my own mind I Believe that I definitely remotely influenced somebody's action\n[noise] yes uh this is what I was saying I Am convinced myself that it does work\nUh-huh um however let me again repeat that it was never official never official ...\nOne of the this is Joe or one of the problems here are is um when you start talking about remote influencing of other individuals and then you bring in uh integrity\nAnd uh yeah and that sort of thing as a ... ethics ... one of the problems that you become very heavily embroiled and especially within America and especially within research um is the fact that there are human use considerations that be taken into consideration\nAnd as soon as soon as you are\nSort of formally identify someone to participate in such an experiment you have to tell them front what's going on All right\nGentlemen hold tight uh we'll be right\nBack is premier network that was art bell hosting coast to coast am ... somewhere in

you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational during I got that he did one ... uh no he hung on for on for a number or um I haven't gone through the list but uh I'd say uh I saw at

[laughter] ah that's not an exact quote for what I said All right\nUm the claim was made a um buy at a dams that that he was the only\nPerson who who was qualified the trainer or teacher of the people remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote you're in a in the project and the only one who was a responsible your and my comment was that his primary job while he was with the unit was to\nTo act as a monitor and interface with the the viewer in terms of uh handling are setting up remote doings in that he was not a primary trainer he may have trained\nIn the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing and and that's OK that everybody had specific jobs within the unit\n'em and every one performed as they were required and\nI suspect that he perform you know righteously ended the job or very well [laughter] or or I have a problem is where he makes claims then then attributes them to himself when they're in fact don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with this any more today\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you not referred to it deems as Dr Doom\nOr this was a nickname that was

say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen\nThat would be with her socks and this is a A N and that's fine um well one of the remarkable things about remote\nDoing is that when you when you make a production or you make a statement about something a one would hope that there would be some validity or some method by which you could prove alluded to hear the rest of the information or I could\nCertainly choose or pick targets that are completely and verifiable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a opening yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense of ... um he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so call [laughter] yeah um and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out\nExcept a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more sitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic ability and names and said I accept\nI called the amazing Randy so called and asked him to come on he settled facts and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell add to come up with these numbers I said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that oh so how about coming on the program and setting up\nA structured test uh with the controls set up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program I'm do any of you feel that\nThe amazing Randy's challenge could be a taken and met\nA as it stands a he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind uh and if you if anyone does things on his terms oh\nHe wins I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate or\nDoing it on his terms you'd you'd uh\nYou'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick a you know that he uses for for his own a popularity and so forth\nOK buddy that yes but if if the controls were set up a independently uh from Mr Randy\nThen he wouldn't participate in the eye\nAnd so that's why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about that he he doesn't except the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs in the world and so he's not hardly going to come on your show art in in establishing\nA valid or reasonable protocol and allow someone to attempt to do the revolt doing\nSo I have the support it in in a in this because he he really hasn't been ... offered the opportunity to demonstrate under an appropriate protocol\nWell basically uh the amazing Randy wrote back to me and said I'm come on your program because I Can't be in the studio with you well either is it deems he's on the phone he said further CNN has made yourself and myself a an offer to\nDo a weekly program and it is true CNN has approached me and his approach Randy to do a kind of point counterpoint program\nAnd uh I feel it would it would watered down that program and so I don't want to come on your show all reasons that I considered unreasonable ah in terms of trying to set something up to to really meet this challenge I agree\nUh were where this is Joe um where where he essentially wants to hold all the marbles and and make all the rules\nUm that in itself a A N validation of a a truly scientific test a these things have to be open for discussion and venturing in an argument or in and they are so within a normal science so he he's actually violating the very rules that he says he has to stop what\nIs it possible gentleman to view a into the future or the past\nBut this is Paul huh yes as a matter of fact I'm a the past is easier to do a the futures a little bit harder\nOr but it it it it is it can be done it has been done a lot and and uh continues to be done and I suspect um\nMany of the training sites or we had at the old unit involved passed a law retro cognition and if you will of doing a events in the past and uh it worked very well it worked as well as real time\nWow ... one of the problem this is Joe and one of the problems you might you might run into in remote in the future\nIf you go out to many years you may you may in fact the one hundred percent correct remote viewing\nStart off in

had remote viewed Jesus was he on this earth was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nI'm this is Len yes Lynn a I had started a a an old war story here\nUh I had been doing the bad guys for for weeks and weeks and I went into the director and I said look just want to give my Mother Teresa are those are the clown or something these these targets are killing me [laughter]\nAnd the answer was a year soldiers suck it up to your job however a couple of days later I went in and uh the monitor took the seal down below up and said the\nTarget is a person uh I started the session and my first comment was whatever you think this guy did he didn't do it\nAnd uh uh as the session went on I just uh\nGot this below from from uh being in contact with this person and uh at the end of the session they monitor opened up the envelope and uh there was one word in the middle of the page and it said Jesus oh I didn't establish in that session\nWhether or not Jesus was the son of God\nOr or whatever but in that way I feel honored to have met the most holy person I've ever met in my entire life and one of the meeting of whom I think I think\nChange parts of my life um oh that that one session I think was was a turning point for certain parts of my life\n[noise] wow that's very significant um so you ... that there was such a person would you say that much\nOh yes uh-huh oh this is Joe I I Would support would lend just said oh I I have had the experience of a\nIf you could call a Jesus a target I have the experience of of doing some information that regard and likewise I have also had the experience with uh the other great profits as well uh Mohammed\nOn my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed\nThat's are generally so yes well here's Paul um the the biggest body of of material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves\nAnd the reason for that is not the connection with real remote viewing but the connection with other intelligence sources and means\nUm during his material on some of that some of those projects that would that that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability it might have disclosed the existence of some human source that we have you know and and a\nHuman outside I'm at risk or you know ... there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't even involved as we're all doing that that is sensitive to\nEnd are important to ah American security or would agree with that\nAren't you made a rather startling statement one of you or that it deems you felt disclosed some classified material before it's time uh well this is Lynn yes\nI'm not only on a on a few\nUh T. V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows\nBut also um I was down in Atlanta one time a working with the student and I had the chance to meet a person named uh Courtney brown ... who was going to put out a book or this book was about the Stargate project\nAnd he asked me to take a a copy of the manuscript that he had and read it\nAnd then the first chapter of the manuscript never remember everything was still classified highly classified\nI'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nOh I went back and I said I said Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh and uh you know if you do though they'll confiscate your book or something in in any way that got him to take that first chapter out mhm oh I ask him where did you get this information\nAnd he said well look at it from it\nOh\nWhen I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst\nTrees and that any agent could ever do\nWas give the names of the other agents or I mean you you you bite the sign a pill and die before you do that and yet here is the entire list uh\nFor the purpose of being published while this was still a a a classified thing now the reason that upset me so much was because um of another incident where it at a meeting\nHad gotten up and told what I had done a against Hussein and uh I called him on the phone and I should add\nThese are crazy people with guns and uh I've got a family here and he just blew it off well the only purpose I could find for giving those names to coordinate the publishing the book while it was still classified\nOh deals with the idea of targeting for remote viewing\nOr if you have a name basically you have an address and a the a history of Russian\nAu pair psychology has been more aimed at remote influencing than a remote viewing or data collection and uh I saw him I could still find no other reason\nFor giving that information to court and they then to have something happened to us and uh that upset me very much and uh uh I stayed around ... coordinate not only took the first chapter out\nBut also deleted it

before we leave the subject of aliens or dimensional beings or whatever it is that you all sins and agree or would be out there are one obvious target in this area I Would have been the Roswell episode\nAnd I've got a a person vaccine me from Los Angeles saying uh somebody must have tackled that one has anybody looked at Roswell in it so ... what have you determined\nUh I can I can respond to that first I guess this is Joe okay Joe I'm I I had a private client who actually targeted me against Roswell\nAnd uh at the time I of course was totally blind to the actual target and uh what I\nProduced was essentially a very accurate description of the location that was being targeted Roswell which is the believe crash site uh there were some indications that there probably was an incident there but it did not involve an alien craft\nIt involves a a possible ... collusion between uh uh some earth earth bound traffic and probably involved a some materials that were sensitive [noise]\nEnhance a then of course the story about the weather balloon\nYes I ... the data I had not specifically match a weather balloon but uh it it did indicate that there was probably and eat that

stage in which he sees creatures or ghosts free spirits\nAnd the person wants to know does everybody who remote views eventually get there\n[noise] uh in in regard to what what their referencing are uh some chapters and near where I was discussing a my interaction with what you might call entities\nThat uh took this took place essentially as an experience outside of remote doing All right I Want to make it very clear all while these these may have done a personal experience that I think is bell [noise] ah they they were not the separation was not obtained a piece of the remote\nFeeling um I\nI Believe it it's my personal belief a based on Nineteen years of participation in the project and in\nThe remote doing that I've done it's my personal belief that um that we are by nature are essential existing in two worlds a one foot physical and one foot in the spiritual\nAnd to ignore the experiences from a spiritual side would be taught them out to cutting off the left leg so to speak\nAll right ah here well then here's another good question other than the remote viewing of Christ um Kent any of\nYou or do any of you aside from your personal religious beliefs uh in in in the context of remote viewing or is it possible to confirm the fact that there is life beyond the physical\nI\nI I Will answer that uh this is Joe again\nI'm In my opinion yes oh\nBut it's not life as we know the physical and it's it's obviously something else right and uh I I Believe that uh we do have frequent interactions with or what might be termed as as entities or spiritual beans and that uh they had a profound impact on us as a spiritual\nSpiritual beings ourselves in that those types of experiences or had the because of the profound impact of them have exactly the same effect as if you were run over by a Mack\nTruck in the world so they should be paid attention to it and that's up to each individual as to what they do that\nAll right this is for all three of you are in the process of learning or a in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm\nI don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced myself or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous I Know there are claims out there to the contrary but uh\nUm you know I I just don't know where that is coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that uh uh would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] uh this\nIs land could I jump in here for a second\nGuess um [noise]\nFor each person when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are things that your subconscious and conscious of been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with\nA any real danger that comes to a person I think is basically\nCaused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring the danger that is then let loose um\nI have never had any are even actually known any person who has had a a a remote you in session where the session itself or the target itself\nA had a had a danger to the fewer oh\nI think what you carry into the learning process for remote viewing may be a danger to you but that dangerous been there all along anyway I'd ... I'd like to add something\nTo that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and uh Paula both said\nI've never had a bad experience and remote going but I Would like to underscore the fact that uh this is a very interesting uh experience remote doing or being psychic and there are a lot of people that are that are on the edge\nTo start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their construct or it can be very undermining or damaging to the psyche and uh there is evidence that a lot of people do sort of step off the edge and lose touch with\nReality in other words they become a pretty much in in a\nInvolved there are caught up in the the irrationality of it or the uh they lose their stability or their ability to deal a skeptically with the material and what's going on\nHow many of you while remote viewing or any target ... cents or a cell or understood there was not another remote viewer I'm In the area so to speak in other words it met another remote viewer\nAh yes oh I did on on several occasions made a a now let me preface this by saying that uh there was never any proof\nThat and several sessions did generally at random I met a Chinese remote viewer ow ow and are\nActually over a period of time of several meetings are sort of struck up a a very good relationship there however there's no proof of that I never got feedback on it because of course we never knew\nA or anything\nAbout the project or if there was a project or who the remote viewers were for China and so forth\n... would it be your view they are probably still a is still have a product of that sort either in China or Russia\nOh this is this is Joe I can respond to that\nI can say most and faculty that uh there are a number of countries Russia China\nHungry or a ... a number of other countries that are very heavily involved in pursuing remote viewing and ah researching it uh it would be silly to suspect that they weren't using it for a the obvious reasons that it can be used for ...\n[noise] uh then for that reason uh uh above all the others I've I've heard so far it again it's so hard to imagine that our own government would not do it knowing there are others out there doing it uh so if I had to make a guess I'd say we're still doing it but you guys they know\nAs an Eighteen year old when\nLet my mistake

does this mean that he didn't do what he did\nA letter that this is Joe I'm\nOne of the one of the normal procedures for for finding something else is to um to claim that uh someone else has already told you\nAnd then it's just a matter of elevating the information by getting it from someone else I'm this is a a pretty common ploy and it's used by the media representatives many times newspaper articles and things of that nature\nBecause someone else said it doesn't make a true and it certainly is no valid reason for violating a\nUh the oath that an officer makes or the security that someone is committed to in a dams case um I Would rather not comment directly on him [noise] but [noise] uh adults who is valid reason for what he may or may not have thought\nThat I I'd like to kind of when a little bit on as defense here um\nI think treasonous too strong a term here a treason implies that you're providing um\nDamaging information to unknown enemy or it didn't do that um he was you know in the various ah Venus and when she released whatever information he did um\nHe was in perhaps you know I don't know what his motivation was but he he didn't intend for that information necessarily to be used by an enemy or or or or someone who wish to harm the United states you know of course by releasing it publicly you lose control of that information\nAnd you don't know what you saw it will be put to that still doesn't constitute treason and\nLike oh let me ask you something or do you know of any country in the world that doesn't have a a open source literature a office I'm In San Marino has has little guy that sits in a building you know\nRight and and and you and and the point I made was once you've said that you don't know who's going to hear it\nBut in ... as part of the the definition of trees and if you intend to a release information to unknown enemy that's treason if you're just spinning it out or maybe that stupidity or maybe that's a lack of care or something else but it's not treason\nAlright in to be clear or none of you use the word treason treason was the word used to in in the facts or perhaps a reasonable interpretation or not reasonable of\nA of of the

when a for your information it's more of a thing as from Ron in Birmingham, Alabama\nAnd as a matter of fact no I haven't a part of the problem with what we're doing is you can't task yourself if you do then you're already asking for trouble off\nYou know you you know what the target is and you already have preconceived ideas about the target if you say oh I'm going to do remote you X then you're very likely to find that X what you expected to find whether or not is really their um even if I were interested in um you know going into the historical things and and the\nLooking at uh all the past historical events dealing with\nYou know my religion or any other religion um\nIf I were to test myself and the information wouldn't be valid\nYes you know it I can guarantee I keep up or if I have if I get inundated but I Do my best\nUh well uh you're going to be inundated believe me what projects or it in the remaining moments here what projects or have you all taken on after the military I take it you're leaving the national security stuff behind now are you probably had enough of that sink a ship\nA gift or maybe you're so you I don't know um uh but uh but so what are you doing now\nThis is Joe I'm I'm a research associate still with the cognitive science as well that was the original ... and then later as I say I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a\nUh some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research or all behind and we hope to continue a pursuing the mechanisms behind them up you\nCan you talk about it at all I I mean I Am for example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time I'm with national security work uh uh you know Congress and oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nOr we we of course it see a sellout are the kinds of Sciences lab has never endorsed uh espionage of any kind of were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports I function\nWe've recently done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have indicated that we may be on the something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and\nIf those prove out which we have every reason to believe they will ah there'll be some very astounding a findings that will uh open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier selves\n[laughter] every kind of scares me enough a high price I Am [noise]\nUh no longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed by it\nI Would agree with that\nOr\nIs it one of those things that once you have big gun uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was involved in the government program or otherwise who has said\nThis is lousy I'm I'm On board or I'm only interested am not doing it anymore is it one of those things that once you've done you will always do\nA this is Joe uh it's I I always tell people that if you are if you wanted me to sell my experience in this for ten million dollars I probably wouldn't do it [laughter] however\nIf you offered me ten million at the beginning to do it that I knew what I knew now I probably wouldn't participate\n[noise]\nUm I guess and yeah that's a good answer that's really a good answer All right well we're about out of time anybody a water issue any final words here um I of course would love to have you back at some future point um but any any final words for the American audience is intensely interested in this whole thing you've been doing\nMost of my call\nUm somebody else wants to say something too but um I I think there's a very exciting a process I think it's very exciting time to be involved in this and the\nAnd I'm Glad that people are interested that kind of in that case what we were doing in secret for so many years so I encourage people to develop an interest in it and to explore it and find out about it\nSo in other words go ahead folks if you're interested follow it\nThat's that's right Joe this joke I I just want to add one thing for you know after um I Would encourage people to retain or skepticism and to ask questions it's it's okay to challenge whoever's doing this in and have them explain are open\nTo review and criticism what exactly does that they're doing uh that's that's we're knowledge is developed and\nIt's how we decide whether something is truly valid or not so I Would encourage continued interest but to be skeptical and ask questions\nWell you know somebody might likely say and we've only got a few seconds All right I Want an instant demonstration you know arts holding up something tell us what it is that is not the kind of thing that remote viewing lends itself toward is it\nThat's the correct this is Joe I'm I I've actually done six live remote feelings on camera for national a national television and in\nOne in America and uh one of the requirements has been the established and follow very closely the protocols in in those performances have have an open to review and criticism\nAlright Joe ...

Nineteen Ninety seven news radio unlimited KF baby [noise]\n\nAll right well here's a question from Ross in California and it's a neat one uh please ask when if he has ever targeted the period of time in which the dinosaurs roamed earth\n[noise] uh not personally oh that\nIs a I'm a fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training of you know just as a as another uh a\nSession to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that well\nThere was a there is the second part to the question okay or if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nOr\nI don't remember specifically good in that I have always felt that a form of a man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from remote viewing I got that from other studies that have done a simple archaeological ...\nAnd then you know good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries\nAnd um before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California by saying Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't remote humorous [laughter] but you answer the way you want Lynn\nAll right we have ah people working on numbers which is a very hard thing to do and remote viewing a there is another type of remote viewing called alternate I mean I'm\nI'm a A R B a alternate remote viewing [noise] uh\nWhich uh substitutes remote viewing targets for the numbers oh and a allows you to a remote view for instance to pick three now the way the ... normally done is if you are doing to pick three\nYou have a four people working at a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view what if the numbers and one person who collect the data looks on the church to see what the results Maine and goes and places Tibet\nOff um but it it it's been done and uh\nOh it's been done successfully\nWell if remote influencing as possible how about sending ed McMahon and the gang up my driveway\n[laughter] or they're coming here first of all I see oh yeah I I understand that I really I Do a first time caller line you're on the air but Lind Buchanan hello is there a man you're on my name is John and I'm from Rochester New York Hi John\nAnd thank you Mr bell and or art I appreciate or your service you're providing\nA Lynne [noise] can you hear me [noise] yes uh-huh ah I\nI have a number of questions or is it possible that and the future that we will all be able to talk to each other and observe all of the information at the same time like a pentium to computer [laughter]\n[noise] uh [noise] excuse me uh I here's another place where I Would say I hope so I Hope that we can get to the point where we understand each other better\nWhere a quick good intentions are realized has good intentions and so forth I think it's possible and I oh I Know that there are many influences oh\nThat whole people back and I just hope that those influences aren't as strong as man's\nDesire to go forward [noise] one of the most frustrating things is that we hear all the information coming at us and that we can't interchange it as quickly as we wish to uh do you know anything about Jane Roberts\nOh say glee mhm\nUh and also another question or a Frank corporate wrote a book called doing and the the threads that mile deep was seen as far as the future was concerned right mhm it is our future and threads as he kind of alluded to\nOh that's a good question\nUh let me uh oh refresh my memory unless it's been a long time since I read doing uh uh the threads mean ... there's another side are\nOr I Would presume if she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest to address to remember is art bell dot com and a ... there's a link to my page and on my pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with a computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time we are heavily backed up with a sign witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so um\nOh I Hope people won't be offended if um you know if they call and uh have their\nDepartment call as well and uh nothing is done that day ah we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable a west or the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nAri yes\nGood morning my credit for that kind of lost track all scared to cover up a fake like All right\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nExactly are absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote you and is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and\nThere is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat oh if ah someone else whom you respect very much\nA does a session on a target and they're wrong out of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm oh\nAsk the same exact question to two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to it deems a tapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be a sort of virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat's my fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote you correctly\nThe more who learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn encourage excuse me incorrectly ...\nAnd this is my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there oh that I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder to pick just a you know the hundred monkey a Fisher a just a\nAlmost destroyed any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah what what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released to the very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen more coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a one of the sun has to be up back there huh\nYes and looking at the one who it is a huh\nAll right my friend while I I suspect you're going to have a lot of emails to answer and uh this will keep you busy for a while has been a distinct pleasure Lynn and we will do it again one day if\nI really enjoyed it uh

for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir and new things like that but I'm but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I tried to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly to answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like ... if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking to go again\nAll right you know it's like they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool I there

friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give\nYou one quick example I was in Newfoundland about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because uh there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are and they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak citing up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing this thing as you enter the town the town of the population is like three or four or something\n[laughter] I rented a car

is here discussing the origins of Halloween on ... talking with Ben Radford then sell as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's the only sign with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that that can do that any time of the year\nYou know the Seine creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman masking make make them out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and play a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although you know Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it wasn't kid centered as it is today\nA it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to win and the the the early a Celtic versions of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that\nUm but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was a to honor that the church a church members will have to have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole day which is November second which bills were wrong for the phone purgatory\nAnd so there was this there were it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nUm um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things you know sold day\nAnd and again they were the ringing a bell and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise we're such a scare away the evil [noise]\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAh and then it came over with the with the first and second waves of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the witch trials may have clean they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years in a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know point though her right\nYou'd actually have families coming together to make a gift costume ... and what you find is that\nThe first um the ... the first record that I found up Halloween masks are really emerging about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as a marketing is turned Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we now basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied or something like can you really continue to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well ah an essay question you know I think that um you know ... ...\n... as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed for I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we're with each\n... each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like\nScary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any or of any faith and creed hum ... who does like to dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors national for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a ghost you know where you've\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that because if he had he was like this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to a asking about this the Pentagon part of it when we come back stay with it you are listening because because I Am I'm tiny Willis and really we tonight\n\nNever missed a detail or shura gets sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to be in the new view streaming it is it's a new month which means a new list of streaming\nBut he's that'll keep you from raking leaves Netflix has adding the much anticipated second part of making a murderer on October Nineteen as well as seasons we have daredevil the hip\nHop evolution season to that same day Ron White new comedy special titled if you quit listening I'll shut up drops in the deep end that places for Marian new music documentary series called re mastered the first special focuses on reggae icon Bob Marley called who shot the share of the movies I had to get through this down John with a never ending story he's\nBig adventure Robin to print the feed blessed with like the devil's advocate on Al Pacino was born to play statements you got to lake house Billy Madison the shining that can marry make for them and law\nSchool who has your Halloween fix this month with movies like Wes Craven present day scary movie Texas Chainsaw massacre to the nightmare before\nChristmas rack one through four is available plus everyone's favorite killer dogs ... and the original child play you can also catch new things that premieres of Fox's animated shows like Bob's Burgers Family Guy ... now and it's thirty of the the\nAmazon Prime at more than two hundred titled this month with movies like raging bull full metal jacket robocop one two and three and David Lynch bill Mulholland Drive maybe you can figure out what's going on it's time to relive all seven of them growing pains on prime and watch the man in the high gas all season three which premieres on October thick and\nThat and they wouldn't be screaming edition and I heart radio\nMan who are card night [noise] [noise] ...

controversial stories of the day\nRadio eleventh says\nThey be [noise]\n\nKind of you will hear on the coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think he has he didn't like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of ghost tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted house you know reached out and grabs her grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they ... if if he drinks on when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the paid here what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nUm and and again you know the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is twenty two Eighteen you know thou shalt not suffer which to live\nOn and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons I'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and\nAnd ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it if it\nWeren't you board or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so concerned that using a ... I was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat's when because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... that a kid the dresses up as a witch or a goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so they they the the\nThey make a case to distinguish it from Holly this is not always as a harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights in the\nAh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations that ... W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and it got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to ... just the way it was right down the marathon\nBars on either right away I Am\nDoing those [laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had um frozen ... they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written or something yeah\nAnd the ruler on the back\nOh man I Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was lost USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nNever on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now\nSo well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff\nAnd now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street that nobody ... the abandoned homes or\nA ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside these places and they use the energy board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you have written quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I just ... and that's why I like to talk\nOf her life I'll just say that all admit that I liked your\nLet your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences of now I think I found it interesting that you had said to me\nThat people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would go ... why would you want to talk to a stranger\nYou know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know and that's true why do you now\nKnow that was that was ... when things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those it's basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the good um ranging from basically pre history\nA but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lady Macbeth I mean banquet so there's there's there there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history\nBut you know typically go or or if it's typically if you if you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to\nSay they're rock and roll lovers and Sandy ... take a trip back to this week in rock and roll history start off at Nineteen Seventy eight where the members of Aerosmith bailed thirty bands out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during an Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum softly and I tell them\nThis week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather\nThe tax by a man who hit them from behind a repeat the phrasing Kenneth what is the frequency prompting R.

T.\nRadio of living to live in a way of a B [noise]\n\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring him back on year being we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in to an area where somebody says there's these things happening\nAnd I want an here's a question that I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is his picture I took ... you know some there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to say things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you know what is photoshopped what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... what might be a maybe a light reflecting off\nOr the difference between an orbit and a piece of dust how the analyzing of photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that that's a good question I I have to say that that um\nYou know I've I've probably looked at two or three hundred and photographs or over the years that people were sent me I'm I'm the same with the ... on the on the default recipient of\nOf ... [laughter]\nActually mean dogs in Texas but I I have to clean up to them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the ghost photo of them sent\nIt was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and trees that the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spears there that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is problematic for ghost research right because\nGoes can't be both in her dimensional spirits\nAnd you know an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know for the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena that has such a widely disparate range of explanations\nThat's a problem so I I don't know what goes are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spiritual the debt that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for widows for Willis ... thank you for getting the\nInformation you have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but are coming up we're going to be talking the werewolf in

depth research about what to wear well because I'm\nI'm not here tonight to subscribe to the idea to like come through however I Do believe some thing exists something very real otherwise you know to be unreported income for over a period of hundreds of years you know sort of throw the through the ages in fact I mean [noise]\nIt is today in your piece of where they where the story originates from Coney which is the ... stock which is probably\nThe most important archaeological sites in Britain and one of the most important sites in the world uh you know some of your listeners may not have even heard of it but it's worth worth researching I'm stuck out his is mentally fit middle stone age and just give you a break for outline of the at oh yeah absolutely\nIt's it's a it's a it's an archaeological site dating back to nine thousand face say say middle stone age just after the ice age people federal and these people were just home together that they actually settled on flicks them stuck or\nA it is now the lake he's gone now we've got ... to be honest with the cows run across stock or you can in some places you can feel the ground reverberate because he's so ... ... ... and\nThe people I mean there's the evidence of the first house home ever built\nIt by the Israeli settlers in the U.

mumble they believe that these people or shame on them they practice the ship but I practice [noise]\nUh no I'm not saying that is the reason we have the stories of the flexed and well what is interesting that when you're sort of cast your mind too often transformation into other animals you know the base of the store to comb through\nFrom these people I mean I think we have to consider these things as I say I don't particularly think as a person running around in ... um how\nI'm One hundred percent believe that the people who've come forward and told me the stories of the ...\nAre telling the truth I mean if you like a refuge was built county and the tenth century I took place called spiritual Kona inflicts than it was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that poll is made up\nA and the king was ... and he ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge undeniable is a fabulous name what's called a home so he built his refuge to protect troubled travelers from an infestation of Savage based\nAt the scene like\nYeah it's fabulous some spots where the name spittle hospital comes from the news was built to that's why they call it spits O'Connor or at least they be devoured I\nI was lucky enough to contact the people in our own what what is now the ... in ... after they've been stopped safe to being a refugee hundreds of years ago because they supposed to nine fifty seven so this refuge was built so we're going back a long way obviously not far back as the early settlers of stock or\nA bill ... but it was due to protect travelers from an infestation of Savage bees\nLeast they be devoured said now I look to that dates and the ... some of the days of them ... and that's what it\nSays on the wrist documentation on the line that you'll find that says this we we must also not forget Coney that you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent in the u._k. and bad so\nYou know ... we're not necessarily to an entirely talking about the ... the ... the stories that are quite incredible because when you look at the line and you and you're going to the research you discovered the flakes than\nWas once called ... which is interesting and I it's now ... old ... on old maps those areas afflicts then depicted as well and\nAnd just a few ... somebody changed the name ... to make it like like maybe the\nSeems safer or something or they didn't want people to think of the old miss maybe or you know why would someone changed the name I mean that you know I'm like ooh there's a reason why it was a name that\nYeah well there's a reason and we'd go connotations to the world for you know in any case it is true with proper research this that can be sort of back to pre\nIf anyone else wanted to look

before you do though um and that is interesting about your batteries 'em before you go into it a tell tell us the names of your books\nOh okay yeah well the first one is true true true but leaves no proof of\nMonitor when I explained phenomena or the second one is truth proved to be on the thinking behind\nThe third one is just about ready to be published and a stop to the full well that was actually stop it before the new ... case arose in twenty Seventeen to twenty eight the honorable mutilation is it's a place called them and I just know I just leave it\nAnd people and continue with another truth prove book or the strange things that are happening upon on the area of coastal quite unbelievable and we were doing a small film called the the ... to phenomena which can be found\nIf he wants to look on line and crushed to another filmmakers ... releasing a film dog mine relates a big ... related called elusive which is going to be quite incredible but you know for me I\nHe said and the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just let him that he said wait expects a horse to London move forward because the momentum this thing just landed and stuff like a magnet\nSudden something not to look at that\nHe said it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he led them before you run away he said but he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it's still do consider being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder he said he no he said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd ... and he said he was almost sort of Britain's gulag you know like a box that dog all the stuff with you about terriers\nAnd that what he ... he says well he said I went to the edge to them to try and get sentenced Dave it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered\nCrossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible um you know that's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county\nAnd if you if you go further down the coast to watch a whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bombs to drain the featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd this was such a supposed to be aware of that was such a going the bomb syndromes into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and if you go for the the coast you've got\nOld folklore legends old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven Scott ... way to reach in the ...\nAnd you know the story is after they've come down the behind the down in time ... there's there's I think those grains of truth in the stories\nSo that was a side thing in the Nineteen seventies and lived in Britain do all his life and he's never seen it since he's never seen it\nBefore that and they'd never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story but if this thing was native to that Saturday you would think there'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it coming\nKnow made yeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in the top down along the way kind of like\nWhen I talked to people before we had a friend of mine Laurie Williams removed you are in I Would have heard target and and she she mentioned how they they are actually didn't\nBut what it was you know she is looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they have these portals\nAnd they were and time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know in ... where whereas human would see him um I find I find it also interesting\nUh when you were saying that R. E.

I'm strange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that I don't know I don't know\nYou all know the story [laughter] we'll\nJust wing continues here on coast to coast am I'm Connie Willis and we've got Paul Sinclair is our guest we're going to talk more about the ... where Wolff and other things too that are creepy in the night [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nHi I'm ...

X. files department but I'm not basically\nYou know I I work for a nonprofit education organization called the center for inquiry based in Buffalo\nAnd for them I'm the editor of uh magazines coupling choir and do things like that but I Am but even aside from that I just love mysteries um and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go to go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a\nCritical thinking folklore point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like ... if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at ghosts again all\nRight you know they're like we're going to the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool idea there is a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so\nThat that's that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation when I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just is what it is you just can't help it\nIn your mind that's what she did you and if you weren't that'd be hanging out there within you would just be dying\nLiterally I can relax a little bit the despite you know despite\nWhat my friends and tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because there's been a series of lobsters are the have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are and they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak signing up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know a Newfoundland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing this thing as you enter the town the town is the populations like three or four or something\n[laughter] I rented a car I'm like I put on the break but I got to the I I\nCan't pass a lick monster come on site and you know my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter]
