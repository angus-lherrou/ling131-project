recognized certified financial planner professional\nAndy Smith just a few moments anti will get deep into this week's portfolio review first Scott's calling from Kentucky is eight eight eight eight three three eight six three seven and here's a question\nAbout a large stock position in his four oh one K. Scott thanks for calling fire away what's your question\nSo I worked at a company for Twenty years ago for one still was a it it's through fertility and it's about four hundred\nThousand dollars and a lot of drivers title you're competing stock I Would like to bring that from Fidel on my current uh but somebody mentioned something about the audio penalty because of the stock and movie that I don't quite understand\nThat Scott there should not be a penalty but you probably won't be able to transfer the stock from your old employer to your new employer\nSo I don't want to have this years I'd like to sell off this year okay pretty good price right now so I Would like to take the lump sum yup but I'm not sure so first of all there's no penalty then what would you suggest I go to what this four thousand\nSo let's talk location first you can sell the stock take that four hundred grand from the old plan then move it to the new four oh one K. or you could move that money into something called a roll over IRA with both of those you know we're just dealing with account type\nNow regarding asset allocation\nAnd that's just the investments that you're going to buy with the money right stocks bonds cash within the roll over IRA you openness on an open platform like swab\nAnd you know theoretically the sky's the limit thousands of stocks bonds mutual funds ATS all at your disposal but if you move the money into your new for all and K plan\nYou'll likely see much more limited selection of funds or institutional holdings\nThe thing is some plans give you access to a lot\nBut others you only see a handful of investment options\nGreat thank you so much man have a good weekend you're too\nWhen you think about it you know folks who change jobs pretty often it's so easy to lose track of old for one caves and I'm guessing that there was a pretty good number of Americans that have for one case that are not being attended\nOh absolutely it's a common situation and it could end up being a huge issue\nAnd for investors down the road if you can relate if you could use some help simplifying consolidating investing your savings get over to investing sense dot com start talking with our local team\nSo let's go back to Scott's situation and talk about holding a large position in the stock of a company that you worked for within a four one Kay says status through those considerations\nWhen my clients hold large positions in their employer stock it's usually a pretty emotional situation yes it's normal yes it's a human reaction but\nI see this attachment to the stock like they do not see with any of their holding\nNow these emotions can sometimes make it kind of difficult to objectively analyze the risk and the risk has to do with holding a highly concentrated position in one lone stock or even more and ... and really importantly you've got to take into account where you are in life\nDo you really want to risk most of your retirement success on the performance an outcome success or failure of one lone investment there's a just a huge risk here in the situation\nWell and I can hear some people asking well wait a second the risk and holding a concentrated position in stock and go both ways there's the potential for a high reward or return but they just like you mentioned there is also the potential for big big risk\nOh yeah and you know here's two examples let's say you work for Apple you hold a large position in a ... out in your four one K. it's done great over the last few years and you've been rewarded for taking that risk\nBut now consider two former American blue chip stocks got General Electric and Sears won a famous industrial giants or the other one of the most iconic retail brains in this country if you worked at either of these companies and all you own was concentrated position in that company stock\nThe risk is that you would not have been able to retire because if all you own was G. E. or essay Jody you probably would have lost a ton of money in your four one K.\nAnd by the way the broader stock market has been in a bull market for more than nine years and that means an index fund would have been a much better place than either of these two stocks over that same period of time\nOr lighting your money on fire would have been a much better Israel kind of outcome you know worst case scenario is that your stock goes to zero\nAnd even though this doesn't happen very often it can happen I mean remember names like leeman ah WorldCom Enron these companies had employees who held lots of company stock and for one case they loved it when the stock went up but what do you think happened\nWhen that didn't yeah it just went down to zero zero\nOkay and the only defense against this company specific risk is diversification and we build this into all of our clients personalized plans if you could use some help get some help get over to investing sense dot com and and start talking with our local team\nWell that brings us to this week's portfolio review and a quick reminder please consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor in your area by going to investing sense dot com now in future shows if you would like to have Andy review your portfolio here during the show\nAsk Andy at investing sense dot com is the email right portfolio review in the subject line but it's pretty easy ask\nAny at investing sense dot com so\nJackie said to her portfolio last week and she writes I have a question regarding bond funds and CDs\nWhich is better at this point bond funds seemed destined to lose value in a rising interest rate environment individual bonds pay the state of interest rate it helps the majority but Kerry default risk CDs pay the stated rate it held the maturity and our FDIC insured\nSo this is where the conversation started with Jackie but I wanted to dig a little bit deeper so I ask more about the overall situation\nBecause look planning an income stream and retirement is difficult enough to begin with but now you got rates where they are where they could be later on the market in the environment or going to get even more difficult and Bob you have you have Jackie's reply\nDo she wrote back I'm retired sixty seven have a pension and drawing Social Security my spouse is also retired and draws Social Security combined we have about a hundred thousand dollars in annual income from those sources and saving a portion so we don't eat into our savings\nYeah right there okay it's a key point that I Want to you know for those kind of you know the focus on here they are still saving a portion of their retirement income stream\nNow I'm going to circle back to that and the second Jackie may not have realized it but she revealed to me of a little bit of risk aversion by mentioning these CDs\nSo in our email conversation I suggested some alternatives and realize you know we use any or all of the following types of bonds in clients' portfolios\nOr you've got high yield bond flowing rate bonds municipal bonds corporate bonds multi sector bond fund or you know collective investments so importantly right now we're trying to keep the duration pretty short or even ultra short\nAnd because we think this is one way to manage interest rate risk and still get the potential benefit of a steady income\nSo let's go back to the key points about Social Security and pension income\nJackie said that they are in about a hundred grand a year between Social Security and a couple of pensions right plus they're able to save a portion of that cash flow each month in other words you know they can let their savings ride that this is this is very important in this era of longevity that we're seeing right now\nUh you know when you understand that you're likely to have a much longer life in retirement you start to realize pretty quick you know how vital it is to have your savings and investments work for you for longer\nSo with Jackie I was able to carve out an application to some different bond funds inside their overall portfolio and their their income sources\nAnd it was an allegation that made sense for their uh situation for their longer time and retirement while still trying to manage risk against that rising interest rate environment if you could use some help planning your retirement income stream like this get over to investing sense", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "06"}
