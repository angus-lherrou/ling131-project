we see coming here the rest of the year and then twenty Nineteen and now the thing about the evidence is this evidence or great until they're not there anymore and just because the company's paying

to the financial engines investing sets with Bob Richards a nationally recognized certified financial planner professional\nAndy Smith with just a couple of minutes away from this week's portfolio review first we have a question from who's calling from Massachusetts hello any\nLaw so my question is forty eight years old um my husband\nAnd I make seven thousand dollars a year I only have about eight thousand tonight L. I. R. A. and I would like to I Want\nTo put on weight by Kelly I mean even when I looked at it like question\nOkay great question um so you know kind of the easy answer is I usually tell people save as much as you can for as long as you can\nAnd so kind of on top of that then you said All right so if you're forty eight you want to work until you're Seventy you've got about twenty two years and so that's a good amount of time to get a fair amount of money uh\nYou know socked away or inside the raw Bahrain here's what you can keep in mind so with your Ross IRA um and then you know the same could go for your husband as well so with your author raise each of you can contribute\nUp to fifty five hundred dollars a year\nBefore your age fifty but me and me before you turn fifty so you're forty\nIt how old is your husband do it six\nOkay so each of you can contribute fifty five hundred dollars a year now once you turn fifty you can actually save you can save an additional thousand so you can save sixty five hundred dollars a year when I\nWhen we know when you're fifty so here in a couple of years you can start saving sixty five hundred so what I Would do is just kind of have in your mind you know for these next however many years however longer working you plan on saving\nFifty five hundred dollars a year before age fifty and then sixty five hundred dollars a year for that twenty year period of time between age fifty in Seventy now\nWhen you when you retire so you want to work until you're Seventy [noise] the other thing I Want\nTo do that but at this point choice because I thought\nOkay you know and I would say that you know I'm you've you've got the savings you're going to be working one of the things that we found that that is most helpful for people's um you know to to help them find success with their retirement is just working longer\nSo the fact that you want to work until I Seventy yeah might not be the thing that you thought was going to be the best thing in the whole world but it really is going to help you because the longer you work\nThe the less you have to pull from your investments or you don't have to claim Social Security uh you know for a you know for anything for that so when you retire at Seventy you're going to have Social Security and then you're going to have your investments to live off\nOf um do you have any debt right now no tail that\nPerfect All right so no debt um any other short term cash need that you see here in the next twelve to twenty four months\nOkay I I don't want a house\nI'm going to face Fifteen fucking and it a try now okay so I feel like I'm Still on our house it for my mortgage I find it out on a fucking run it out I I'm not saying\nOK I'm putting money away for something a\nPerfect perfect and if you're paying you know fourteen Fifteen hundred dollars a month in rent now the mortgage earlier was less than that you you can that's just budgeting um when that when that comes into play and so really what I Would have you do right now is you know for twenty two years\nOr however long it is you know that you're going to be a working you know plan on saving that fifty five hundred bucks we're sixty five hundred bucks into that Ross IRA now or do you have access to email\nOkay um when you are in a position to us send me some more information about the Ross I can put some more ideas into an email for you just send me an email to ask Andy\nAt investing cents dot com but the the things that take away from the call right now you're going to save fifty five hundred or sixty five hundred will get your squared away with some different investing ideas for those Roth accounts\nAnd then passed that every three months or six months or so give me a call ... ... email will kind of get your squared away for the next couple of of quarters\nAnd really will just kind of approach it from there once you get to you know maybe fifty five age sixty then we can start looking at um what you might need to be doing with Social Security which your retirement income plan will be um\nYou know how health care will be paid for all of that stuff but I'd say right now just saved send me emails to ask Andy and investing sense dot com and and we'll get your set here for the rest of the year I\nIs how much Iran fishing\nUh any I appreciate you I appreciate you giving us a call ... have a good one okay\nIt that they go by\nNow it is time to get into this week's portfolio review and as a reminder please consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor in your area by going to invest in a sense dot com now if you would like candy to review your portfolio on a future show\nSend me an email ask Andy at investing sense dot com right portfolio reviewing the subject line um but really just get me that email ask Andy at investing sense dot com\nAnd this week's portfolio was sent to us from Henry and Henry writes\nI all of my retirement money at the bank in an IRA CD I'm sixty eight and a half and still working and I don't have any plans to retire I've been collecting Social Security for a few years and I just put the money in savings even if I wasn't working I could be about the same financially\nWhat if any other suggestions would you have for me\nWell first of all I'm really glad that you reached out here a Henry ... we talk a lot about risk on investing sense and a lot of times it's from the perspective of a the potential of losing money okay but you might actually be exposing your heart and savings to some overlooked risks\nAre namely longevity and inflation K but set set those aside here for for a moment I think what this comes down to is that you might not be taking enough risk with these with these saving\nWell Henry wrote that he's sixty eight and still working and then said I don't have any plans to retire that's a lot different than other sixty eight year olds and it sounds like that those are a couple of signs that he may be in good health and and could live for a good while longer\nRight so and he sounds like a hardworking guy right uh yeah so Henry I might actually have you think about getting your money to work a little bit harder for you or you've got these dual income sources sounds like you're in a pretty good financial position\nUm you know I might have you consider a portfolio that's a little bit more balanced I fifty percent stock fifty percent bond because\nYou know you're you're not taking any risk with your ear you think that you're not taking any risk with your savings but you're forgetting about inflation and how those could eat into your CD returns so then all of a sudden there's this solid risk that your CD returns are going to be falling short of of what you need and putting you in a position where you could\nA lot of money and I I I went ahead and logged on to the bank right dot com and I'm looking at the CD a returns right now here's what I'm seeing the national average for a one year CDs two point four percent or the average return for a three year CD\nTwo point four seven percent and the national average for a five year CD to point seven three percent so that that gives you an idea of where CD rates are so what about the historical rates for the return of the fifty fifty stock bond portfolio that you just mentioned\nRight so vanguard studied this fifty fifty portfolio fifty percent stocks which ... percent bond and it went back and they looked at its historical performance going all the way back to Nineteen twenty six so here's what they found the average annual return was eight point four percent are the best year was in Nineteen thirty three\nPortfolio returns thirty two percent\nThe worst year was in Nineteen thirty one when the portfolio last twenty two percent but since Nineteen twenty six this portfolio has had Seventeen losing years right sounds kind of lousy but if you step back and think about that that means since Nineteen twenty six\nThis fifty fifty portfolio stocks bonds it's been profitable on a yearly basis", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "13"}
