advice tax advice financial advice to you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy we're not going to lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million ... taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start going out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced they end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say on the kid growing in my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone you're going to be a pariah so if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely will you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to\nSatisfy what they believe is how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to uh extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich people were me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible because you need personal security and when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute\nHow much money you're going to give your mom you just netted after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give them a million bucks you cheap little sun come on you're going to give her\nTen million you just got Ninety two million dollars how much given your mom how much is given your dad\nHow much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars guess what you didn't\nGive away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars you know my friend not them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for that ain't going to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five\nYears I'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars guess what you'll have won the lottery\nOf course past performance was known the kitchen of future results any especially in the country as a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise] I didn't buy a lottery ticket because as I often say to friends and family\nWell okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one\nSo the larger glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you win the lottery on Tuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that they're not only did you get rich you got a little poorer because of the stock markets performance and we're going to talk about the stock market\nAnd what it means for your investments in what you should do about your investments strategy as a result of the new volatility that we're experiencing

we're now broadcasting this program to eighty five radio stations across the country\nOr this program as the longest running national personal finance radio show in the nation are talkers magazine has

listening to the Rick idleman show for the first time\nAnd uh we're going to be talking about the stock market right now and and the reason that this is such a a big deal conversation\nA is because you've got money invested and that's what we do for a living a at our organization uh we manage a lot of money for a lot of folks all across the country a bearing says ranked hour from the number one independent investment advisory firm in the nation\nAre and we're very honored by the barons ranking and we want to share with you the advice and information that we provide to our own clients and I'm sure you've been acutely aware of what's been going on in the stock market this past week\nVolatility has returned\nA and although the numbers look rather shocking you know what the Dow Jones industrial average on Wednesday\nDropping over six hundred points uh that's nothing compared to the fact that the Dow was at twenty five thousand before the drop occurred and that's really the key point isn't it that we can't be focusing on the point drop\nWe have to look at the percentage drop\nBecause we put it in that kind of a context on a percentage basis the drop really wasn't newsworthy wasn't all that material but regardless of that we do have to acknowledge the facts and the fact is that as a result of the volatility this week\nYear today the Dow Jones industrial average is down one percent the S. and P. five hundred stock index is down one percent\nShelter for domestic violence or whatever that reason is who cares if somebody that's seeking their basic needs that we need to make room for hand we serve a lot of meals and you know that I have a nice young Lee is a lot more fun to care potatoes and cook then ... them and we even like to clean up\n[laughter] and it's like how much\nBetter in our kitchen than your own when you're sending someone else because grateful someone who's ... and we actually surf anywhere from Twenty one hundred twenty seven hundred meals a day and Ninety percent of refugees can eat it we have a fourteen thousand square foot gardening and a greenhouse what growing\nFor the vegetables ten months of the year one of our other big program has

from their side you can be on their side that's why there's understood that or a free resource for the parents have the one in five kids with learning and attention issues go for misunderstanding to understood dot org ... by understood in the ad council\nWhen local news breaks there's only one station people turn to Dan in my own radio live in ... years and it is a limit in\nCase they be asking your smart speaker for about the newsletter and try to make sure you say please say play KF ab on I hire radio [noise]\nWelcome back to the elements show we invite you to send your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Greg at ... dot com Iraq\nThis is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies eighties nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and if money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed investments that\nThey might not pay much an interesting not only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you tried to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of a good so traditionally we would argue\nI'll take any more risk than is necessary to achieve your goals\nBut let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nPut the money into those call today but think about this when you die\nWho get fat money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse\nAnd ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids you could argue that that money really isn't yours it's ... and you\nAre merely the steward of that money you're the custodian your the caretaker of that money\nAnd if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age\nBut based on bears and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if you're a grand kids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nNow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what the ... ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and designed what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just calls a triple each plan wreck or visit us online at rice element dot com\nYou know we've got some of the aftermath of Hurricane Florence and Michael we've seen just astonishing devastation those storms came so quickly especially Michael\nAnd left so quickly but a huge amount of damage in the wake a gym and I are heavily
