about them by going to their website which is modern work sweeps dot com modern work sweeps dot com or just stop by during business hours eighty eight hundred extreme [laughter] well David I'm I'm a kind of a kind of curious about the the mega site taskforce because\nYou know one of the big challenges we have in this market is finding\nPlaces where we can have big developments are particularly for industrial\nRight there's actually showed up during our effort to try and convince Toyota to build their most recent automotive factory here somewhere in Nebraska\nAnd uh they told us real quickly that we need to have a slight under control\nOr that they could come in about a thousand acres plus or that they could predict with some certainty how long would take them degraded skip the utilities they're building such but we had to have it under control meaning cause I ownership\nAnd have it all designed in and ready to go for them and that was the one thing we couldn't do and we were close ... close wasn't good enough and so there was easy for them to Canada exclude us and the\nThe final analysis so we thought we ought to be about the business of trying to figure this out so we've got a task force that is working throughout this region with the state and with utilities et cetera to try and figure out\nHow do we pulled together a thousand ... piece of property that we can have control over and then get you get all the design work done so that is as close to a certified side as we can get the next time something pops up\nAnd that's what that's all about\nYeah so they were already on that it was actually one of the state level part in Nebraska blueprints as well mhm I'm looking at what state wide what do we need as far as mega sites so that we can be targeted in our efforts to try and go get some of these kinds of companies but also just be ready to respond different opportunity presents itself\nYou know you mentioned grading uh and and that sparked something that's been on my mind lately\nUm you know we've had in recent years so much um infield development in Omaha which is very very exciting and and that's going to continue for the foreseeable future but I've noticed lately you know we're really creating a lot of things on the frontier the suburban frontier lately and just yesterday I was driving on a two hundred and four street heading south\nAnd and I crossed a Westerner road and there are big projects being graded on both the southeast corner and the south west corner\nAnd then you drive out on um some of the the roads and far northwest Omaha degrading housing developments like crazy and then you're seeing a lot of grading and the ... area too and so it seems like after ... years and years of little slower growth on the frontier that's kind of popped back up again\nYeah you know I think we we were saying well you can look at the Boise down project is a good example ... five hundred acres being graded they basically they take an entire year to get that green project done you know they always say the Nebraska flat but not so much in this part of the American you got to really worry about getting site ready for their it's housing or offices or whatever it might be so\nI mean it is good to see all that grading happened meaning that site development is occurring um which will enable us to have more developed worker at the same time though we got to think about where is our water and sewer power gas fiber\nWhat is that quarter look like and do we still have enough space but where those things are already organized\nTo develop in instill as well as make sure we're doing some of the stuff outside to make sure we can grow in the future\nYeah uh you know we were talking earlier in the show about the critical role of of talent recruitment um we uh uh we do need to pull it a few more people here and wanted to hit the uh uh some research we've done to support Taliban recruitment [noise]\nYeah well basically we have all the numbers we knew we know what the demographics look like we know a population growth looks like we know what I'm you know where the jobs are and where they're not being filled you know what the shortages are we know what the tail pipe ... look like\nYou do all the math and basically it says we're short [laughter] and just about every category and so we've got to do a lot of have a lot of work and partnering with your educational institutions both a K. through twelve as well as me to college and and\nAnd working with the unions and working with a trade folks to make sure we have another blue collar white collar white collar workers to fill it kind of jobs we have open here\nYeah and that's a constant battle because as you and I said before on the show many times we need to uh\nThey need to essentially double our our population growth\nUh but the music is playing David which means that we are out of time it always goes too fast there was always stuff on the docket we

seven that he's retired and ask a question about required minimum distribution so Thomas what is your question\nYes uh I wanted to know things about our ages I currently have a\nTraditional a or a on a on a roll over and I also have a role and my question was when you start checking on the east which I'll be doing next year\nOh I Know you have to total up the balance of the alright but is the raw or a included in that ballot\nThat you take 'em you're offering these um\nYeah great question Russian great question so when you calculate the R. M. D. amount what you're going to do is if you're going to add up all of your pre tax accounts\nYour traditional i._r._a. your role over IRA your four one K. if you're not working are you still working right now are you actively contributing to an employer plan\nAhead I Am not working part time on it but I'm not contributing to impose on\nSo if you were working you would be able to exclude that current four one K. but you're going to add up all your\nTax accounts traditional i._r._a. roll over four one K. you are not going to add the Roth IRA a value in your calculation\nUm so what you basically have the pre tax you're going to exclude the Ross ah and then this is actually when we're building um\nWhen we're building income plans for people we look at different and distinct uh categories of investments the pre tax the raw or the brokerage account any savings and so as we're trying to figure out how to you know get people that paycheck that retirement pay check the the money will come from different places\nNow have you ever thought about so you've got this Ross and you've got the pre tax accounts have you ever gone through any sort of Ross conversion calculation have you ever considered anything along those lines\nOn I considered it I'm done on okay about ... or ... years ago and I'm I'm going to be doing another one because\nThis is my last year that solve the seven and a half next year I'm going to a second raw conversion from a traditional our right\nThe the issue that kind of um the sidelines a lot of people is that so what what happens with these Ross conversions is you have these pre tax amounts you effectively take a distribution\nI. E. earned income for whatever you want to move from the pre tax Ira over to the Ross so a lot of different factors\nUm you know kind of old way on the viability of this move what your taxes are now what they're going to be leader your overall financial situation but the thing that trips up a lot of people as their ability or inability\nTo pay taxes\nOn the distribution with outside of the IRA money\nSo as long as you have the ability to pay that tax burden with outside the IRA money and as long as you've gone through the calculations you should be fine\nOkay great great\nAwesome well Thomas thanks for calling the show and a really have a great week thank you very much\nNow it's time for this week's portfolio review and this is where Andy died deeply into a portfolio that's been sent to us\nAnd this week Andy's review has his Social Security twist to it and that's perfect because we're trying to help Americans today with a limited free offer for a portfolio review that includes of Social Security analysis\nNow a reminder make sure you consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor by going to investing sense dot com\nSo now this week's review Larry says his portfolio and he writes\n... if you plan to take Social Security and you have a sizable four one K. does the draw from the four oh one K. impact Social Security payments suppose I make Fifteen thousand dollars part-time draw Social Security and pull sixty thousand dollars how will that sixty thousand dollars impact Social Security\nHey great question Larry let me tell ya Larry's got a pretty cool story we went back and forth over email the first thing that I asked Larry was when is all of this going to come together you've got his\nReply to yeah he said I plan to retire and the next eight to Nineteen months I'm sixty one I'll be sixty two in January and I want to work part time next year I have about one point four million in a four one K. and three hundred thousand in cash\nI Know if I go over a certain kept while on Social Security I'm I'm not going to get the full benefit\nRight so the rule that Larry is referencing only applies when you reach full retirement age and that's when your earnings no longer reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn now\nIf you're younger than full retirement age and you make more than the annual earnings limit\nYour earnings may actually reduce your benefits so it's based on this for retirement age right for Americans born between Nineteen forty three and Nineteen fifty for your full retirement age is sixty six\nA beginning with you guys born in Nineteen fifty five two months or added for every ... year until\nThe full retirement age reaches sixty seven for Americans born in Nineteen sixty year later\nSo what are the ... to the benefits in case you reached the earnings limit\nIf you're under full retirement age for the whole year\nSocial Security ... a dollar from your benefits for every two dollars that you earn above the annual limit and for twenty Eighteen that limit is Seventeen thousand forty dollars\nNow if you can imagine it gets a little bit more complex in the year you reach full retirement age\nSocial Security did that's a dollar and benefits for every three dollars that you earn above the limit for twenty Eighteen that limit is forty five thousand three hundred and sixty dollars but they only count earnings before the month that you reach\nFull retirement age [laughter] see I don't know yeah I Know my head spinning I was trying to keep track I was ... he wrote the right it don't even know the first sentence I was okay and then tried to keep track of limits in ages just it's unbelievable\nYeah Social Security is just ridiculously complex the worst part is all these rules\nThey frequently change so your optimal Social Security claiming strategy could absolutely be a moving target that is how I add a lot of value to my clients overall wealth picture\nBy making sure that they are optimizing they're claiming strategy but everybody's optimal strategy is different because everybody's situation is so unique\nAnd part of today's limited
