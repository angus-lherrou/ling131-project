capacity my wife and I could not be farther apart right up but we have to have a plan that a combination of both of us and so I\nIf you haven't figured out and the the much more aggressive one of the two of us my wife is a conservative any Klein I've ever had in my career okay and so that's saying something so you will help you with that that's the are and of course finally T my absolute favorite area\nIs tax efficient planning can we minimize taxes in all areas of your life that you may not be obligated to pay but unfortunately because you didn't get anyone to help plan the taxes you're going to pay out you end up over paying the average American pays over a quarter of a million more in taxes in their lifetime than they should\nI Can't guarantee I can get all that back for you because ... obviously you're already whatever age you are but I can probably guarantee you I can show you a couple of strategies that can lessen the blow from here until you're no longer with us\nJust just yesterday I had a client in did not save a ton ton of money ... compared to average client and again we don't care will help anyone that really a serious about their future David if they're serious were serious but this individual is going to save about forty thousand dollars and she literally almost started tearing up my\nUm it's real money guys that you're leaving on the table and without\nProper planning so if that is you out there\nMaybe it's time you hire a new coach right maybe it's time for you to step up and ... you know the the the dream coach that you could get for your retirement I'm not going to be that person people in my team are not going to be that for every one of you that's reality\nI certainly think were were given a shot to and finding out what might be different from maybe who you're currently are and folks\nWho ever you're going to work with who ever this person's going to be are they in independent fiduciary based advisor in other words or they legally obligated themselves to tell you what is in your best interests\nOr they somebody's just selling commission based investments in securities and doesn't really care how your accounts actually do you gotta ask yourself these questions is very important\nAh but if that you and you want to find out who that coaches look we make it so easy we're going to give you a complementary smart retirement report card and no obligation world will simply grade the basic information\nAnd then will present to you get to where the where the season these might be on your report card are and and then if you want us to show you how to fix them that we'd be happy to do that too but you don't have to hire city unless you want to\nBut whoever it is you're going to work with it's very important that you understand are they looking at all these areas is the coach gonna look at everything though is if we are it's got for us just run the are often said he ran in Oregon\nHow do you think Nebraska would do not too good if he never looked at the defense or special teams and obviously that's been where some of the big holds a bit nuts bar but he's got to build out\nA system that works in each area\nOf coaching the team right and it's the same thing in retirement you better have an advisor who can help you understand the investments that can ... understand the income understand the risks understand the taxation understand the healthcare you're going to be with\nAnd even things like a state planning we haven't got into all that there's so much that goes into a properly designed retirement plan we think the smart plan is the answer but we want to make it easy so we just developed this report card so you can kind of just get the scratch the services and see what's going on\nIf you want to take advantage again be one of the first seven colors this week or just tax the word smart to four o two three six nine seven seven seven seven four o two three six nine seven seven seven

that's it so important that you bring together all the access and oh the financial planning\nBut that's the reason why coach frost was hired but more importantly the reason why he was hired was because he is Nebraska born and bred right I mean that's who you are you are not born in Nebraska but you're so\nMitt it to Nebraska and the people here in Omaha I I think that's a that's the heart of who you are is the reason why I think you know you have my vote for financial planner of of you know the best financial planner mobile\nNo cause you have the exit nose down you understand finances I mean granted you you're teaching it you're at the local college you're teaching it\nBut what makes you who you are David is really your heart\nTo serve the people of your community I mean you're also like you said on several advisory boards or you're involved in the community or\nOr the politics of it as well as for the progress of it and so that tells me you're not just here for the finances

talking with Jeanie Jeanie there yes I Am now your husband uh is is having issues with the fact that the babies are born with with disabilities yeah and this and Pete's on his face\nPardon the St Pete's faith but does he have faces they're yes okay yeah so he wrestles with does it keep him from having faced buddy\nIt he wrestles with it right in ... ... ... ... ... somehow I I don't know well a lot of health I I thought\nWell it is normal and it is healthy for him to question these things because it shows compassion on his part and and that's a good thing um so the question becomes you know I guess academically it becomes will you know why does God allow these things right and not just reach in well it sounds simple\nBut it's kind of like when you start looking at things that you don't like in the United states and you start going I you know I don't like the way that person thinks oh I don't like the way they act I wish we could just ban that then what ends up happening is what in the United states or the constitution says that once you start banning that then\nThe things you can you believe in can be banned as well and it starts this whole cycle right that breaks down the entire system\nSo you have to let people be who they are within reason as long as it doesn't cause danger harmed anyone else you have to allow people to be who they are even if you disagree now you stretch that\nOr to God looking over the universe and everything in it and saying what I Want are creatures that can love and the only way creatures can truly love is to allow them the option not to love\nSo are the only way you can allow creatures truly love God or anything else the the only reason your husband knows that you love him is because you come home to him every night by choice\nThat you ... if he had a gun to your head it wouldn't be love right you'd just be doing it because he was forcing you so if God force people to do right it's no longer doing right it's like the uh\nUh you know putting a murderer in solitary confinement he doesn't murder anymore right he's not good because if you had the opportunity you would murder so just because uh\nYou know it just because you took a the mortality out of it or you assume that you you know uh keep a this prisoner I'm so we can't kill that he now he's a better person no it just means he doesn't have the opportunity or the choice that is not better that's without any morality so\nGod in order to to create a a creature that has that can truly love has to give them an option to love so what these creatures do is some of them go towards gone\nSeeking God seeking God's will in God's love and loving God and therefore trying to abide by the rules of God which are the rules of the universe truly\nAnd I'm a when it comes to pollution or drugs or things like that um they would uh shun them but then there are those that look to cut corners to make more money to build a their empire to do all kinds of things are to get high to do whatever that ah pollutes\nGenetic line and then what ends up happening is you have mutations I'm not saying the parents of some of a of a disabled child have done something they're ... themselves you're talking about it could be generations and generations generations of a a a go of people that they don't know\nI'm the purpose of that is to understand that everybody is responsible for one another and in in doing that you know it keeping in mind that there is the percentage\nOf of Americans that are disabled is approximately about Seventeen percent and of that percentage of disabled people about fifty percent of them are born that way so it it it makes you one say does it is a disabled person worth less than you\nOf course not of course not so what she looks at is the quality well why does this happen at all and and why would you know why we got allow this it has to be allowed in the process of things because in order to eliminate that I'm variable that possibility would be to have to take away\nThe consequences of anything that people did wrong\nAnd you have to allow consequences in life because that that helps build character it's like um if you think about all the wonderful things in life that you know ... courage all these things\nJeannie those don't exist without adversity do they uh you know a fireman or a firefighter cannot be a hero without a fire or some sort of adversity same with the law enforcement or anything like that so the balance of adversity\nAnd faith in strength and nobility and all these things love versus a indifference or even hate that these things only exist in this world in this way because this is not the best world Jeannie it's the best way to the best world which is heaven\nAnd the reason why states the best ways because you have to go through this process\nUh to understand\nAnd therefore once you're in heaven there won't be any of that there won't be any a disability in heaven there won't be in tears in heaven there won't be any of that but here there has to be those things as long as people a\nMess with the genetic line by doing what they want when they want\nA and a once again I Want to clarify this because some people try and push this on to the parents and if you remember in scripture um someone came to me and said uh you know this man's blind why's he blind is it something is it a sin he did or send that his parents did and I said ... and neither had nothing to do with that um\nBut the line that genetic wine does have impurities in it that people have placed there that were never supposed to be there in the garden it's not the way it was designed and so these things take place and I know that\nThat it affects people and affects people like your husband um but he has to see that in in order to eradicate all of that I'd have to eradicate everyone's free will and in doing that then what do you have\nThen you have an entire planet um that is disabled or spiritually and more morally because you you wouldn't have any option to do things differently I I'd have to program you\nAnd it's it's like saying you know ... you can keep your child safe if you lock them in a closet to [noise] but then what does he become so I'm not going to lock you all in closets and make all the decisions for you what I'm going to do is I'm going to stand over here and I'm going to show you every single day by knocking\nAnd the door of your heart that I Love you and then I Want to come in and if you allow me to come in and you seek my will any read my scriptures and spend time with my people and and pray to my father and these types of things than you will start to learn that the system's okay\nBut meanwhile you know I'm sure your husband's speeds on occasion or does things that are against the law even little little breaking little rules here and there because he thinks it's okay but that that can affect people\n\n\nNews\nThe Jesus Christ show I Am your holy

I have a feel logical quest okay and that's a reference to first Corinthians ... and\nA verse Nineteen and twenty [noise] um and the reason I'm Wondering about if I have a very fundamentalist Christian family\nWho are sometimes they just drives me crazy\nWait whoa this is hard to believe are you saying that there's sometimes there's fundamental Christians that can be oh I don't know pushy yeah ad is really hard to believe that a ... a little I have to say okay\nWell uh some of some of the the buffet that I've overheard the than directed to me\nFor example is that uh [noise] uh the the Hurricane Katrina was God's wrath ... people in the world oh boy I'm the earth is only five thousand years old and oh boy I'm dating is the devil cool oh boy\nOh and how but I Will agree that carbon fourteen dating is not the best way to do any more it's gotten better um we have a much better tools to to date scientifically than carbon fourteen but go ahead\nYeah I'm I have one cousin or a loved dearly um who\nHas made state with regard educational very demeaning faith um and to quote a all they teach you in school is a bunch of useful ferries [noise] um if all of us have garbage said that in front of his ... is the only time you're folding fault\nLaid off of like school [noise] and we respond to the ... or or educational to my wife and I have a very important for a life in Richmond\nSure experiences through our lives and I have\nA written a ham regarding matters of his response is um\nUh the life of the education of garbage and I really need to have have to talk of hail and he throws back out of the first printing of of a chapter one where a verse vi team or I Will destroy the wisdom otherwise and the clever enough of the clever I Will satisfied and over twenty of\nEnds up with has a God made foolish the wisdom of of the world in other words uh educational uh equivalent to a clever enough and I was just like to\nKnow what a veteran her for patients that isn't as ... or I Am a figure of truth okay as a Christian\nAnd I I feel that my uh you never stopped farming of F ... attitude I'm sixty seven years old retired and I never thought of software to [noise] um [noise]\nBut is there any place or elsewhere in the Bible that promotes education per se oh\nAbsolutely but let's look at this let's look at this is big as we possibly can a first\nUm I joked with you about a fundamentalist because\nThe truth of the matter is there are all kinds of people involved in the body of Christ yeah and I came in I died for every single one of them and there's going to be those that have different hang ups those have different desires of the way they worship\nAnd I poked fun because I think the importance of the by Christ not take themselves seriously but the word of God seriously\nSo I'm saying that I Want Christians to look at themselves and go am I being closed minded to not receive or I'm standing firm on a principle that is important because there's a difference you can be ... bull headed\nAnd not receive in that I don't want I don't I don't want that near my name at all I don't want people are associating with me but what I Do want is somebody who is confident or in their world view and will stand upon that and defend it\nAnd I don't feel now they're not here to defend themselves in all fairness and to ah make their case\nBut in just in the context in which you're telling me I don't feel they're being fair no I I agree with you that's not very fair and there are a lot of Christians that do that that's my hope for this program is to shed light on things and help people reason three things strangely enough\nThat's directly from scripture scripture says come let us reason together it says to worship God with all of your heart all of your soul and all of your mind\nUh Christians should not have to leave their brain at the door\nOr when they come into the kingdom of God now diverse in which you're referring to is although your um this is a family member\nYeah I'm more than a lot of there's about three people or we don't live near that I'm there all the all of a of\nA and another state okay well the way I Do love your statement earlier that we are truth seekers absolutely that that really a A R I listen to that out here that have made an impact\nOtherwise who cares then the new ones right now you can you can both be wrong but you can't be right the purpose of truth scripture throughout you see things where people say God is love absolutely but God is truth yeah\nAnd it's not some false truth it's not you know true to his relatives all of that is garbage truth is not relative truth is truth\nThey that statement doesn't even make any sense\nSo there if there is truth it's absolute truth if there's absolute truth you know it and you can learn it and you can live at so\nWhen you're talking about um first Corinthians chapter one versus Nineteen although this is where it was quoted from I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... of the clever I Will set aside its really quoting\nThe Old Testament I say uh twenty nine fourteen\nThat's why it starts to burst starts with Ford has written it's referencing eyes at so it's good to know both as a a twenty nine fourteen and this reference to know its context in both places it's not talking about mainstream academia\nIt's talking about the religious leaders of the day and I say I was talking about um\nUh Jews that were like worshipping and experiencing and going through their daily practice worshipping God but never really knowing God there are ways ... wisdom to themselves religiously so in both context it's not talking about mainstream academia it's talking about religious academia\nIt's talking about those that say this is the right way to worship\nStrangely enough it ties more into your conversation than not a meaning that the ... the religious folks that will\nGet caught up in the religion of something for instance and this is not to pick on anybody I'm at all and I know that there's debate within the church about the age of the universe or the age of the earth rather\nWell that five thousand which is not even I'm a what a young earth what they refer to as young earth creationist believe it's ... it's round six but\nThat is based upon um [noise] that is based upon genealogy isn't scripture\nThat are not even complete so the assumption is well these genealogy would roughly you know roll out to about this time so that's got to be the beginning of the earth when it never says that in scripture anywhere and never makes that statement this is the age of the earth anywhere\nYet people will come to that conclusion and they'll stand on it and not have any leeway and on this program and we say this a lot it is in the essential Z unity there's no wavering and the essentials on this program ever so in the central unity", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Our American Stories", "city": "Omaha", "day": "21"}
