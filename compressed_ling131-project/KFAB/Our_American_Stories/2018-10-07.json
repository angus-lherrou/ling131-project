{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "Sounds delightful to me [laughter] yeah um so let's talk about ... Ross conversions and I know we're talking about that before but again we're talking about because now is a great opportunity for a lot of folks to detect that four one K. R. I. R. A. and do that Ross conversion\nYeah you see what happens is remember ra\nRa is tax free yes traditional higher race you don't have any taxes going into to get a tax deduction but everything coming out is taxable what happens is that you can take traditional Irene money and you can convert it over to tax free now that the big problem I what holds that most people\nIs that if you have a hundred thousand you take out a hundred thousand I traditional put it in a rough you owe tax as ordinary income taxes on that hundred thousand dollars but but what happens is most people not all the most people are very heavy on the traditional side not as much on the ... side in converting\nIs a could be a very good idea so what happens if you have a hundred thousand thinking about a partial conversion so you take ten thousand dollars I ...\nIn any all of a sudden now you're maybe gonna oh let's say you were to\nThe state and federal on a thirty percent tax bracket you'll three thousand not thirty thousand like you would if it was a hundred thousand and you can ... year after year after year also if you're thinking about converting maybe you wait\nUntil you go in and you are retired because then your income most likely would be lower and it's better to have income coming in taxable income if your income is lower so maybe you wait until you retire so what what we do as a people come on and we're going to really kind of look at your full financial picture\nAnd find out ... and I and I I've always said this and it is true\nIf I make you a dollar\nInvestment money you just earn a dollar not cutting taxes you earn a dollar if I save you a dollar in taxes it's just like making a dollar so if you can turn traditional to tax free\nThat in itself anyone who's paying taxes would love that but there is a tax burden on the conversion how do you go in and less than nephew parcels or there's some other strategies to that we talk about so yeah we do a lot with Ross um IRAs and tax free Ross can versus\nAnd again that do you like you said spreading out over time that ... I mean you can convert a lot of money over time and and by the time you retire or even if you're in retirement five years later I mean that is that's fair for that's a tax free money\nThat's a big deal and also remember this there's no required minimum distributions honor Ross okay so what happens is is that\nIf the if you're married the husband doesn't take if he passes the wife does that take if they both passed the children do you have to take an R. M. D. but it's tax free in Second Life you know with the traditional Irish seven half you cannot\nAdd or put in on a new investment in traditional heir after seven and a half but as long as you have working income you can with the raw so Ross are you don't get the benefits up front\nBut you get it down the road and I'll tell you what many times especially if you're in a in a middle tier tax bracket a rough makes a lot of sense\nHey you know we've got a question on the way here and uh I think we've got to go do this quick let's say let's give it a little okay so here's the question I've been bombarded with ads featuring low cost rubble advisory platform that have a lot of online financial planning tools what are these tools lack that an in person financial planner can provide how about a personality [laughter]\nYeah yeah there's a lot of information out robo you basically computer I'm kinda generated show hype a platform yep\nAnd Tom by the you know I'm I'm a human being this is my business I think I bring a lot of value to the relationship on investing but I Will say this is certainly could be something to consider 'cause 'cause it it's going to have a lower cost than if you go to a financial advisor like myself there there's there's virtually no\nOr extremely low human interaction when it comes to robo advising now that platform\nHas only been around in this market it was not around to find out what a great point\nWhat a great oh yeah so now we're talking about um an emotion earlier in the show yeah and emotion right what what things are going great you know what every was good at what they do ... everybody's making them\nFunny but the most important thing is when the time comes that could falters we've not had a bear market or twenty percent decline\nIn over nine and a half years and normally happens just over five years historically almost double the time period so when that happens and and and and those robo advisers who's going to hold that clients hand who's going to call and explaining was doing who's doing in in in and saying hey we need to rebels not then\nBut beforehand so no doubt I have some bias there because that's the profession that I'm In ... we think we do a very very good job of talking with our clients\nThat I think he was always done is kind of pick people's interest than let's let's open up the phone lines again let's invite folks to give us a call come on and sit down and talk about that plant talk about making things right\nIf you call during the show at our one of the next five callers we're going to offer a compliment refinance review of your entire\nFinancial in retirement plan or there's no cost for the visit is simply a chance for you to get educated about your money so you can make the best financial decision for yourself moving forward about what we found is that most people don't really have a true understanding of two basic things they don't really understand how much\nUnnecessary

jumping or stand these two important but many times miss understood issues so if you call during the show\nAnd you want to the next five colors that only will you get the financial review in second

appreciate\nThe route of the question ... um my father's a Catholic in ...\nAnd I know how you kinda feel about your holiness but with that being said um I think my parents church my mother's eighty three and my dad's eighty six and so I have to take a boat every Sunday which I don't mind\nUm but one day I was at the oval in church\nAnd the elder at the podium just all of a separate set after you've finished with the sermon and whatever he said I'm ... or so and so it's no longer Jehovah witness and everybody was just like what just happened what's your thought on this fellow shipping people\nWell I I certainly don't speak to the theology or the structure of the Jehovah's Witness belief system is not the belief system of uh this radio program or or any producers\nSo um and not one that this program or it's radio producers would\nUm [noise] recommend so having said that they have their own system in which they adhere to their own system in which uh they teach and they control the structure of their church body it\nDoesn't mean that others don't or even solar system you can be excommunicated from Folsom and uh there are other church Protestants in uh in nature that would ask somebody to leave the church it's contingent upon what the structure and the rules of that particular church\nAre and um how they feel ... you know execute them in the the process of teaching so it's up to them it's it's their world\nAnd a war of their new world is the case may be but it's their world and\nThey can make their a structure any way they they wish there is a time and there is scriptural references when people were ostracized or allowed to go or asked to go um to get clarity in their life before they come back and bring\n'em out or ugliness or bitterness into the church and I think it's\nA although I may not agree with the reasons they're doing it for or the way they're doing it I think sometimes you\nThere's wounds that you mend and there's ones that you amputate in life otherwise you don't amputate them they make the whole body sick and I think that the uh ... you and I may not agree with the reasons they did it but the premise is still a legitimate one that is sometimes you have to protect the many from the one\nI understand by the way my mother loves your show too [laughter]\nWell that's nice to hear the show is the ... if\nWe all your listeners do every time I have to have the raiders led me to do that in the first got upset\nJesus oh you have a mom it's just it's just it's just a radio station the guy very knowledgeable and she loves you feel and my dad love your show with my mom you Joe the this is what he says well All right thank you for your question I mean for your answer\nMy pleasure I'm honored when anybody takes the time to listen I'm but we're also very honest as to the point of view and where we come from so that people don't get confused\nAnd there is a we try and focus on the things that we agree on a than the things we disagree on 'em but the truth of the matter is that ah\nWhen someone is excommunicated from a church the church has that right based on whatever their structure is as long as everybody knows that going into it than they're signing off on that saying okay I won't do that or I won't partake in those things where I won't be a part of that or bring the end of the church or\nThe kingdom hall or whatever it is and in that\nUh agreement or you're allowing the church to discipline even way they see fit\nAnd that is okay I wouldn't always agree there are many ah groups churches that X communicator kick people out for reasons I think are asinine but that they go into it knowing that that's the and I see this in Catholicism a lot a\nLot of people say I'm a Catholic but I don't believe X Y and Z and it's like well that's not really fair because that's what ... if you just don't want to drop the name ... um 'cause you're attached to it\nThen you know say I'm a social Catholic or something or use a model fire otherwise it's not fair to the church they are trying to keep a belief system alive and they're the ones that are allowed to make the rules\nAnd you can either be a part of it or not be a part of it but when you kind of try and be a part of it and then go buy your own rules and the church organization has the right to say by we don't we don't want you are involved with us\nGreg welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nFirst of all thank you very much for taking my call I appreciate oh my pleasure and how can I help and yes I think I have a question and I got a second part of that question first of all I Would like to know who the holy ghost\nIs and is it true that the holy ghost is the body Jesus is the heart and the brain is God\nNo ah that is a at\nBest that is something called a an economic trinity that's when somebody tries to make an analogy or for people to understand the trinity in a way that is in the physical realm or things like that and what happens is it breaks down because that that that's not the case\nNow it may help people understand well uh you know this is kind of the positioning and how they work but the reality is they're they're all equal\nNow your heart your body and your mind are all equal in the sense that you can't live with one or or the other they all have to be tied to one another so there are parts of that analogy that that might run or has some legs to him but ultimately when you start breaking it down it doesn't make sense because the\nUm because of the positions being different doesn't mean that the substance is different so the Holy Spirit is the third person in the trinity and the Holy Spirit has very specific a duty is if you will and responsibilities and focus but is\nProtect your child's teacher at every stage of life go to

I Want to believe but it it's really hard\nWell first of all I Do want to point out that not every Christians happy and certainly\nNot every Christian a successful but I Know what you're saying that you see that that that it does work for some people and worked in quotes and that there's there might be something to it but what do you what do you think is keeping what are you afraid of\n'em I don't know\nI I don't know I don't know what it is I don't know if it's fresh and\nI'm just I guess that a lot of things have happened in my life where I ... I Want to know why like why did it happen I don't want to blame or something or blame God I ... I like to think that maybe it happen for a reason\nBut it it just after time after time again when something bad happened and I don't know why it happened I Want to know and I want to believe maybe\nMaybe it's happening for a reason and\nAsk questions you know that the people that you asked this question it's people that do you go to church ask them you know why why what God or how\nHow how does this either out of it where Rick how do you how do you believe in it so so faithfully how do you believe that he's there how can you trust\n[noise] well it's interesting that you talk about bad things happening\nAnd you also talked about good things happening there's people that have good things happen to them and you point out the bad things happen what's a what's a bad thing how could you describe what a good thing was or bad thing was if there wasn't some ruler some judge something above it all\nThe gives you that understanding and your heart and your head as to what's good and bad\n\nThere is no God good and bad does it mean anything\nIs society that decides well that's good or that's bad because there's different societies that believe different things there's can of ballistic societies you wouldn't think it was good to eat people so why\nWhy do you think things are are good and bad and then question the the concept of God\nI guess um [noise]\nWell I guess what I feel in my heart out I guess that's what I've been taught ... just what I Know I've never really been the church\nAnd I haven't really uh you know steady the I studied the Bible on my on average versus last day I read on about ... about the loving apart 'cause there's a lot of people in this world that so they use the Bible to\nTo be bigoted or insure and not love and hate\nAnd that's that makes me like turns me away from it one of the people are like that it just turns me away and so I'm just confused I don't I don't know and I want this I Want this bird in this hole in my heart to stop\nThat why I don't want it to be there I Want to want to be okay and I'm looking for you but no one's ever really have the answers and I'm I'm doing it on my own so\nWell what are your questions\nHow do I believe how do I believe that like do I have to wait for AmeriCorps to ask you just keep studying the last\nYou just take it till I make it [noise] I don't know but you ...\nOut every day you experienced things you use face every day\nAnd let me explain this is what a lot of people in the church won't tell you they want you to believe that faith is this thing where you just jump off every moment that you don't ask questions that you don't wait for answers you just do it and that's what faith is and that's not\nFaith is that portion that you can't know no matter what you do you can't know it\nAnd that exists in life so Ninety percent you know and you should know and you should learn and study ask questions but there's going to be a percentage Gary there's gonna be a part that you can't know for instance you look at a chair\nAnd you trust your eyes and you say my eyes say that's a chair my eyes say that that's a ... would share my belief is my understanding and my experience is that would have strong\nThat when it's put together in this way as a carpenter probably used would glue and nails or screws to combine them together\nTo make that chair and that that chair is probably at a regulated construction in such a way that it will withstand me sitting on it\nBut the minute you sit on at the moment and Gary you put the entire weight of who you are on that chair that faith\nSo with God it's no different you do everything you can study to learn to to find out things but there's a point where you can't no you don't know if that cheers going to hold you up to you sit in that\nAnd there's nothing in life no one can hand it to you\nKnow one can point you do a scripture and go this is the one that's going to make all clear this is the one that you're gonna Christians act that way sometimes they're eager\nAnd they ... this is what's going to do it or or you got to do is is it's not about that it is scripture says test all things hold fast to that which is true that's it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Our American Stories", "city": "Omaha", "day": "07"}
