it's kind of the roots\n\nWhen they when the ... century finally rolled around pope Gregory the third designated November first as something called all saints day\nThis was a was a time to\nHonor saints and murders that had passed on\nYou can't look at that as a bad thing centrally honoring those in the Christian family that had done good\nAnd we're no longer on this earth well as often is the case this particular this new holiday incorporated many of the traditions of the ... festival\nSo a lot of the things that kind of the ... that were already are being used to celebrate and sound when\nWe're now kind of attached to this all\nSaints day you can kind of\nThink of it this way it's much easier to paint an old building\nAnd put up a new sign and it is to to tear down the whole building and start from scratch right and this was nothing new and have been done many times we for for instance many pagan customs were combined with Christianity when Constantine\nWent through the big conversion his was a slow conversion but when he latched onto it sometime around his forties\n\nHe converted the official pagan religion of the Roman empire to Christianity as was between three twenty and three thirty da da Silva ... little things came in and found their way home to Christianity that had a beginning in paganism\n\nSo back to a all saints day the evening before all saints day was a known is all Hallows eve and this is you can figure out later became Halloween\nBut over the centuries\nThis this day this Halloween has evolved and continues to evolve and continues to change

as you think\nAnd every year I get calls and emails about Halloween and yes it is all the Wayne is rooted in paganism but that doesn't automatically mean that a Christian who can't partake in it in some way or some fashion\n\nSo this Celtic festival of selling a later through\nA pope Gregory the third designated November first as all saints day so it's all around the same time and this is to honor the saints in the martyrs but a lot of the traditions and ideas and certain other practices in from the ... festival\nIts way into that as well\nThe evening before\nOr this became a known as a all Hallows eve that became Halloween now you've got this very commercial secular non pagan religiously anyways\nEvent and\nIt's important to just realize that God's problem with paganism or other belief systems\nIs not necessarily their practices but that they do those practices while worshipping another got altogether exodus twenty first three you shall have no other ... before me just say if the lord that is God's word that's the concern\nGod wants you to celebrate and glorify him and every thing you do\n...\nAnd has to understand this a little better just keep in mind two thousand years ago pagan sacrificed animals\nBut so did our Jewish brothers and sisters under God's command the same act with different intent was now a pleasing aroma to God as it says in genesis eight twenty and Twenty one and I'll read that the NOAA built an altered to the lord\nAnd taking some of the clean animals and cleaning birds he sacrificed burnt offerings on it the lord smelled the pleasing aroma and set in his heart never again like curse the ground because of humans even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from\nChildhood and never again will lie destroy all living creatures as I have done\nSo it's not just the act itself it is the intended purpose of that act that matters to God sacrifice to idols or a false God not good\nSacrifice to the one true holy and righteous God\nGood he pleasing aroma\nDiscarding something just because ... or any other faith did it at one time or\nDoes it now really isn't isn't balanced and it isn't thoughtful\nIt's the\nIt's like that or you know vegetarianism is bad because Hitler adhered to uh primarily vegetarian diet just seems like a weird way to go about life rather than seeing things for what they are and using them to glorify God\nOr its fallacious to think that because something had origins here orange origins over here that it's good or bad really it's the application you probably don't even know how many things already in your life come from pagan origins\nYes what you can look down at your a left\nHand there if you're wearing a wedding ring you're wearing\nSomething with origins in paganism in ancient magic\n\nAnd the concept of the circle as it is seen as this andel lesson timeless\n\nThing that you can wear and it suggests a kind of repetitive are unbroken time and space and you can see it in many pagan uses a such a Stonehenge\nAnd others that predate Christianity\nAnd even in Christianity itself there are symbols and practices that come from or were used by pagan the cross itself\nIs a pagan symbol\nAnd wasn't even used very very early on in the Christian Church\nBut you don't think of things that way\nYou don't think that there's an overlap where there is a mingling at all but there is a sure you and your everyday life and even in your face\n\nAnd his Eighteen Seventy eight essay on the development of the Christian doctrine John Henry Newman who was\nOriginally a priest in the church of England and later a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church wrote these words they use of temples and these dedicated to particular sayings\nAn ornament id on occasion with branches of trees incense lamps candles\nHoly days and seasons use of calendars for sessions blessings on the fields the ring and marriage all of our all of pagan origin and sank defied by their adoption into the church\n\nSo even the cross that adorn many churches has pagan origins also the beloved fish symbol used by many to identify themselves as Christians whether it's on your clothing or on your car um it was used by pagan generations before Christianity\nThe new age movement Hindus towers Buddhist and others use the symbol of the fish to express their own beliefs different beliefs as well\n\nSymbol for Virgo the sixth astrological Simon ... if you look has a pagan fish in it because\nOf its the direction of the fish people don't always noticed that in the dictionary of symbols that states that Virgo is based

all the literary\nBut the but but pre dating that very story yes and that's that's my point that you have feasts that are Jewish and brother are brothers and sisters part took in around the same times as they were pagan fest\nEast and the Jews did not want to appear to be pagan the little bit of laws as a matter of fact uh the majority of them or to a a separate themselves from the even the appearance of being pig and yet they did things that pagan did as well so it wasn't about the things that they did it was about how they applied that\nRight and I understand\nI understand the difference between what I'm Talking about the the ring that situation is Jesus the latter thank Elie\n... there are things that are being sent to fight every day by the use of a Christianity I mean do you celebrate Christmas\nBefore the earthquake right yeah but that's not sanctify by God in any stretch any way shape or form and scripture there's never a celebration about that nor is there a

there about a mile away in there Yes sir uh I wouldn't\nThink that anybody would really thick of it as being evil unless they warship it as evil I look at it as fictional\nAnd fictional characters just like anything else and fun for the kids I mean unless you're warship them and people if they think they're evil the mascot or whatever that would uh like I said go to a job if I don't believe it goes to ... which is good stuff like that anyway\nUh well I have no oil ship them and put them before God it's just a holiday for the kids\nI think that as well said I think there's a lot of people that ah see it for something that it's not or that it was once um but it doesn't involve those things in truly it lands on the parents to make the decision in the life for their child a but\nThey'd be careful you there are things you know we see on the program off and that their wounds you bandage and wounds you amputate so it doesn't pervert the rest of the body\nAnd there are some things you want to cut from your life possibly and say well we don't want this we don't want that but there's also things that you can um rebranded restructuring away um that are fun and healthy and I can have a good time and I speak to many many Christians\nAnd inevitably you ask them and they say well I just don't want your child and well where you are brought up in a Christian households yes but my parents let us celebrate it and\nHow long have you been worshipping the devil now\nIt's it's not necessarily the way the path goes and you want to protect your children to the best of your ability but also keep in mind that if you're over sensitive on things that are benign or neutral or that you can um [noise] uh you can put an understanding\nOf Christianity on it then sometimes it confuses and causes great rebellion and that's not to say to be a lukewarm wishy washy upbringing 'cause you don't want the kids rebel it's not my point\nPoint is that ... or make sure that the things that you're trying to cut from their life that you make a good case for it and that it's understood across the board otherwise truly is they\nGet older and start doing their own research search and seeing that there's all kinds of things in your home that have a pagan origin and customs and things like that then\nAnd then they'll start turning it back on you and of course that will be a problem\n[noise] Charlie welcome to the Jesus Christ show I Hi Charlie how can they help you\nI um I had a question about I'm like how do I give 'em glory to God and me I'm like every day and both things in life like going to a movie with friends or mowing the grass or everything like that you know\nWell there's it really comes down to if you hear a a child talk about their parents and you asked that child will you know would you give your life or your parent they'd\nSay yes but you asked that same child if they'll\nMow the lawn or do the dishes and they'll go oh I don't want to and Christians do this sometimes too it's like they you would lie lay down your life for your God if necessary but you won't live your life for God and that means every little boring thing your parents don't want to be\nA ... you to be at their foot every ten seconds going gosh you're the greatest parents and the whole wide world ... they want you expressing that in the things that you do showing them that the life\nThey've given you will be a life that's productive\nAnd righteous and ah with filled with purpose and God wants the same thing yes God wants you to worshipping God once you in church God wants you to pray God wants you to do all those things that have become religious in nature but truly\nGod wants you to live a life I'm\nA vet is filled every single day we'd creativity with exploration with curiosity and um for instance it says in scripture to pray without ceasing and truly it's it's it doesn't mean nonstop like a ...\nUm it it means kind of like an incessant cough\nIt means always be in that state of knowing that God is there and that you're thinking about God and that's kind of what you do with everything and and if you partake in something Charlie where you feel like how can I bring got into this and it doesn't quite work then maybe that's something that\nYou want to not do in your life yeah um yes\nI I had a question about like what about like uh go on to the like scary movies I mean it doesn't affect me like I don't think it's bad for like ... ... not giving already guy like if I were to go the scary movie\nWell it's what the purpose is there are many scary parts to scripture and I know the movies to picked a you know angels and demons as particular types of creatures but if you saw a good\nAnd Joel I'm it would creep you out at first the concept it's not the single pair of wing some angels have multiple pairs and wings or on their feet on their shoulders on their backs and there are things that would be\nQuite frightening as a matter of fact there are times in scripture where uh people were frightened of good angels or a godly experiences if\nYou put scripture\nOn camera and on film in a very articulate in legitimate way a there would be\nHorrible sex scenes there would be horrible scenes of violence there would be scary things there would be exciting things so really it's not about those things in general there's a whole psychology that surrounds the concept of\nA fear and why people like to be afraid and get scared when it's ... and that's why they go on roller coasters I'm a scary movie within reason\n[noise] ah is no different than going on a roller coaster or experiencing something else that would give you a thrill but it's the context of what's being done and the divide are really is if something's prescribing you to do something\nBad then you're not a part of it but if something is describing something bad then that's\nJust a description of things that are taking place or something that is a causing you to think about the way the world works or things like that so different people go see them for different reasons some people see them because they're movie buff so they're fascinated by the concept of a special effects or\nThe storyline or lately like the thrill of not knowing what's coming next but you could say that about a lot of things that\nYou know some people would think urban nine or ... you know some people think a Stephen King novels okay but uh uh Freddy Krueger movie is not or you know and go back and forth in these concepts", "show_name": "Our American Stories", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "28"}
