you're taking so now you don't have income supplementing that four O. one K. any longer and you're living on that for the rest of your life which can be twenty twenty five thirty years I think that's one important thing and then see how it can complement your Social Security I mean or or how your Social Security can\nComplement your four one K. and other out I think that's that's a great way to look at Oregon yeah yeah and we and we we do a lot of we do a lot of financial planning when it comes around that area sure\nIt's a complicated process isn't it said I mean this is not good especially when it comes to the distribution part of of retirement you know you're you're getting there you really need help with understanding how that money is going to be youth\n[laughter] yeah it's um um you know there are a few people\nA ... a smaller percentage of the American public that this is their hobby they really enjoy it they're good at their big investigators\nHey that's wonderful mhm you should do it yourself because remember Steve when you're working with a professional like myself there's going to be something that you pay for that advice for that investment advice or yeah I mean I mean we get paid for a service where there's a fee or a commission but there is some kind of cost and we want to make that worth your time\nTo go and hopefully with either\nThe possibility for better return of the possibility for less risk I mean we're trying to go in and match of what you want but you know what happens is is that you know one of the again I think this is a possible mistake but not Maxine out ear off or not ... or or your four one K. not matching those out so with your four O. one K.\nIf you're under fifty the age of fifty\nYou can put into up to Eighteen thousand five hundred okay and then you can catch up up to six thousand once you're fifty and over so ... that's twenty four thousand and five hundred dollars that if you want to max out your four oh one K. or your ... be or for fifty seven year plan\nIt may hurt a little bit right now\nCover and expenses but down the road so much more money to maybe pull it income from social I think that's one thing and then just Ross\nRoss IRAs and general most people here in Nebraska unless you're professional okay a business owner but there are limits on on on what you know building limit so in a rough IRA if you're single\nThe phase out starts at a hundred and twenty thousand at a hundred thirty five thousand you cannot it there's no benefit for the rough if you're married filing jointly hundred and eighty nine thousand is phase out in one Ninety nine after that then you can't do it so so if you're a higher income earner\nNo one's going to be pretty tough to go in and get the benefit of raw the for the majority of folks\nYes Ross contribution\nTax free after five years can really really makes it absolutely\nHey we've got a quick question how 'bout that okay good good great I'm sixty seven years old now and want to delay filing and receiving my Social Security benefit until I'm Seventy my wife has also sixty seven and she is a non working spouse who was not qualified to receive Social Security benefit on her own earning\nAnd she has not filed to receive a spouse will benefit should she filed to receive her spouse will benefit now or can she wait til she's Seventy years old to get fifty percent of my benefit let's break while yeah\nGetting very good question yet ... three key things here one is the wife\nThe spouse the the wife does not have a benefit so so she doesn't have benefit her own show as a spouse would benefit but he has to file first okay he has to file first violence a span is no longer available would help them back land but it's no longer available restricted application is but what happens is\nThat where you're taking he wouldn't be taking from espouse benefit she doesn't have one so you know what\nWe get what we need to do is just kind of run a Social Security port we have an eleven been the page report that will show you how to maximize but I Would put in what happens if he goes in and he files right now\nWhat if he goes in and files it's sixty eight nine or even as late as Seventy find out what's going to be that the ... the the the potentially the biggest most maximizing Social Security benefits so hopefully they'll call and I can help them with\nOur at that sounds great well by the way over the phone lines let anybody give us a call in and set up some time to come on and have a cup of coffee and then talk about it\nAll boils down

you know in second using thing because people do different things\nAnd uh and I I'm Betty how John witnesses\nAnd um I was quite their thing about that really brought a light to me that Sanford twenty ... that's a that it isn't there and then I think about it and think about it and I did research and things and um you know like for example\nOh that is hard that greeting card or they'll fight like Mother's Day Father's Day grandparents' day secretary's day and I ... in it them and that you know in in scripture kinda\nTake a Roman a Fifteen five I'm On the end of the subject\nBut really the heart that we don't live for ever well we have driven to the lord we if there whenever a we have served to God\nAnd that we do it and get things than shouldn't be checking our our brother that that we should get out and do the things that are are blatantly um\nSo are you worried about celebrating holidays\nBecause I I I'm I'm not so much worried about it I ... and I totally embrace ... is a blessing and and and did it best you can with it and you know everybody knew how they were you know in the Bible\nI won't tell you this there's nothing wrong with holidays are they the holy days of the past no I'm are a lot of them\nAre ... at ... at bare minimum embellished by the greeting card companies absolutely but that doesn't mean that you can't celebrate a mother or someone's birth or any of these things I think that uh\nThere are some groups or some may consider them fringe groups or\nThat or take this to a degree where they don't celebrate anything and it's a it's to me that is more militant\nAnd on Christian and the the attitude\nOf celebrating all things I mean for the ... uh five sixteen and Eighteen rejoice always pray without ceasing give things in all circumstances for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you there's\nThere's ... do you need a special day no but then you could say the same about the Sabbath you don't need a special day for that either it's just a matter of taking the time and\nAnd rejoicing and celebrating people and sometimes it's easier\nTo put something on the calendar or than it is because people put it off all the time\nYou do it with relationships of any kind you do it with friendships with getting together for coffee or tea or lunch or dinner or whatever it might be you put them off constantly\nAnd sometimes it's easier just to get something on the calendar and say this is the day that we're going to celebrate mothers or fathers or family or friends or whatever it might be\nAnd some of them may feel silly and you don't have to celebrate them and yes you can go back to the origins of Christmas and Easter and you can look that they weren't celebrated by the early church and of course I wasn't born in December\nUm it wouldn't make sense biblical ing based on what was taking place during the time on my birth all those things absolutely true however there's nothing wrong with taking a time\nPutting it on the calendar and the case of things like Christmas and Easter there were pagan holiday is during that time or the early church wanted to try and root those big on holidays out so they kinda plopped\nMy birth and my resurrection into those slots to try and squelch or squash the pagan a religious ceremonies or uh festivals for things like that\nAnd that was the way of the early church trying to kind of get their way I get all that but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't even matter there's pagan uh ties in\nUh when it comes to Christmas and it comes to Easter the the bunny rabbits the eggs all that stuff comes from pagan roots of the Christmas tree itself I'm is tied to pagan roots but it doesn't matter because that's not what people are celebrating\nAnd so to take a time of celebration to enjoy any more than people are celebrating you know pay guns on Halloween they're just not no kid is looking at the theological significance\nOf Halloween is thinking I get to dress up which kids love to do and run around\nAnd get candy for for a read\nThat's it\nNo theological you know and and I know that there's a lot of churches and Christian organizations that put on harvest dances or harvest events to try and sidestepped\nThe Halloween situation and holiday but the truth is that the harvest was an incredibly pagan a part of their ritual that's where the\nUh you know they were tied into the earth and to mother earth and its fruits and all of these things and and you just start looking for the devil under every rock and that doesn't help anybody so celebrating birthdays celebrating Christmas Easter the upcoming Halloween\nAny of these things are is fine it depends how you celebrate them you celebrate Christmas by you know you know killing a baby animal or probably not putting a smile and God's face\nBut if you enjoy family come together and hear music have food um praise God in the process there's nothing wrong with any of these days I think\nI think there's this attitude of this attitude of giving up things that people assume is automatically Christ like\nThat if you give up anything or you sacrifice something that it's Christ like and there are times where your call to give things up there's times where you are called to give up relationships were maybe move jobs or whatever it might be but that doesn't mean you need to sacrifice all the time\nThere was this young lady that I knew many years ago who was very devout and wanted to get\nI Am when guards kept up the angels down to earth ... ... ... ...

also there's also pre cycles that are much different than Christianity by far so ... and be careful not to confine them and just because there are similarities\nLast uh last week um we talked about counter fits and there gets to be a point where similarities don't mean the same uh they are counterfeit dollar bills that are very similar but I wouldn't try and pass them\nOkay but what I'm saying is when it got cut off your ankles landed in Atlanta or it could be five hundred years ago\nAnd the flight ... years ago and the nature and culture at the exact same thing in the scariest had all that

existed and were created enough out all the similarities in one marker all the difference is in a different\nShow every day you can see how it changed its migration distorted\nAnd it's following\nJesus came back the record straight because we were actually a couple of fish actually took our Bible because\nThere are theories are based on similar notions the problem is that uh the timeline is based on the timeline is when it becomes difficult when you're dealing with fallen angels\nAnd the concept of fallen angels are you talking about revelation twelve step in through nine talking about the battle with Michael in his angels fighting against the dragon or\nSatan\nThere's no specific time as a matter of fact when something's happening in heaven and that concept it's really outside of time so if you're using that as a basis to say okay we'll started here and there are similarities no doubt similarities may point to a\nStandards through point where you have a belief system starting\nHere moving through here some parts are taken some parts are removed some some of its polluted some of it's added to what have you I get that and that has most certainly taken place but to try and track trace it back entirely\nTo the fallen angels might be a little difficult from a historical or timeline perspective\nBut absolutely no doubt\nThat with the falling of the angels and the angels coming to earth as it says in scripture says in that very scripture revelation twelve step in the night talks about or that he was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him\nThat in that process that there there wasn't counterfeit and destruction and things that went along with it so I get the big picture of where you're going and how you look at it looks like here you had a face\nAnd then how you have those those that would be motivated to destroy that face\nCausing pollution and\nCounter fits in all these things that would twist it\nAround and that you say that you can kind of traced that back but I think there's you're dealing with other things that are outside the timeline of history\nAnd then within the timeline of history and that post is kind of a problem to figure out is to what took place when and where man stands in in that whole equation as well\n[noise]\nYour own person oh\nI'm On the here you forever to someone who share\nOur

Jesus show Jesus show Ken welcome to Jesus Christ show\nI ... when I was eight years old I'm I was a Christian camp a swimming in a lake and I watched the boy drowned right in front of me oh um it was a horrible traumatic incident that changed my life forever\nAnd\nNow I take it to\nBeing an adult I'm forty years old now and I decided to have my daughter baptized about two weeks ago and I got the directions to the lake\nAnd my daughter's very excited and I'm very excited however baptized them I drive in the same way that I Want to avoid around when I was exactly her age\nAnd\nAre kind of ... the whole incident and again and I was devastated I mean the odds of this happening of all the places that\nUm I could have had my daughter baptized that was exactly the same place that I watch this happen and you know I didn't know why this was going on I have mixed feelings about it maybe I shouldn't do it or maybe it's cursed um is this really what God's\nPlan is is ... ...\nA few years if you can you know I decided that you know this wasn't about me anymore about my daughter accepting Jesus Christ in her life and ... what happened um we decided to do it but I was wondering if there's any\nSignificance for the all\nWell I'll tell you ... ... ... first I'm very proud of you because you push through the enemy had you at every turn on that one he would have loved nothing more than you to\nTurn that car around and not have your daughter baptized it would've been a huge victory in his eyes and you push through it\nThere are a lot of things that are going to take place that you drive on roads every day that people have lost loved ones on every day you've done to hospitals where people have died you've gone to restaurants where people have been a it's gotten sick or might've choked on something\nDeath is a part of life it's everywhere but you need to see the significance of the incidents and what's taking place rather than than the fact that there's a history of something now if that child died because there was something in that water\nI wouldn't blame you but because of a freak accident or someone dying\nOr to not use the you know there's a reason that it's the same place this particular church or churches in general in that area may use this for you said it was a Christian camp or a a and now it's a Christian baptism\nThat they're just you know it's a body of water in the area it's it's normal for it to be used in different purposes but what I Want you to take from this is the fact\nThat things aren't evil unto themselves\nThere isn't an evil thing in the world\nEvil is when morally neutral things or have bad relationships so for instance when a child is in a unattended or doesn't swim well water can be evil in the relationship between that person in the water and they can drowned\nBut in a baptism that's controlled and are there are people around to watch and it's done structurally um it can be a beautiful thing about the awakening of someone's spirit and the acknowledgement of their face\nSo likewise if someone broke into your house heaven forbid with a gun that's a bad thing but if right behind them law enforcement broke into your house with a gun that's a good thing\nAnd so I Want you to stop you know not to see this lake is something good or bad it\nWas depending on how was experienced that was good or bad but the lake itself is not evil and it isn't cursed uh-huh or anything like that situation ... it's very sad that you had to witness that it's such a young age or at all and it's going to be a you know an indelible mark on your life forever\nBut I Hope that it will be equally as indelible the moment and the beauty of watching your daughter being baptized and confirm her place uh enter heart for God in front of all those people\nThat you should have power wouldn't you say\nYeah that that this [noise] I just couldn't believe that uh you know some good have come of it because I decided to\nBe a paramedic after that ... is\n... three of 'em so it did change my life forever but it also\nYou know after her being out of baptized I'll never forget that day in my life that was a day that just stood out to me and I felt that you know God was talking I mean I think it just\nWas really strange thing to go through what was he saying\nUm [noise] he was saying to let this go you were saying don't harbour any guilt it wasn't my fault you know I was a child and I and I didn't rescue him I I panic\nBut and you didn't have the ability to rescue him right I didn't so it can't be your fault\nAnd I and I took a long time to to realize that it wasn't my fault and uh\nBut just to let it go I mean just to say goodbye to him um to pray for him and\nI I I don't know I was just a really difficult thing to go through and be a paramedic I've seen people around a bit on the other side of it to 'em it was a really strange day\nI Want you to take all those the physical things and and seen some lose their life obviously very potent scripture says do not fear those that can kill the flesh but those that can kill the spirit and I want you to think about all those people that are grounding spiritually every single day because no one wants to do anything about it they're embarrassed to share their faith or whatever it might be\nAnd the situation you're describing is that you immediately grew into a person who said you know what I Want to know what to do and became a paramedic which you witnessed with your daughter was is you know the symbolism of\nOf baptism is the death in the burial and the resurrection\nAs they come up out of the water and I think all of that that imagery is very powerful but what you do with it is up to you ... you know the same knife you may use for a tracheotomy an emergency tracheotomy is the uh is a nice that can be used to kill somebody\nAnd just to not put value a positive or negative on these things the water the knife to any of these things but to see them as a proper usage and improper usage and what you got you got to see both in the same body of water\nAnd you got to see both sides of the beauty of that water and the power of that water in the sense of that it could take a life\nUm but to dwell on it or somehow I'm a letter weigh you down when it's obviously been a a you know positive or productive in your life piece of your life because you've taken it and said I'm going to do something good with it you have to let\nYou have to let the power of that lake\nOr the mystery of the lake go away but you don't have to forget what took place there you don't forget what you've learned there don't have to forget the life um but you couldn't do anything and guilt is irrelevant it doesn't mean anything that has no benefit in this particular case",
