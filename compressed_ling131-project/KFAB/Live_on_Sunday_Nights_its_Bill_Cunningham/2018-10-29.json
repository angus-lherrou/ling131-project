President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo or one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website\nIs filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day and in fact\nCNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know was a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses fascination\nOf Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveling hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and he was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter of frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio over the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent through about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice and like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print and if that doesn't fit and\nThen they don't print it if there was a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner on a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet\nAnd the media doesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent left us from in ...\nOther progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist and so I'm On the right\nCommitting acts of violence that is covered it completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite sat on a large rally that Jews are termites and thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites that is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically\nSo this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a few hours is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes ... hours has got to go the way it Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers\nWas a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nOh thing is disgusting when I get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis\nCaused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding in the southern border
