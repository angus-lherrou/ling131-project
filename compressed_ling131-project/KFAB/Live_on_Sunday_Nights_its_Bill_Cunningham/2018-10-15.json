Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson\nIn ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them\nPractically every chance they have ... ... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools\nFor generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led the massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who crippled the black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married\nIt goes on and on and on and this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause his sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control where well I've watched free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominant only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's gonna try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity\nAnd so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese are rise to any black who steps out of line\nThey're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work\nI have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee\nThe schools are completely dysfunctional that black families completely broken\nThere's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support for a different political outlook\nHe has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book because it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm\nCan you think a worst cities to live in one\nControl by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nWhen you think about how badly the Democratic party's treated blocks the relevant question isn't y con you realize that but why others have not realized why even more black voters at the same epiphany as Kanye West why as it had happened yet well maybe it is 'cause right now\nAccording to one poll thirty percent of blacks support the policies of Donald Trump how do you support the policies of Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton how do you support those policies that resulted in this massive failure of so many urban blacks\nThe odds of a black boy or girl being born into a black family where the mother and father\nAre married on the day that child's birth\nAnd still married Eighteen years later when that black board that black girl graduated from high school is under two percent the black family is destroyed by the policies of the modern Democratic Party and that is terrible consequences up and down the line\nLike short brake woman continue I'm going to play for you my interview with the president that I conducted on friday night about seven PM then later on also as Bill O'Reilly but uh\nI I like to hear maybe tonight from African Americans having tried this social experiment for the last six or seven years or ... marching lockstep with the Democratic party what benefits have you received\nWhere the jobs where's the educational achievement where's the family formation where are the communities free of crime and filled with the right kinds of arts and sciences that are\nPresent in other parts of America well what is the Democratic party done for African Americans that objective and discernible I think the answer is\nNothing so all Kanye West did on Tuesday was bring out the obvious which caused the avalanche of racism perpetrated by CNN Don Lemon\nAnd bakari sellers and terrorists admire and others to be employed against him to shut him up in marginalized him and this continued at night with Jimmy Kimble and others who said he was insane and an irrational madman snoop saying he's on ... Tom you got to shut them up\nOver Seventeen million kids in America may not know within the next meal coming from that one in five children yet billions of pounds of surplus food produced right here in America just gets thrown out every year and that's more than enough to see every last hungry child\nThat's mine Feeding America nationwide network has to get the hungry kids born\nBut they can't do it without your help\nAnd joined me in supporting Feeding America\nIn your local food bank by going to Feeding America die for\nTogether and we can knock out hung\nTogether we're Feeding America\nOn during your community and to find your local bank visit meeting America ... by Feeding America ...\nFrom my life changed because from what what's going to get this trend now when Congress and whether or not they've struggled with addiction and found people look at things about having someone who will come out and get better I mean I [noise]\nI knew how [noise] how much [noise]\n[noise] I mean I think I think that someone who is going to help make it better [noise] whether or not have struggled with addiction how people who understand no one can ...

got a call from the White House president would like to see you friday night what is in Cincinnati I said of course\nI wanted to go watch a high school football game with a relative playing but I thought well this is pretty important so on Wednesday I made a request to the White House to do a short interview\nWhich are the White House should said should be kept to about five minutes if it's granted I said okay actually turned out to be almost Fifteen minutes because the president and I had so much fun so I met the president in a hanger on friday evening\nAnd about an hour later he was going to go speak in a north of Cincinnati about thirty miles north of Cincinnati and Warren County\nAt a at a Republican gathering which twenty thousand people show up a little worn county while\nStanding in a field with light rain and cold dark\nAnd the sun was down it must have been forty forty five degrees the president let 'em up\nSo well on friday night the White House said no problem I met with the president did like eight Thirteen fourteen minutes interview and the references to about an hour for now relate to the what was going on in orange county and then yesterday Saturday he was in Kentucky and uh and beautiful and I think he did he told me off the\nOff air is going to be doing this three or four nights and the next three weeks and he said I got more energy about this than I've ever had so here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tighter headed\nFirst of all I'm is president welcome to Cincinnati thank you you have a long distance relationship here\nI Do I have had ... ships I had swift in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up [noise] we uh eleven\nHundred and sixty four year underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it by a garden that's right right but I should say I don't even know if it's still there are no\nAnd knocked it down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing is loading the garbage ... everything's on what's going to happen with it back in the housing development oh okay\nGood but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh\nIt was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all in the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it it's like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just\nHe literally just took off\nAnd he'll be at the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy right now about your wife is ...\nTrying to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very set in and out of the kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it just sits on a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just extra car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us\nBecause NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out I don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end we weren't able to make and I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is much much improved approved deals you know improved\nI Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise] it was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs and talking to my are we talking about Canada Mexico are we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs to potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to us if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab\nThey make a big deal if they have three hundred actually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it so we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a\nA piece of grain okay we want to send the piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start taxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not ever call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and interested that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately have a plan and came over and talk and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the we'd be able to find a way", "show_name": "Live on Sunday Nights its Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018",
