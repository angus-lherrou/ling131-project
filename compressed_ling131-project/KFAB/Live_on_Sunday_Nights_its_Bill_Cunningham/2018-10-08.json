Ramirez shaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job\nFor the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast of ... light away from a weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweat Nick nobody believed in fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote\nSome of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward\nBut at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple of girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape\nThis outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it plus uh\nAs far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\nI read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a ... this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin ... she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kevin O's line and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter\nMy sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns and Van Dyke Perry\nWho spent a combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate in other words there\nAre uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and show you where we are\nSteven ... of the Late Show as a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening\nAerial doom is aerial do much as a writer on Stephen cold bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh's life unquote\nYou see this was never about finding the truth about professor Ford she was used like a three dollar steak by a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that you wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe\nIt is unbelievable ... and this writer for the CBS Evening show Stephen Colbert Errol do most says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin am for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they were walking the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized to vote than we've ever been goes to the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take

States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold bake it in the night\nShe was brilliant going over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees on the U.S Supreme Court and\nI'm so proud of a bread Kevin all his wife his mom and dad as girls\nAnd what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault\nThan most likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media\nPractically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses including her real version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for re election in two years\nBut she ought to but now a clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett\nSpun gossipy famed to run against or in Maine have asked\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party pornography industry if you don't made sure yeah\nDo you know the Democrats claim to care about women but over the years or one of their largest supporters has been the pornography in the street I'm just wondering if they're really cared about when the why do they take money from these people who like women that way\nAbout Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I I think you did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against Trump\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they did have one criminal prosecution against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars to the Democrats along with the abortion industry\nSo killing babies in sub spaghetti women July first\nThe actual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women than their leader would not be\nThe U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee in ... if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to women these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nOr if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten is correct\nBut every now and then you have the Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turn out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth and she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys\nAnd her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties\nAnd the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh\nIt's because he was one boy\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fib that it was Kevin all but the but the notes of the therapists clearly indicated it could not have been Brett Kavanaugh you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when Israeli or left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for\nSuddenly it was in her late teens that was Fifteen suddenly one in the mid Nineteen eighties it was Nineteen eighty two she had to change your story in order to fit Brad Kevin Hall\nThat clearly indicated to me that she was mistaken at a minimum and probably line Let's continue is Brian from Indianapolis Brian in Annapolis welcome to the bill Cunningham show Brian go ahead\n[laughter] hey well gaming how are you a great day to being an American\nYesterday yesterday hey listen I got I got several liars in the fire and if you fair with me I'll get 'em all out here man and you and we'll we'll hashing them all out first thing I I you know I listen to Susan Collins speak that she gave wonderful excellent and and it was very truthful\nOkay Number two my my little sister is a victim of a sexual assault that would have turned into a rate if not been here for ... that showed up and this was back in Nineteen eighty one\nOkay never and I had some disagreements when when the doctor was hit her testimony in front of the committee\nAfter the fact that all come out the FBI investigation even my little sister who told me you know why don't you believe what she's saying I think I Believe for her but she has a lot of inconsistencies\nAnd that they're all of this she has come to the conclusion also that she had a lot of inconsistencies and get the bully she believes something happened to her but you don't believe it happened when Brett Kavanaugh was\nRunning or what happened to her was a therapist notes for boys tried to write for her she was in her late teens and the mid Nineteen aid that happened and that doesn't fit Brett Kavanaugh but she projected his face on those four boys because it fit or a political opinions\nMarket across team was it yeah La Crosse team ... boys in Boise got accused at the
