Ohio\nWe don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals coming ... most violent places on earth we don't want that hey is this playing well in Connecticut\nAnd\nConnecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high

current uh current boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also how can Obama drone American citizens like this Ella we eat guy kill them all up\nYou know trial no jury electrocution and then the media doesn't saying you know they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and and it's because you know ... ... ... in in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club or against Trump they'll do it\nBut ... out of wacky being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by not a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone a composite or killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact\nThat ... that kind of behavior not part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much\nBut I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia and then when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists and then I hear about the show again as if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why is his wife more valuable than a cubs life\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayer says the same I end up look at the head of the past set of who's back to stand against the oil as political opponents right both Porsche and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed the face their supply Afghanistan\nPlus services African Business conference that Obama held\n... fifth the African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR\nThey just fall under over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background\nOf this desk fought for Chris African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr no ... and you went over that quickly but use Pakistan had a leader\nWho would boil alive is political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replacing footing around with this guy and the media ... that was no big deal right to boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama\nHad the relationship and Heller had the relationship and use ... than the media didn't cover that are all did they\nKnow and you know it's funny there are people on NPR that work to our to our to our show every week and and they make three hundred\nThousand dollars plus she's here now see that's fine except I don't want to subsidize it you know ... you know why should we pay for NPR PBS but you know like Facebook and Google and Microsoft Starbucks and Amazon\nLet them pay for it or people that like it in San Francisco or Boston but why is the average ... horrible taxpayer half the subsidized in the yard that the clowns they have one that that station on a regular basis with their mobile fire as a propaganda\nAnd then there's hundreds hundreds of rent their ears and thousand radio stations there's five hundred television stations but we taxpayer subsidized PBS and NPR for what reason what what's the purpose is because they're left wing liberal Democrats and the Republican Party has no ... that's why it's done right\nWell I'm not for killing people but I mean hell no words you don't like it is not a nice after utopian world is like\nBrick set it in a cost to walk I Do my wife is very cheap around the world and you know but people who pick and troops there atrocities and their best spots or should be kept
