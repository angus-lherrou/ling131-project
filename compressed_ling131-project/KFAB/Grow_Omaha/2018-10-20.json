think if you're worried about your country like you need to make certain that they feel vested near society and have a hope\nThat they're not excluded from from the game so I don't think we're thinking enough about that as for the middle class that's why we elected Trump because no one's paying attention to their concerns you know it was all the you know worshipping corporate CEOs and the average person so far from that\nThat they resent it and they should raise it a good point there\nWho does that goes right back to him understanding history and and at the same time being forward thinking which they really kind of go hand in hand so yeah this this whole middle class you got to know if you're a retiree with respect to the middle class if and people that are younger than you if you're sixty five year old\nYou have probably already heard this a Social Security administration is going to reduce Social Security benefits to you as a current recipient or in like twenty thirty three are some studies say twenty Seventy seven because it's already broken ... in other words are already unfunded our Social Security\nBeneficiaries are taking dollars that are coming straight from paycheck from the fifty year old and it's going in the front door and run out the back door to you okay that in other words there's no surplus with the Social Security so one of the things that he was talking about\nIs that if we don't have a strong economic base where we have people going to work and paying taxes and in addition to that paying of course Social Security tax we don't have any Social Security yourself to your Social Security currently is dependent upon the current economy\nAnd current employment rates and current participants in the bank Social Security\nDepartment itself and funding that thing\nSo thank goodness that we have this newly thriving economy right now which is beginning to bolster the Social Security department and perhaps stretch this out for a few more years so that you don't have a twenty five percent reduction in your own Social Security\nOr in the year twenty you know twenty seven or ... you know thirty three or whatever is going to be\nThat's a big deal and so in addition to that just the youngsters coming along meaning the thirty five year old ... for their willingness to go to work or their willingness to do what it takes to understand what's going on in this country in this economy and in this world and what has really has made America great\nIs paramount and that's what he's talking about and that piece\nYou know when we talk you're on the show it's typically about retirement and we did want to address part of that with Tucker right there on the set of Fox News as we talked about different things affecting our country and we just don't hear all the time in in Tucker's actually on the same page the new reality in retirement\nIs that most of us don't have the same type of retirement our parents had\nEspecially pension that America\nThat's gone and increasingly the trend is almost universal this point is to offload\nYour labor costs onto taxpayers and you see huge companies do it all the time I mean if you know huge percentage your employees are on food stamps what are you really sad and you can afford to pay the more but you are you're saying taxpayers are taking up the slack on behalf of shareholders politicians don't seem anxious to address this question at all\nIt seems immoral to me speaking as a citizen but um again only the crazies wing Bernie Sanders and a few people on the far right ever say anything about it\nA pension problem Israel Daryl and there's some great companies don't Omaha that have tensions and that are doing great and you help those people all the time\nWell we do it's it's it's interesting to me when I see people coming in with pensions because I Know the statistically in the workforce only Fifteen Percent of the workforce has a pension\nWhere as a large percentage of the people who come into my office have pensions but the reason for that is because I'm I'm working with all the older people and so these are the leftovers these are the people these the dinosaurs these are the people who have pensions they might have a lot of times we have people with a four one K. or two and a pension\nAnd maybe a couple of inches I mean I've had people come in with multiple pensions\nSome two or three different pensions from the same company because the structure but these are people that are sixty five Seventy years old these aren't people that are thirty five if you're thirty five years old\nHave the company's back in a Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty in Nineteen eighty one when the four one K. was popularized that was when pensions went away because companies could see that they were not going to be able to continue to fund\nThese what we called defined benefit plans that which means exactly what it sounds like the benefit meaning the amount we're going to pay you at retirement has been defined\nAnd then I'll have to do is figure out a way to do it okay but they could see that they're going to have problems so the onus was passed to the employee and it says you know just do four one K. through a few bucks at him and let them figure it out and so\nThat's where we're at now and yeah so\nYeah so you need to set up your own income streams on your own which is what we do\nAnd also if you have a four one K. if you had a pension if it's an Iran mutual fund however you've invested for retirement and they're all in the ... retirement strategies if you're over fifty five year exactly who they help with those issues and more it's about having income in retirement you've done the hard work you said he's invested\nHow is that going to create income

it was it was a really remarkable day or to see the kind of energy that's going to be created in and really what several years ago was sort of a no man's land between master\nCraft and coming street so it it is very very exciting\nOh yeah and I think one of the biggest challenges to your team has to have David is keeping track of all these amazing districts were doing nothing out at the capital district the con agra development the civic the builders district ... district\nYeah hard well at AT T which headquarters in because he I mean there was a great graphic in the in the paper the other day that that showed um just in this area alone to the Santa Francis house complex of improvement that was announced this week uh the ... district the future for peace the the key with he would project\nAnd a lot be mean those are all basically from tenth street to fourteenth street and from say a cast\nStreet to to Nicholas and that's a really small confined space with hundreds of millions of dollars being spent including a fortune five hundred corporate headquarters building and you know it it it's really a remarkable mix of uses and uh I think it's going to become one of those more dynamic places you know ma\nYeah it'll be one of those places uh ten years from now or where people come visit and they'll be like wow I didn't realize they had stuff like\nThat on Damascus will think about what this just kind of carry forward ten years from now right I'm riverfront will have been developed the whole river from the development project that we've all talked about before\nI Will be done the kind of agra redevelopment will will be done lot be will likely be re done or the ... the the ... district will be done future forward will be done no do basically will be done\nIt's going to be a different change the face of this community I mean that area if you if you disappear today and then come back for ten years you're wondering what in the world what city do you do come back to you the last ... and that's what it's like today when people haven't been here for ten years they come back and wonder holy cow but what has gone on this community so we're we're blessed to see\nThis continuation of public private partnerships where you have great investors like like the Smith are working with the city who's got some skin in the game again on on the infrastructure side of things and making this this deal work through tiff and other things\nVirtually all of those projects that we've just described have some partnership between the the philanthropic community the private sector and the public sector and we continue to make those work as a community so uh it's it's just fascinating to see these projects kind of evolve and become a reality\nYeah well I'm an ex up on the docket um\nWe've got a United Airlines is adding a third daily non-stop flight from Epley airport\nTo Newark liberty international airport courses the New York city airport I Believe we still have nonstop LaGuardia do on different early but if you would have a you talk about till waking up ten years later I'm if if you would have told me Twenty years ago that we would someday have three daily nonstop to to Newark and\nDaily nonstop to LaGuardia I Would have had to pinch myself well\nThink about this there's forty one nonstop locations now forty one that's amazed when I got here there were nine that ends impressive so you start thinking about what they're really means that you can get just about anywhere you want to get to know what this shows me is is our next iteration so getting the nonstop says one thing\nGetting multiple non stops gives you calendar flexibility ... allow the nonstop so we have if you want to find nonstop there's a fight there and fight back and if it doesn't fit your calendar then you're going into the late ... lane over somewhere\nStill we can do it but it is less flexible now when we're starting to say guess what we're having multiples on the same airline to the same location everyday\nNow you're really starting to give people choices and and that's really going to make a difference in people saying boy we're we're getting big city airline capabilities here I'm In a market that is much easier to navigate\nWell you know and I I travel out athlete probably three or four times a month and one of the things I've noticed when you look up at the board nowadays\nIt's it's interesting to see the diversity of cities you\nKnow whereas it used to be Chicago Denver Chicago [laughter] Dallas on it and I you know it's it's nice to see that diversity of cities and and the the three non stops at a day to New York city and nonstop to Philadelphia and then all these other places that we never used to have\nI Love the fact you can go to any coast that you you go to either coasts you can go south you can go north you can you can literally get any good sized city in in this country pretty easily from here now and that's a that's a that's what I Love to see on the sign is like you say there's no there's forty different locations on on the board now rather than just a handful\nYeah I think I have to add another TV screen [laughter] did a couple of yeah [laughter] ...\nYou know now of course they're starting to pre planning for the terminal expansion 'cause we were seeing all the construction that's going on in the rental car facilities\nThe the huge parking facilities that they're building out there um the the next step of course is getting that hitting that number for a new meaning to redo the terminal so the terminal starts feeling like a\nA a larger city terminal with all the ts the TSA stuff in the middle and gates on both sides and it's something you would see kind of indifferent airport so that's that's the next step and that that design work is starting interests so I that's a really good sign I think\nAnd and I tell you what that has to be getting somewhat close because\nThere are times a day where those two doesn't matter whether you're in the north satellite terminal or the south satellite terminal your shoulder to shoulder and there yeah and then your time time as tight as a write in time which is a good sign up and er and speaking of that you know the other nice thing when they when they have one big long term mental connecting north and south\nI think the big thing that a lot of travel travelers will appreciate will be better restaurant selection and yeah and that's\nOne of our big I think one of our big challenges is it is\nLet's just say not not putting our best foot forward if you're having this to stay in and get their really get nowhere to eat nowhere to drink um you know they're they're ... to the gills as they are and basically they're they're kinda glorify Delhi's in jail and we need to have a um a higher caliber of food a higher caliber of\nWaiting areas higher caliber of choices really an even retail that you find in other words that we expect to see here and that's that's the next big iteration at that airport\nIt'll become and it'll become and if I Do notice when I ever I fly in late at night um there's always about four or five or six Southwest Airlines planes that are stacked up part north of the terminal sudden you know they they're they're they're they're keeping enough of them overnight that they can't park them all at the gate and so you're seeing those good signs\nWhen I I think we're seeing all the right science you're absolutely right if they're if they're loading their planes here at night because they got early flights out of here in the morning that they got to service\nA I mean the planes coming in here in in in a broadening the timeline within which they leave\nAnd they come that's gonna mean you're going to want to have more amenities available at the airport later or so I I think we're all hit in the right direction\nI I we I'm we'd been impatient as as you know and so I mean I'd like to see them start construction on on the terminal as soon as they get the parking and Reed Martin rental and downright I'm so start letting the bits now isn't that close but it certainly is getting closer\nYeah well speaking of transportation and travel um the Nebraska tourism logo has ... [laughter] as the new slogan has raised some eyebrows I'm honestly it's not for everyone that is the ... the new Nebraska tourism a slogan honestly it's not forever\nAnd you forget you had to put the word Nebraska before that yeah so [laughter] so yeah it it um [laughter] we're not terribly enthused by it um\nI ... prefer typically sense we are trying to make the case that um this is a place that everyone can be successful that everyone can have a good time that\nEveryone can feel welcome and when your slogans says yeah not so much um [laughter] they tend to counterbalance as you're all impression that come on and we're a great place for everybody but didn't yeah and and so I I uh our our our marketing and brand people have spent a good bit of time this week kind of analyzing their\nUh their brand statement their narrative the brand itself and\nIt it seems like um they have tried to take a page from we don't coast where\nWe've got to be a bit edgy little contrarian um but if you you don't really go oh my God did they really say that when they say we don't coast I mean we had a couple of people were concerned about are we um\nWith we don't coast are we telling people on the coast we don't want them a buddy ... oh you have to do is think about we don't cause for\nSplit seconds and you understand you know what it's all about I'm not so sure you get that same feel one basically you're saying the brass ... yeah maybe not for you [laughter] so I ah I I'm I'm I Know there's an awful lot of social media Hangst about it um I think the tourism department has taken this this\nUh any mentioned in the newspaper of our slogan has a good thing\nUm we've actually analyze the good and the bad comments about that and this predominantly a looked askance at so but we're not\nI I suppose is I'm not sure if it's a better than ever ask a nice we weren't happy with Nebraska nice either nor was I um\nYou know obviously we're not making that decision the tourism commission decides there's the term commission is an independent commission that um is this not report to the governor reports to a commission and has its own director and so they're they're\nAnd so it's an important corner plus I think the the ... the twelfth and Ernie I'm corner of the house she has me the thirteenth and Howard corner I'm going into the market is just as exciting and important and so we gotta make sure that both half that half of that block are activated the way they need to be\nWell the great ... economic development partnership which is a a centrally part of of the chamber and leads or economic development activity here for the multi county metro area a lot of success so far this year David\nIt's been a great year I mean we've in the third quarter you know we open thirty nine I'm\nA new projects um we had Thirteen companies come visit\n'em including you know ten calls on local companies that have projects and I'm ... open or actually about forty new startup fellows that are going through our started clarity process so it is man or a remarkable quarter and this year you know we're we're doing great will will hit we've already at the job number\nWe we a bone pass five fold the investment number and the number of project numbers will be really close to a year and so as we wrap up the last\nYear of prosper Omaha one point you know and start moving in their prosper Omaha two point oh no I'm Willa Willa blown past all of our numbers that we had set out to try and make sure we're causing capital investment jobs that happened in this community\nSo tell me about blueprint Nebraska what's that\n[noise] so about a year and a half ago maybe um we was pretty clear that we really didn't have a a comprehensive statewide economic development strategy\nAnd uh in the past all those strategies had men basically instigated by state government so they hired Patel about ten years ago to come in and just sort of a cluster analysis\nI'll be hired Sri that come in and do a target industry and now it's just a few years ago but the more we looked at lower realized that it really wasn't something that was a a true strategy that worked across the state\nAnd it had very limited business input into the last one and frankly I think under\nEstimated the role that universities can play in our in our market so University of Nebraska president hang bounds who had gone through a similar process like this when he was the Mississippi um came to us and say we think we can put this this primarily private sector group together\nOr we got the support of it and the governor is involved in the process it's independent of\nState government but he is a partner in it as as Hank bounds\nIt's a committee of Twenty one business people led by Lance Fritz for music Pacific and own palms from twenty first century um industries in ...\nAnd then there's not Nineteen other steering committee members they've created sixteen industry counsels to look at every facet of a development in the state from education to health care to transportation to work for us to diversity and inclusion to\nBanking and finance taxing incentives and it it's a huge effort each of those is led by a business person as well and the the council's each have\nA diversity of people from across the state and then each of those councils also have staff people I'm half of them are actually being led by staff from the ... chamber\nUm others are being led by ... Lincoln chamber and the state chamber so it's an effort that will probably take a through next June or to probably have a a report that says here's where we go next\nI suppose there's a lot of meetings going on around the state and a lot of effort to try and build day long term strategy that will recognize our strengths are turned solve our weaknesses into sell selling points and I'm\nTrying to take us to the next level really instead of sort of floating along let's figure out where we want to be what we want to be and what the action inception necessary to guess there\nI'm Talking with David Brown president and CEO of your great grandma chamber of commerce we're going to take our mid our break but when we come back we have a list of about twenty things to come over with David so you don't want to miss any of this a lot of interesting or talk\nYet to come here on ... today were brought to you by any I impede dodge commercial real estate and ... and M roofing back in the moment a news radio eleven ten K.
