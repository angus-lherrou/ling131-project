I'm Sorry they knew what the advisory if he was a few across the table they're working with an adviser okay\nWho wasn't doing really anything but throwing money in a in some mutual funds okay so they're paying their advisor you know say one person and then they're paying for the mutual on this couple was paying over Nineteen thousand dollars per year in ... and ... okay I have this conversation with him I said listen\nMost people if you're a listener I can assure you it's something you should consider okay that\nYour fees that you're paying on your investments will say you have six seven hundred thousand dollars laying around whatever a million dollars or something like that\nThe fees that you are paying on that let's say that you're paying a C C a million dollars let's just say and you're paying you know one point five percent so you're paying Fifteen thousand dollars per year okay that's twelve hundred fifty bucks a month okay it is probably one of the biggest bills that you have and you don't even realize you're paying and you know even you don't even know you had that bill\nGosh it's crazy you you would not go to a mechanic\nAnd not kind of get some kind of a quota you know let me know what the charges before you before you do anything so I Know if I Want to do it right\nYou would do the same thing if you're getting I mean if you're going to have a surgery you know and selective thing you say well okay I think what's our deductible blah how much is the thing you would do the math you figure out what it is you would wonder how much the the us you know the cable company\nIf they're going to try to call for coming out you are you you're going to charge me forty dollars just to come out and push a couple of buttons are you kidding me and you get all upset about that\nCome on I mean that is nothing compared with what you're probably paying in your investment fees and you have no idea what they are\nThat's why we got to get informed about this and that's why it's important that we talk about if you're on the show so that listening at home you can at least be proactive enough to really dig into whatever investment accounts you have and really they don't just do a quick glance by on what you're paying make sure you know all of the fees that you're paying and nothing is free I get that\nBut that's why you just need at least make sure it's worth it for what you're getting if you need assistance with that Darrell can do the x-ray on any type of investment that you have\nAnd he can show you what it is that you're paying now and see if that still makes sense for you based on them returned that you're getting or you can find out if there are some other things out there you should be looking at that\nAt least an informed about those fees with that the X ray and now there isn't a charge for the the X ray but obviously Darryl isn't it either so if you work with him that's how he ultimately\nMakes money and it runs the office and continues to be a resource to the community of Omaha we've got some spots available in the coming weeks all you have to do is call for zero to nine three two two one for a while that's four zero to die in three two two one for one and you can can act as well as deep Bryant retirement strategies dot\nI'm Christian trials on behalf of Omaha retirement strategist Dale Bryant in the entire team thank you so much for making retirement strategies radio\nOf the weekend on his radio eleven ten K.

for a ... percent because\nIf you're going to the Blackstone in area it's a cool fun area it's it's it's got energy that is kind of palpable when you're walking around at the restaurants are particularly good\nAnd the ... and it's kind of going out place and and if you go there for like I actually probably go there for lunch far more than dinner or because I'll have meetings down there and it's just as good enough that you just you just don't mind\nPeople work hard and we spend their money and that's an ... an old it's work the system works\nWell hopefully the Blackstone is full speed ahead then because that will be um I don't think we can overstate the impact that will have on midtown and really I don't know how I was a whole to have that upscale grand historic hotel that it seems like every other city but us has\nThey have a pool club I I think that to really keep it a authentic I think they should go back in and do like synchronized swimming troop like the the Blackstone in a synchronized swimming the\nBlackout in synchronized troop yeah him well known men and women are you going to be captain of the team I mean All right I'll ... think swimming that would be fun All right I'll do the triple India vivid hiding the diving board\nOkay okay some tells me the the liability insurance won't quite allow that but uh if it does all I'll definitely be on the front row with my cell phone camera on\nWell we got a note today from earlier this week from ... life and uh\nA person from metlife set I just wanted to keep you updated on ... life's progress in Omaha our first wave of associates are starting in the gavel on building in downtown Omaha this week it's an exciting time for us in the space\nAnd we wanted to let you know we're on track to hire approximately one hundred and sixty five jobs and looks like they've chosen a leader of that office she's relocating Omaha\nFrom elsewhere or the state of the art space is ready to go it's um ... words as those were elsewhere according to metlife it's um innovative and creative or the atmosphere so anyway it looks like a met life's a president that downtown all the house full speed\nAhead as well that's great good job growth ... does that mean gambling will stay in that building then that's what it sounds like ... that really nice trading floor and everything is too big of a building it sounds like\nYeah well I think gamble on overbuilt the building in in case they needed it for expansion and apparently to this point have not and uh\nUm so it made sense I presume the uh I don't know whether it's a sublease arrangement or or not but it probably makes sense to have the space filled and it's great that life is a great company to have in the business we've\nStarted with that over the years that ... in art market\nThere's a few landlords or or companies that have to have space available in order to grow our market you know yeah you know it it sucks for the owner of a building of its empty and there's no income coming in but at the same time we're having such so much growth with existing companies new companies that that space gets filled\n[noise] hey I'm you know speaking of that when not so much on the on the office right but on the industrial front I was looking through some of the construction bed invitations that were emailed out to construction subcontractors you're on the list [laughter]\nReally to dodge reports in that kind of on that list I was going to say I've got people saying okay um and so I'm\nAt any rate uh it looks like you know our in our built a big nice warehouse\nOut on long highway fifty nice on the south or three Seventy it looks like a they're about ready to start a second one that I don't know if they feel the first would really much just like it though they're putting out beds for a second one\nAnd the industrial vacancy now is they are saying this quarter sub three percent\nSo this is a big office buildings that are long highway fifty and then I'm just two buildings\nOh sorry industrial buildings in data centers and all kinds of stuff but but um ... express are also known as the brass courthouse um the Myers family built to really nice like a hundred and eighty thousand or so big buildings but a hundred and fifty six and gold coast road which would be\nKind of on the interstate kinda by um say I eighty and highway three Seventy and we can from that\nUm Amazon took sixty thousand feet for like ... like the last I don't know if it's the same day delivery or in the last stuff because we can sit here where I have a trial or whatever yeah whatever they call it and then they're also in Harvey has has at least a hundred and Fifteen thousand feet is waiting\nWhen they figure out how to do a home delivery right\nUm they are doing in Des Moines already\nWhere they're doing it at the moment it's called the dark store we've talked about it where they have but rather than a getting your mom's way and and your way when your grocery shopping up their stores what they're doing now is they're pickers there and putting in trucks to their stores\nThey want to have a dark store where there's no customers doesn't have to be as fancy and then they fill the trucks and distribute\nStill getting your mom's way when you go grocery shopping or how you know as well as well you know the the problem is trying to get me out of the shopping cart [laughter] um [noise] neither draws in life to get a [laughter]\nAnd I'm an old welding ... we did a job to live in Iowa three\nWe've gotten emergency here folks um [laughter] at any rate uh let's let's let's move past that visual you are on the planning board and did you have a meeting this\nWeek about a year left um we're meeting a Wednesday\nThis coming Wednesday we just had one yeah okay so yeah so I thought so you had looks like you guys were kind of busy I'm\nNow voted seven oh to declare the controversial building at four twenty south Eighteenth street\nThis is the one that would possibly be removed for juvenile detention in all those interest just wait wait until I got to tell her when I got to lead up before we get your a Pepsi commentary\nUm that are you guys have to decide to declare it are recommended that it should be the council um or the city council should but you guys recommended it should get landmark status yeah tell us about this\nWell here's a building now me and some of my fellow colleagues you know we're talking you know before the meeting and we didn't have high hopes for this building now\nI was I had lunch with Ryan bumped into used to work with us and and the bachelor the ... and and he is sold a bill into and out of state buyer for like three hundred and twenty thousand dollars and we know that was like simply boarded up on the first couple\nOf floors with with your ... when the Army Corps of engineers used and it was like a testing laboratory laboratory and you didn't see the great windows that exist to this thing was built to be\nAuto dealerships and all the repair shops multi story\nUm for a long time and a Bob Peron who's an architect has done this before the other buildings um\nCame and made a very good presentation and visually showed us with the building looks like and they're you know there's neighbors from the fighter and all these places like that testified that they they didn't even know this building existed because like hiding in plain sight you know if you take they they are they I enrolled panels and and covered up all the windows or anything else\nBut if you looked at the building and what ... what he can and will be if it stays\nThen it it's it's really a nice gentleman I was I was really thinking who cares about this building\nAnd then through the half hour presentation and and the the people that are testify everything else in and actually we um\nWe voted to to to keep it in in recommend keeping it to the city council and the proponents actually gave us a a an ovation\nAnd I said as it should be standings they got up and they give us a standing ovation or she would say that we've never had that before and um but no I felt good about it and and and I know that there's members of the\nThe county board that fryer unhappy but but at the same time you know and then mayor stop their weight and then she gets final on the bond she has to approve the bonds Riley and she went and looked at the current facilities of war or worse than forty second or something like that and it sounds like there's plenty of room over there and stuff and I haven't I haven't investigated anything\nElse on the mayor was on cafe be caught it on Cape May be saying the exact same thing that she was quite surprised how good the current facility yeah\nBut yeah I I come down on that I'm Glad you guys go to the way you did what what I Am in favor of is ... put the tend to twelve story\nA court house building right across the street from the Douglas County courthouse save this building that you and your colleagues just voted to recommend landmark status and keep the juvenile detention thing out where it is and spend a fraction of that money to upgrade it\nUm and it seems like that's kind of a win win win right so we get a better juvenile detention center out there we do get the courthouse right across the street from the current court house and we get a twelve story building out of it which and all the halls significant and then and then uh that other building can be renovated and whatever and then it won't it won't kill that nascent district down there that has a lot of potential\nSeeking beforehand that we could we could say okay we'll keep the building but you got to put the juvenile detention center in it [laughter] I don't think it'd be it probably wouldn't be the most efficient juvenile detention center now but um you know it's it's the one thing I like about public\nBuildings and and they showed a beautiful glass and in modern building and I'm sure there's efficiencies and all kinds of stuff and municipalities seem like they can spend more money than private contractors and you know these buildings will help shape our\nOur downtown and everything else but it'll be interesting to see what happens in in you know it's it's out of our hands now after ... will have to watch is with the with the city council doesn't and with the county board and the mayor does\nWell that is your economic development news of the week brought you buy eagle mortgage eagle mortgage company dot com or you can find them in person\nRather than someone else managing it and and just putting a name on the side of a building letter\nBut there's something else that I think is interesting about them one as they are very much interested in the economic development of this region and they're investing in that but at the same time they're very interested in the individuals that they're helping\nIf you are to sit in a lunch were Carl mammal is meeting with this scholarship students\nAnd just sit and listen not say anything at all you'd understand very quickly that he genuinely cares about the students he cares about their lives and their future and that sort of thing and I think they're investing in that at the same time right and so as personal as an end and general at the same time and that's what makes it so exciting to watch\nSpeaking of those individuals ah Lou what is the enrollment like these days um how is it grown what are the what's the biggest major in college [noise]\nWell um we\nWe have cyclical enrollment as we've had throughout our colleges history universities had a a history of cycles as well\nSo we had been up and uh so you've read the most recent enrollment data and you know that we've had a slight downturn\nBut from two thousand twelve and two two thousand Seventeen we'd a pretty significant run up and enrollment\nAnd that was for a lot of different reasons I'm part of the part of it's driven by some I think excellent new programs that we've added you asked about those uh one of them in particular is in supply chain management I mean this is a program we started four and a half years ago\nUm and we had zero students now we have a hundred students and the most impressive thing about this is I I Love this at graduation\nWhen I Know that students who are graduating\nWith are already have a job and had a job offer long before they graduated it just gives me an extra smile on my face every student that's graduated from that program so far has had a job before they walked across the stage and these are jobs that are good paying jobs to this is really really exciting\nWhen you add programs like that you have dynamic faculty or you have lots of good things going on great partnership with the business community all of that comes together and then now we have a a you know we have lots of exciting job of staying in a long\nThey are and the one one thing that I I Want to point out is the fact that\nUnlike some situations in some other parts of the country when our students graduate from our College of business\nThe preponderance of them over Ninety percent are going to stay here in Ohio at least in the very beginning after they start their careers that's pretty significant in terms of economic development I mean we always had these discussions with had these sketches were long time\nAbout the low unemployment rate not having enough people with the right kinds of skills and that sort of thing\nWe're doing the best job that we can to to help our city uh along those while we desperately need them\nDr Paul does that mean that um the ... companies that have been a major major president Omar Al Gore to hear that they're buying into the program and they're doing internships and they are helping you with your curriculum\nAbsolutely um and they're wonderful partners and and you mentioned internships are\nThat's the key for student uh in terms of the transition from being a student to being a full time employee\nIf if a student will take an internship they have a serious increase in in their chances to even make choices too so that Seventy percent of the students that we have who have internships\nAre offered fulltime jobs in those places they don't always take them but they are offered those jobs and we've seen this connection for a good while in the business community is great about wanting to be part of this in one of the ways they do is they understand that our students have really odd schedules because all of them work\nThey have internships these are paid internships and they're trying to balance their family and their scores were all this kind of stuff and so they're amazingly flexible and the hours that they offered the students and and make it possible for them to do that and the same time they're getting on a they're getting a try out\nA for someone who is probably pretty good and then they get to make the decision to that want to keep them\nAround is really a self fulfilling prophecy for companies to get involved in it and get employees\nLou can we stick around for a little bit longer after we take this quick break ... okay All right ah that's a doctor loophole dean of the College of business administration put break back in a moment a news radio eleven ten K. if maybe\nThe biggest music
