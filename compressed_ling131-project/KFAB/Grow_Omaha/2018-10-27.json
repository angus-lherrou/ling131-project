{"month": "10", "state": "NE", "station": "KFAB", "content": "Horrific drop a fifty percent okay in other words the Dow fell fifty point nine five percent pick the trough two thousand and two thousand seven but when we grew prior to two thousand seven on the decline we still had not recovered to the level we were at two thousand\nAh two thousand we're in an all time high it was an all time high\nWe declined and we climbed back up to two thousand seven eight nine that was not a full recovery at\nDeclined again fifty one percent and then it finally went up from there but to get to where you were to get for the for the level of this and ... to get\nTo where it was at an all time high meaning historical all time high year two thousand it was fourteen years okay so imagine if you're sixty years old and if I'm not saying we will but if\nWe experience that decline and you're say sixty years old okay you want to go to Seventy four till you're back whole okay when you know you need right you're going to need to use these dollars okay\nSo it's really really important to a new to use your head\nAnd to think of you is what could happen and\nIf I already have it and made why would I\nBe putting everything at risk right now when I have it and made here's the problem that's going on in the stock market people say why why are we going down what's the deal well it's a combination of things we really can't put our finger on it\nThe geopolitics are issues that are going on a all across the world there yeah a lot of tension you have us bond yields are going up which makes equities less attractive\nMiller's maybe I can get a little higher yield bond so I'm going to get out of the equity game the fed keeps on raising rates are going to even though the ... you know so that kind of squashed a little bit of the economy or are they really going to continue to raise rates we don't know I we have a strong US dollar right now what does that mean what is a strong US dollar even mean that means\nThat we have a strong dollar meaning we can go purchase stuff from other countries right now okay we want to have a a a strong dollar naturally want a strong economy et cetera strong dollar but it's a catch twenty two because if your dollar becomes too strong\nNobody can afford your stuff in other words people in other countries will not by our stuff because our dollars too strong issue expensive and it was kind of like an exchange rate so see that way so in other words if if I Want to buy some stuff out of\nChina or anywhere okay and the U.S dollar is strong I can buy a lot of their stuff okay 'cause my my dollar stronger than your whatever your currency is okay so that's good because we can buy a bunch of their stuff but it's good for them because they get to sell a bunch of their stuff OK\nSo eventually the dollar can become strong enough\nThat it's kind of comes back to bite you you know because now you can't sell anything to foreign countries because you're stuffed too expensive\nAnd then that causes again an equalizing effect right\nSo all of that to say we don't know what the market is going to do you better do some math uh and determine how much you need to have on the short in and how much you need to have ... that you won't need to have for awhile by all means with your your brokerage accounts whether their IRAs or non Irish doesn't matter\nHave some form of monitoring device on that we use wealth guard on all of our managed accounts here\nWe're managing the money's actively and an underpinning that is a portfolio monitoring device Colwell guard it will signal to me if an account starts to go haywire on the advice to oh yeah we don't touch even faster oh yeah and then if it if it were to fall far enough\nIt would trigger a hedge and the account to where you sell off part of what has a has done poorly because at that point we don't know if it's going to continue to head south or if we're going to get a bounce back or you know or what it is\nSo you know these are some of the things you got to think of and and but you have to start with some basic math but for goodness sake you cannot continue to buy the idea of don't worry about it it'll come back I think as we are getting ready to close the show here a Christian let me say this\nIf you have not gone on line and just Google Ehsan ... five hundred you know as the five hundred and find a chart that goes all the way back to a Nineteen twenty nine I use one that is is interactive and you can move a little line around history gives you all that data is kinda cool [noise]\nBut what's interesting that people don't understand is that yeah you could say over the past forty years at the market as average seven percent okay but it's not a linear okay and if you're retiring at a peak\nYour retiring at a peak okay as opposed to atrocity retiring if people in the market is at its peak and you think you're wealthy okay and you are but then you see that drawdown\nYou retire okay\nThis is going to be a problem so if we're examining the health of our portfolio and whether or not we are going to make it let's not examine the statistical probability of success in any market was only look at the peaks\nLet's look at the probability of success in with my portfolio based on only times when the market was an all time high that's a much more relevant and today's market and economic environment that would be a much more relevant conversation I think but anyway maybe too much for radio but come on and we'll show you have little looks like\nThe whole point is we've had some volatility here recently you need to be prepared for the future it doesn't mean the end is necessarily near it just means that hey the market isn't always on top that's reality never is that way so what's your plan for when things change if you haven't visor that's just kind of one of those hang in there it will come back around guys\nThat's not OK when you're fifty five and older and if you live here in around Omaha the guy to go to if you're fifty five and over is Darryl Bryan and his team at the Bryant retirement strategies come in for a portfolio X ray they will do a complete second opinion of everything our risk or turn in the analysis of every single investment that you have\nA well looking inflation for the future find out if your portfolio is tax efficient now moving forward

imagine not um and\nI'm a when you look at it that when I drove by it and if Assad looks kind of nice but then you look back and you realize oh it looks like a metal building was really young when there's a reason it went up there in a parking\nYeah I think they I I I think they're pretty good on that um when I was looking at it it looked like there was some extra area in the back I don't know if that's different parcel of land or not but um I think they have a fair amount of parking although with the way people flock to casinos I'm I'm sure they may occasionally fill it all up\nTo face the great flood about a hundred and twenty five years ago mhm we have seen on the side of the river\nYes yes thanks to the flood I'm On the Army Corps of engineers repositioning the me under loop [laughter] I like that ... that's pretty good though the term from your college ... a geography elective absolutely um\nSo anyway so yeah we'll see how that goes and uh so for for gamblers there is no way fourth choice coming\nI'm next weekend for those you have a phobia of of being on the east side of the river you can gamble on the west side the river although you still are in um the state of Iowa and the county of pot of water me about your end Carter like\nInstead of Council Bluffs okay a shifting gears a little higher on the sophistication level architect magazine has chosen the Highlander building in North ... for the cover\nOf it's October edition Trenton wow yeah this is pretty cool um you know architect\n... magazine is a little bit of highbrow for some of the people that are in a monthly hanging around in the studio I ... you know I'm not a regular subscriber okay uh so I don't really know if it's a monthly quarterly annually a weekly daily I'm I'm not entirely sure\nAre sponsored by the Highlander um or spots we don't know that\nBut the Highlander um that says a twenty three acres of land in North Omaha a bill to Seventy five thousand square foot building on\nThere and this is part of that if you're not familiar with that we've talked about in the past episodes before though this is a really cool ambitious effort to as the developer says ... ... a part of the near north side that had been underwhelming or that area of land that's about all along the west side thirtieth street\nA little bit south of lake\nAnd um at one time it had been a public housing complex that had been demolished and the land for perhaps ten years if I'm thinking properly sat\nFallow yeah there was a good use for Penn so this is a good use but yeah kudos to um the developers of the highlights mellow and company yeah is that the what the Seventy\nFive north ... corporation a kudos to them for land to get on the cover of architect magazine pretty cool stuff\nUm and then um next up on the docket talk a little bit about a ah Bellevue and there was an interesting article in the Bellevue leader a newspaper about a housing boom that is occurring in the\nArea in and around Bellevue, Nebraska of course uh uh the oldest city in the state of Nebraska Bellevue\nAnd a eleven subdivisions are now underway and all of these subdivisions when a fully fleshed out\nA would add about six thousand five hundred people to the Bellevue population wow I'm now a presumably deserved sanitary improvement districts so that people initially wouldn't be part of the city of Bellevue until such time that Bellevue addicts as those people but\nBut Trenton I'll give you a little uh overview of this they're saying or in the article that you know this is kind of um a boom that they haven't seen in many many years in Bellevue and\nAnd um I'll just go through the Lebanon new subdivisions under development spring ridge twenty fifth and child's Ashford hollow north at forty second in a highway three Seventy liberty at forty eighth and highway three Seventy\nFalcon point forty eight in ... park road ... law go\nForty eighth and K part road lions gate at forty eight insured and wrote a sense a lot of forty eight cedar grove at forty eighth in Sheridan Road must be across the street from lions gate\nA cedar grove different cedar grove forty nights and Clearwater Dr\nFair view south of twenty fifth unfair view road fair view south to at twenty first in pilgrim drive and hide a hills at twenty us and ... view road\nSo that begs the question Joe six thousand sixty five hundred square sixty five hundred new bills will sites over the next few years\nThat's that's a lot for for no pun intended a lot for Bellevue and I wonder how much competition and whether it's healthy competition and what the build up kind of most of the article talk about where their sores extended or something to to allow this land because\nThere's a lot of places you know the the flight path for for profit\nMake someone that you know some of Bellevue unbelievable\n[noise] yeah well you know they've had a lot of ... a lot of areas that have been billed double for a while and I think well you know got an remember a couple of things at play er during and in the years following the great recession a single new single family neighborhood development in the metro area was\nAlmost nonexistent right and it's only been in the last few years a couple of years really in which it's popped and we've talked about that a few times on the show\nRecently but when we've talked about it we've only talked about a billion ... now and west northwest Omaha and those were the areas where it really seen it and we never mentioned to Bellevue and remember this but they also say going crazy now\nI I Want to say that that all of the metropolitan area and maybe I maybe I'm just talking about Douglas County but I think that that you know equilibrium has kind of about twenty five hundred to three thousand last year\nAnd maybe you have two or three times as a call at eight or nine thousand lot build them all lots available for inventory 'cause it takes a year to to develop a subdivision let's say\nAnd to have six sixty five hundred bills will lots or or lots coming on line\nThat that's a that's a lot of him into her Bellevue\nYeah yeah it really is now I who knows how long these neighborhoods will take to build out completely I'm sure it'll be years and years for some of them\nUm although some will go a little faster you tend to notice that in West Omaha but um you know the the the other big question if you talk about the total number of lots that our equilibrium as you say\nDid we fall behind a quite a bit in those years following the great recession I Know the coming end of the great recession if I remember correctly we had a hell of a glut of planted lots and and and started neighborhoods\nBut that probably was was was absorbed\nYeah and when it comes to the the the complimentary commercial I haven't heard of any really new\nMajor commercial developments in Bellevue you know most of the ... here in ... county is a little farther out west you know there's there's still a lot of land and developers hands and in between in la vista I'm Will Giles and and uh especially three Seventy\nWell perhaps that's because battalions had quite a head start I mean because the single family housing construction to propel you and has been really robust for a couple of years now\nAnd and as you always say Trenton the old real estate saw a retail follows rooftops if if we're just kind of in the very early phases rooftops follow churches rooftops other churches and churches follow farmland\nAnd convenience stores I'm ready to retail follows rooftops and and the sixty five houses in the Bellevue are are relatively early in the development process\nIt's probably yet to come and and the other thing is it seems to me that the retail development we do see\nIn Omaha these days tends to be pretty small scale like little neighborhood thing here yeah and they weren't anything there um you know the big box activity in our markets almost non existent these days\nOr an action nationwide nationwide as well yeah I've got a good point but it can be it's going to be fasting to see this because here here's the other thing that I find very interesting with all of this a residential development traditional single family development on the suburban fringes\nIn now Bellevue ... and ... and west northwest Omaha ah for the last\nTen years there's been a heavy heavy emphasis and a lot of success on urban infield development for residential and all the ... that shows no signs of going away and now you're seeing this other things so that'll be fun to see how it all plays out\nAbsolutely and here's a ... I'm from a quick development updating you probably hear her to hear first I was talking to the broker that represents a five below which is kind of a fun story that five dollars and less and everything from scientists link you used to\nCool floats and everything else is a big growing retailer um they've got about five locations throughout Omaha and I can tell you that it's going to a wolf creek which is like Fifteen than a with a corner Oscar\nYeah yeah and that was previously report in okay fine and then um I mean I don't want you to I Want to get I don't want to generalize give us credit shadow lake town center okay we're talking about how long are we did not a breaking news south street market place and I think that's breaking news\nUm where else disease or I'm sure they want to say probably can't think of\nWolf creek else St marketplace shadow lake town center\nAnd blank and blank yeah what are the blanks\nOr get the next Retton that's called show prep show her song ... lack of memory it is called event gone two weeks you've you've gotten rusty ... okay so there you have it there you have it five below going to wolf creek shadow towns that are not eight five hundred square feet so those ... those\nAnd we'll come back to grow Omaha there is only showed dedicated to the growth and development of your favorite city Jeff Beals along with\nTrenton magazine for many I

have a beautiful facility or work it's got a lot of collaborative work faces\nAnd that we think it's going to be state of the arc that kind of sort of our customers\nSo when you were looking at where to place this\nYou know Omaha obviously we we've been a big insurance market here for insurance companies in in um the regulations but also almost no one is like almost the birthplace of\nOf telemarketing and customer service support and I don't know but just aren't neutral accent or the phone lines because of the air force base in the union Pacific and everything else but um\nIs it easier to recruit people in them on now that that that are in bone about telemarketing is not as as big anymore\nWell I I'm fishing for Omaha was that a number of the reason that you mention it got very talent who are in the kinds of talents that we're looking for in contact center industry the insurance industry\nThe in the technical infrastructure in Omaha is is state in the yard and and so for us to be able to attract talent was was one of the biggest things that we were looking for on our list\nA we have been able to then very successful um in in recruiting talent there we were very
