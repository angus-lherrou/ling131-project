come up I Know you asked originally about attacks question but this is why you engage a professional who's in that business that might points something out that I'm never going to see\nI think it's a dialogue going for you and we certainly will and will talk about the changes in tax laws and so forth as we see them\nBut drilling down and put a tax plan together for you\nI'm no more going to do that Chris than than than the a CPA is going to put an income plan together for that or to attorney they're not going to do that they don't know how to do that by a that is because it's a different industry so we have to collaborate that's why we like these are we feel are pretty high end a very trustworthy and a noteworthy firms are right here in town\nAnd there is a first step you can take if you don't know if you need a CPA you can come in and and sit down with her on the team and you know they have that tax mapping software they have that retirement benefit guide\nSome resources available to you if you'd like those four zero to nine three two two one for one to just get a grasp on where you may stand moving forward\nBut the best and I said it's not trying to be Jack of all trades master of none\nFocused on the investing part so he is often going to refer you to a CPA if that is necessary when it comes to your retirement because those tax mistakes or mistakes we can't afford to have as baby boomers moving into retirement\nSo if you'd like assistance with that that tax guide or maybe just a more information for zero to nine three two two one for one and all that

segment and I think is worse recovering are recovering again in this for segment here Christian is the fact is many many well known a think tank folk meaning economists\nAnd people who do a lot of forecasting are projecting a steep decline in the market a strong possibility of recessionary kind of like Great Depression stuff is even with us you know it but\nI Will say about all that stuff everybody has you know ... he's got an opinion but the point of the matter is there's a lot of people that are playing that address and we indeed we do know the GDP is cooling we do know that as I Know first hand\nFrom a climate was just in this week that ah architects are ... are now out looking for work people will not bringing them projects that are looking for something to do\nThat that's a sign of things not growing\nIndia's a sign of slowing and so these are a indicators and so what does a person do in this situation you should be prepared before it ever happens the last thing we want to do\nIs er just see Christian in my little corner of the world is to have somebody come in to see us in for example two thousand nine after the fact they were with another firm\nAnd whomever the it was that they were working with was not paying attention was not thinking about the retiree it was not thinking that this person cannot handle a significant downturn even though all the headlines just like today\nEven though all the headlines time magazine et cetera back then front cover is going to be recession or depression how bad is this thing going to get\nThose are very concerning uh headlines aren't they well we're seeing that type of dialogue already well what happened back in two thousand and eight nine is we had people come in two thousand attempts people come into my office with her hat in their hand saying I don't know what Mike I was thinking\nBut you're supposed to be the retirement guy fix it well I'm not a magician you know I I can do with what you used to have or would you have now but we could have done with what you used to have we should have thought of this\nBefore you buried your head in the sand and just stayed fully at risk and you never identified the dollars that you need to on the short term you never remove them from harm's way this is something that you're advisor should've suggests that you do\nAnd identify the dollars a unit on the short term mid term long term and then invest those appropriately and so do it now do it now do it now you got the dollars I mean when did know a bill the art\nYou know before it was necessary before you actually did it ... you know came down this is ... you think you got it\nMade now set it up I mean for God's sakes set it up I mean this is when you got the bucks to not try to make moves after it's

F. it'd be new center I'm Tom Stanton\n[noise]\nWell people are like ... that's the old Kmart in Stony Brook on a hundred and forty four straight OK so not not a very exciting retail least shop at you ...\nI guess maybe if you need some bubble wrap to that bubble wrap we've got some ropes and ... yeah do they have zip ties they do have ... so that's a whole another story and how these days you know we we better not go down as it's not a lot of people look at it from themselves and restaurant depot\nWhich is a very cool place this is that sixty nine twenty south a hundred and Eighteen\nSo really close to a kind of that Harrison I eighty area\nThere and this is a the Costco of restaurants so so if you want to if you own a restaurant you manage restaurant and you want to get all sorts of crazy materials or you can buy a membership to restaurant depot kind of the way you and I would buy arrest a membership to Costco and Sam's Club or something like that\nAnd you can go there and get everything you need for restaurant whether it's a slice or or a dice or or fresh food\nNow do they also re purpose used equipment as well I don't know ...\nMy ... I Do not know the answer if I had to guess I Would guess brand new because it's a retail outlet I thought you were to say do they re purpose food or something I doubt that part but\nMay not equipment well I'm just thinking you know all these restaurants are opening up and everything sometimes they close and I just feel like that exchange of used equipment is it's pretty valuable thing cause these things are expensive\nNo yeah that's a really good point um you know and and in our world in commercial real estate a lot of times we'll have\nA new restaurant that's going to be started and the owner will say to the any I in the dodge agent who's representing him or her can you find me an empty restaurant space it still has all the equipment I'll just move in and use that and when it when that happens that's always a nice bonus for a for a start up restaurant that happens a lot yeah it does\nAll right let's look at a couple of other things here on this report I'm flipping through flipping through looking for what I Want to tell you we need radio time killer right now I'm okay I ... the largest leases I think we wanted to talk about or the largest movements or something\nAnd I I mean can you remember what about shadow lake\nOkay so did it so\nYeah they sold it already and I think it's kind of interesting I think it's sold for how much do you remember\nUm I don't like it was like a\nForty nine or fifty nine million I mean that's a huge property I just thought that was kinda fun number to think of all we talked about it a little bit during the coasts are meeting in a kind of missing from the data but ah yeah big big big number\nWell and when it comes to shadow lake I mean how long before um that play starts to get another wave for another shot in the arm because it's had some vacancy issues here and there are lately and yet when you look at single family housing construction in the metro area\nOr the ... area along with northwest Omaha far northwest on all those are the two spots where\nIt's really happening or maybe also right now yeah but but it only makes sense that eventually you're going to see more activity a channel because we're just so many people going into that area in the meantime it's just a Halloween store and then it's\nA very nice one um and so it looks like some top retail leases ah see some of the biggest ones ah we already mentioned you haul restaurant depot gored men's\nIs returning to uh uh Omaha fifty thousand square feet going into space that used to be ... right and then Sorenson park plaza this was an nor Seventy second street I'm a big lots is going into their\nAnd another one of the biggest leases a signed retail leases it's only twenty four thousand feet but it's pretty significant the seventh biggest retail lease signed\nIs a Bentley dealership oh yeah yeah and going into the old brick space at a village point well let's turn our sights to the office market and a office vacancy now according to co stars only six point four percent also seems kind of low to me\nYeah especially with all the conversations we're having downtown about office space\nYeah I I was surprised to see that so it it may be off a little bit but if it is it is accurate that is an extraordinarily good sign\nAnd then ah ah let's see if ah we're talking about new buildings that were two new office buildings delivered to the market I eat completed construction in the third quarter totally in a hundred and twenty five thousand square feet will get into the specifics of those in a minute and a three quarters of ...\nMillion square feet of office space is currently under construction in Omaha right now and that one I kinda thought might have been a little bit higher a but it just depends on I guess what you're how you are defined it I suppose [noise]\nOkay attendance moving out of large blocks of space and twenty Eighteen include first national tech solutions leaving a hundred and fourteen thousand square feet at two o one north sixteenth street\nUm that's downtown Timberline total solutions moving out of thirty seven thousand square feet at eighty fourth and blonde do and the brass Korea will be moving out of twenty eight thousand square feet at a hundred and Seventy first and Bert that's a very nice building that has their sign on the outside of it [noise]\nUm and then ten it's moving into large blocks of space so foreign twenty Eighteen including ... life\nWhich is a moved into forty thousand square feet of never occupied space in the capital on headquarters downtown\nAnd so during which we've talked about moving into thirty eight thousand square feet at a hundred and eighty first in Burke and a brand new building\nThat building will also eventually be home to Lindsey court yeah they're moving their headquarters there yep and they'll say got finished here shortly after okay and they'll take up even more space than um than a Sojourners yeah so that building will be pretty much full I'd imagine\nAnd I'm a securities America has moved into twenty nine thousand square feet at ... valley tech center\nAnd then um you know and so we talked about that building where so journey and Lindsey uh have moved and are moving into um West Village point there's going to be another building\nOr even a story tall or that they've just started construction on directly to the north of that building and it's going to be retail there too right oh I didn't know that but that's really cool yeah you know there'll be\n... well ... there's a big plan right there yes as you know that entire town sort of chunky\nI Know what you're talking about yes and uh yeah that's about it but you know I think one of the one of the coolest office development things we've seen in years in Omaha has just been that whole area West Village point\nI mean you had core bank going in there you know my daughter was completed ... a year ago maybe\nI'm maybe more I don't I Can't quite remember just a lot office in that or it came up quick to I mean it's really it's impressive and then the ... group headquarters will be on the north side of dodge directly north of village point that's supposed to start construction really really soon\nYeah they've got some cool buildings up the Audi building looks really nice yeah one of those things it's fun to drive through\nBut this headquarters will be about four stories okay then that's finally look at the industrial market and uh now this does not surprise me industrial vacancies so this is warehouse and manufacturing buildings\nThree percent is all so Ninety seven percent additional space is occupied in this does not surprise me because our our agents it in the eye and the Dodgers have been a lamenting the lack of industrial space for a while\nYeah and I think a lot of our industrial experts are saying that that's even high probably yeah really yeah they're thinking actually lower six yeah\nI'm okay and then a total of ten\nIndustrial buildings were delivered to the market and the third quarter of twenty Eighteen\nThey total nearly a half a million square feet but this is the part that might shock you if you're a real estate a nerd like well I can I call you a real estate in her yeah you can learn a saw my were real estate nurse so were shocked by December square feet of ... industrial construction\nOr or rather I should say square feet of industrial space that's currently under construction as of this time are you ready for this three point seven five\nMillion square feet and ... million sort of ...\nWell we were sort of um [noise] I caught seizing the office that Facebook is the large majority of that number\nThey have to be counted Facebook in that yeah yeah yeah because Facebook is what a couple of million square feet unto itself ... maybe more\nSo what we're saying is keep building where ... don't be don't see that number and be dissuaded by a to build yeah keep building out there\nI'm Glad you mentioned that because if you are an industrial developer\nUm we need you right now we need you to build build build because we just don't have enough space right now we we are aware of tenants that want to be an overhaul and we're not getting them because there's nowhere for them to locate in fact I'm a company out of Iowa known as our in our real T.\nJust this last week had a ribbon cutting for a new quarter million square feet beautiful warehouse if if we're houses can be beautiful which to real estate nerves that can be this is a beautiful warehouse\nI'm just south west of a hundred and forty fourth and highway three Seventy and the billionaire\nGreat high ceiling docks looked really nice\nThey've started work on a second one that will be a twin and then they're going to do two more after that so there'll be a million square feet right there that'll be a nice nice addition to the market\nOkay so ah that's you're a retail office and industrial real estate report for the third\nQuarter of two thousand Eighteen and that is your economic development news of the week which is brought to you by eagle mortgage eagle mortgage company dot com later in the show we're going to be talking with a couple
