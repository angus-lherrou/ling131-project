kind of interesting what's the weather forty the overnight low tomorrow sixty nine currently forty seven an overhaul council blessed and Lincoln news radio eleven ten K. F. A. B.\nBrothers that attempted mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that are as Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy or NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nVery sad woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that the same Thomas raskin former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again to the bill Cunningham shown Thomas or you\nCould eat very tough situation awful um well when I watch some of the morning\nAnd afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all and I hit menial jobs there was a truck driver did various other little things\nDoor neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nAnd you had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was to uh tonight zone Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren Jewish\nAnd ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless uh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting\nSaying that uh that are in fact uh\nOr Sanders put out something a few hours ago that said is there any tragedy in the Washington Post were not exploit to attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some have said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should have known how many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic\nI anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like every day who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI not as of yet I've seen\nIs you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the long horsemen or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was monitoring his tweets his social media is other things he was posting couldn't have alerted only\nWhat the what we know when you say is a few things say something\n[laughter] this case\nYou know someone had this scene right and could've alerted the police on the police when you find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or didn't look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him\nAnd we can criticize the police but until that time police and law enforcement agencies intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting and Broward County there was one in a recall FBI numerous people had caught about an Eighteen year old up punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people called in and it wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfect center in law enforcement correct\nNo production on horse you're only as good as she is today and wish I could go on for shipping is very easy to do after seeing a law enforcement is tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD we always look back we always\nDid a review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case in the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers had posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics ongoing in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media\nSomebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating and and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individual sadly in the country like ours wedding for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOf like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against ah against Jews\nAnd against African Americans there were several hundred did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\nBut the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you went and then why do you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media accounts three fifty seven magnificent some blocks that were legally purchased than they are Fifteen they're still tracking that thing down and see what it is\nA him someone is posing anti Semitic slurs and saying I'm going in and they have guns that isn't that another tempted something's about to happen\nThat's what you would hope you would hope and from the polls Pittsburgh Police departments standpoint you would have gotten that call or the FBI would have gotten a call and then if you dropped the ball is a law enforcement agency [laughter] and it's on you\nBut in this case nothing I have seen about ... hours showed any thing\nTo indicate that he was becoming radicalized and he was becoming what we call lone wolf\nAnd they was going to do something other than his ramps still right before you went in yesterday when he said I'm going in and if police knew about it and that will come to light if they didn't then why didn't someone else who saw this alert police\nThomas rescue and you have some doubt how many other Robert Bowers are running around this country and I would assume there are several thousand just like him in a nation that three hundred and forty million people\nAnd let's face in America is the most pro Jewish pro Israel Israel especially with with Trump in the White House nation on the face of the earth\nAnd this is the place or were were were were Jews do well and there's about three million or so three and a half million Jews in America disproportionately successful because of faith and family because of connections because of hard work because of academics disproportionate success\nAnd so those who are jealous or whatever they got to have a scapegoat for the failures in their life and they look at someone successful so many Jews disproportionately succeed in business and entertainment and finance and the law in Madison and I found it so electorate said that this afternoon\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors

reasonable borders and David Wray will once again welcome to the bill Cunningham show and David how you doing\nDoing great my friend about you\nGo let me share with the American people something you've uh put forth in one of your ...\nAnd that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing in the bombs and all that stuff going on in the victims and and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media do attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some sense closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organize stunned by political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place\nAnd said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened\nWith the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media will deal with\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of a you know weaponized migration\nIf you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand disenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt\nA you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work but others are MS Thirteen a\nGang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a\nEast Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to stay out of this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their own meals are suddenly appearing tents are suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nFree hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explain why now here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on its belly along with water intensive medical care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will uncover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh caravans\nThat are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that has an even left yet but I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies and so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nAnd not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably to Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent of the so called a migrant\nOur young males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty it's impressive offer a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough jungles in the heat and sand and deserts that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are left as politicians who hate Trump and want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there is Fifteen and twenty thousand one hundred Fifteen to twenty million\nWell you know there are forty one million people in Central American I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this caravan no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I wanted a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum and they are in like Flynn\nThey are here they're going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years never showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks who exploited the asylum loopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states this is a gimmick\nThey're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes and they have not had a single democratic vote\nTo uh to do so and you asked to ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run for mass illegal immigration\nWhen you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them end up registering his Democratic\nColleagues I forgot to government assistance but\nYeah I mean you're barely making it you're going to vote for the party that hand you the most goodies and uh you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens is sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat\nThat would that would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats in the last Twenty years and every one for probably the next forty", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city":
