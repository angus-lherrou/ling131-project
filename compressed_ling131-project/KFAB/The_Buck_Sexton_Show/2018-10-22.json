how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know give the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump but now President Trump he truly cares about other people he's extremely\nMagnanimous and private he is funny gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to me that you actually is and if you listen to the media is the worst human being on the planet hell but the truth is\nExceptionally gracious I've seen so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media worst Research Center bows out well Brent boroughs out one of my buddies\n... every few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only\nIt was in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad why does the media only report the bad enough to good\nThey only report the bad in this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy was growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time in our nation's history they'd conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump did an interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview had to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him\nFour times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad not to give him the credit that he deserves for the successes that he's had because they're no longer in the business of reporting the news and they're now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana friend in his mob\nVersus jobs the only difference is the immune to Jay and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh along about trucks that have a Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at a Republican congressman\nRepublican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with and\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because look the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we found was secretary Nielsen of da ...\nWe've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence say antifa is so out of control their goal on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created\nI think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper then I Will watch nonetheless I saw it on TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office in performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news\nFor a week on and that wrap that the the country artist would\nHave had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her new using that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult\nHe was the president of the United states the leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with their children in the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse drawn away and I'm sure the media would say well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nIt has always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett bows out Ninety two percent of the media coverage of this president\nIs negative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty five percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent I Would expect that but we're not we are we are now back up on top where the most competitive country in the world again\nFor the first time in ten years and there is no credit for what this press has done let alone but twenty Americans who've been

come back just a week or so ago and that was a it was a blip on the radar screen the president's getting twenty Americans\nEither and North Korea and Egypt or wherever they have been home that's part of his job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media Brock Obama would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening on doors in Guatemala there's at least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico\nAnd the mainstream media hate\nThis kind of an issue percolating a little over

Brett Kavanaugh having been confirmed to the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the fifth vote\nOf the five of the five member majority who would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nAnd he gave me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think the FCC I think the IRS but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day made an office is mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them rulemaking powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of harm in the sense of\nFor businesses of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with compliance activities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each year it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nDo that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually ... ah either from businesses or from individuals each year\nThey very significant thing but it can be turned back towel and be reduced give me hold on\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the courts can step in\nAnd began to review carefully the legislation\nUnder which all of these rules are made and very frequently um the rules are based on laws that were passed years ago or ... generations ago and they are perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called judicial court it do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency then we can actually beginning to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nWallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen eighty seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talents of government\nIs it best reflects the will of the people in reality at least for the past fifty years and it was perceived Congress is number one it was received the presidents number two and they ... and the court system is number three\nIn reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the presidency is the most powerful number two is the current number three is the Congress the Congress\nIs feckless foolish any relevant and and so what would the founding fathers day if they were transported from Seventeen Ninety seven to twenty Eighteen and October twenty Eighteen and they looked at the situation today what when that Congress is foolish and feckless\n[laughter] I think it would be amazed amazed but when they studied it for a while I think they would understand why this happened and I think the reason is that the courts have given administrative agencies not to present it actually it's administered of age and downs with even the president doesn't control [noise] they've given administrative agencies\nSo much authority by passing laws that are very very general that are sort of goals oriented laws and that gives the agency's\nTremendous authority to make the major decisions that they should not be making Congress should make the major decisions the agencies should only be filling in the details and owned unfortunately overtime because Congress has because the courts have not stepped in to stop this\nCongress has been encouraged to pass these very general laws then they go home to their constituents and they say you see I\nSolve this problem for you and when the constituent complains about some new regulation that's come out the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that that's the administrative agency\nAnd what the what the constituent unfortunately doesn't recognize is that the congressman has to take responsibility has to be accountable for that because the congressman did not vote for legislation that restricted", "year": "2018",
