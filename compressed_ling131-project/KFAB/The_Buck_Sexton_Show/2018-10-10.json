less than two hundred grand\nSomething like that which you could say well bug you still makes a good living yeah I get it but you know he could be making millions but he didn't do that he's gone into the judiciary and understands it that's a very important role in very important service and\nThey don't want to look at his record though as a judge where he was ... really universally praising understood to be top of his field\nThat's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions within the right\nKavanaugh was from the ... gold standard choice he wasn't the go all in and try and own the lips choice at the Supreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick\nKevin ... was the guy who was doing what he could in order\nTo at least be impartial as a judge should me whenever he hears cases and they try to ruin him they tried to destroy his life destroys family destroys reputation\nThat there is no more room\nFor anyone who calls himself a conservative sit around and say yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this\nBe nicer to the lives take their arguments more seriously play more fair with them feel a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore it's not a serious argument in ... finally recognize that\nWhat they have been doing is no longer the way business will be done that they can no longer shame and destroy with impunity we must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we know to be good and right for the country no matter\nHow much they scream no matter how much they banged on the doors that Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act like a bunch of Savage is we have to push forward\nAnd we have to stay United and we have to win Trump understands that that said Kavanaugh's like well I'm I'm Still going to be nonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing to try and heal the country and so then so much as possible forums liquid to\nArticle three of the constitution provides that the judicial power Shelby vested in one Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court as an institution of law it is not a partisan or political institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an idle\nWe do not caucus in separate rooms for Supreme Court as a team of nine\nAnd I will always be a team player on the team of non [noise] I was not appointed to serve one party or one interests but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he does that is what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court\nHe was with the majority opinion or almost all the time other judge is looking at the law agree with Kevin all almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interpret the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much\nBut there is an underlying truth here and that is that the country is a better place with more respect for the rules were there will be more respect for the rule of law where every American will have his rights more respected\nUnder the constitution because ... Rao judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because he's justice capital\nLiberals will in fact benefit from Kavanaugh's presence on the Supreme Court they just don't realize it\nBecause they don't really want somebody calling balls and strikes when it comes to the constitution they want to ring or they want somebody who will tell them yes the constitution says that thing you wanted to say even though it doesn't at least Kevin all will say\nI may not like this policy I may think this leads to bad outcomes\nIn public life for a whole bunch of reasons but this is what the constitution says this is what the case law tells us\nAnd with respect to precedent and all the other\nInterpretation issues that come to mind ... I'm not going to give you the decision that I think I should based upon what I Want to\nGive you a decision based on what is the law vicious where liberal separate from conservatives this is how we differ on the Supreme Court on the constitution\nAnd what all this means Scalia\nSchool is a perfect example he he would say look I I don't I don't agree with flag burning you know but that doesn't mean that I think that there shouldn't be flag burning under the law was like I don't I don't like flag burning\nBut you you should not be made illegal you know what I mean you look at some of\nThese decisions from very concerned conservatives will protect the rights of liberals even on issues that they feel very passionately\nAbout and that they do not because it's about principle right they they do not agree with\nThe end policy for progressive is all about the final outcome it's all about you know did Ruth Bader Ginsburg and ... and it said or did you did they\nGive us the semi divine rich from these judges over the Supreme Court these unelected super legislators did they give us what we want\nAnd that's how they judge Supreme Court which is why they have such a problem\nWith Kavanaugh um but we have entered a a very interesting period right now\nPost Kavanaugh getting through heading into the midterms\nI don't know if the Democrat psyche\nCan really handle that the collective psyche of the ... the Democrat Party can really handle what it means if they don't gain the Senate which I don't think they will a pretty darn very confident they well it's a Republican to maintain the Senate majority\nWhat if they don't take a house majority after two years of Trump\nAt what point do they feel some of their beliefs must be moderated what does it take to repudiate progressive ism today I don't have an answer for you\nBut I Do know that we should start to consider the tears the possibility\nThat nothing in their minds can reputed that that know outcome no reality no truth can undermine their beliefs because this isn't about policy differences for the left this is about fundamental belief their zealots and they have internalized\nThis system of political belief in such a way that it is now existential to their sense of identity\nLeftist think that their politics defines who they are as human beings how do we begin to strip that away how do we begin to pull that apart so that we can see each other now as we would like it to be which is people that have different ideas on how the country should be run\nWill get it as more of a say much more stay with the

went\nI took a wax class that was interesting uh it was actually Islamic constructions of gender so I took a class on a women's engender studies class on Islam who wants to get how critical uh of\nOf the Islamic faith the women's in gender studies professors willing to be the answer is not really at all\nSummer how\nWomen are treated better according to the class in Pakistan and they are in America I don't know how we got there but that's that's how that's how they thought\nYou know the burqa freeze women they would say I know this is the stuff that I was subjected to college radicalized me as a conservative in a sense of being a radical conservative just means that you know you like celebrating the fourth of July and I've read the constitution at at at at ... editor matters to you\nI'm that's being a radical can surf or somebody who believes the constitution says what it says and that we all have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and\nThat makes you in today's day and age that makes you a radical conservatives according to the left but college was\nCertainly a process radicalization for me and that way but the grieving studies departments\nAre churning out millions of young people who really think that they have something\nWhere someone to blame for all of their frustrations that shortcomings in life that there's there's some reason\nSome reason that is not of their own making up their own doing that their life is disappointing that they're not as successful\nWe're not as respected or not is loved or whatever the problem may be and it has nothing to do with either one part of growing up I found very important one part of the wisdom of age is just understanding that you know it's it's hard that everybody is carrying a heavy load that everybody is waging their own\nBattle that is typical for them and it's not supposed to be easy I mean I I've as it was somebody said to me once or a\nOr a writer colleague of mine writer friends said you know whoever told the your your job you're I think he was quoting someone I don't know who but whoever told told you that your goal is\nTo be happy life [laughter] and it's an interesting way of like the difference in being virtuous and being good and being happy happy is conditional right happy can come and\nGo virtue goodness decency honor those constants those are all in your control\nAnd to change our perception of happy to such that it's not everything's going great I'm comfortable I'm respected I Love dime revered I Am\nYou know all those things and have it more focused around who am I what do I do every day joy make other people's lives easier and better do I make a positive addition to whatever situation I'm In whether it's in the home or outside the home am I being positive my being additive\nAh they don't but they won't cheat started school instead what they want to teach you on college campuses and what the media reinforces now when we're adults\nIs that there are extra colonel reasons for your frustrations as an American\nAnd those external region reasons now invariably\nHave to do with white males somewhat some out white males around the ultimate ... we we are\nPublic enemy number one in America and there's a lot of us so obviously a lot of enemies we are the bad guys based on this underlying media narrative and once you start to put it in those terms once you were willing to speak about it in an open way you're not saying oh gosh that can't really know that is true\nThen much of what we've seen here with the whole Kavanaugh debacle and I say that about the process it's as any of you listening to show knows I was as fired up about Kavanaugh's I've been about any anything\nUm in defense of Kavanaugh and then in absolute opposition to this obvious smear effort by the left I did everything I could I mean I was reaching out it wasn't just normal\nDay of the office for the buck man with Kavanaugh I was reaching out to colleagues across media how do we get the word out we need to make this we need to make this point we need to refute this nonsense and you know we we were doing everything they were all bunch of us doing everything we could to\nTry to break this propaganda offensive which is what it was on the left against Kavanaugh\nBut I have been troubled to see how many women who are liberal leftist feminist types have a real problem gauging what reality is uh and and\nReally do believe that they are oppressed in America in twenty Eighteen\nIn a way that does not reflect a reasoned understanding of what's really going all around us they they have conjured up this America in their mind where women are in the ... instead of thinking of\nWomen as revered as you know moms and sisters and wives and friends and colleagues\nAnd and the the fact that women are more women are graduating from college as a percentage than men women are doing better in college than men are more women than ever before in the workforce more room than ever before getting advanced degrees\nI mean this is ... and they're getting more and they're getting where a college degree than men so it is you start to why they have to say well\nWhat does a ... a press that seems like that seemed like a bit of a stretch but how else can you explain their response to Trump's Trump's point about how it can be a scary time to be a man right now\nAre and what he really meant it as a scary time to be a a man who gets on the wrong side of the liberal left because they will not just go after you\nAnd exaggerate things to go after you they will make things up they will just they will do a hit on you\nKnow which is what we've seen which is what the whole country has been subjected you in the last couple of weeks member described Trump said uh we have is going to be said as scary as a scary time ferment play that\nWell I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you get the ah guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very\nDifficult time [noise] what's happening here has much for what you do that even the appointment of it's a free or just [noise] it really does [noise] you could be somebody that was her figures higher life as somebody accused you of something that\nAnd in response a singer songwriter named Lindsey lab Stewart out of Texas wrote a parody song of that statement I suppose we could say it's a scary time for women according to a her assessment but ah here's look she's got she's she's talented here's out some of it goes play it\nMade a name in Nineteen Ninety nine can live and\nI Can't use them and then they might in Ninety and Anthony Mann again\nAnd again and again you\nKnow you're not gaining\n[noise] okay now\nAs I said they're nice voice obviously has some talent political analysis has a few things you said\nAbout any people say oh buckets art and she was running okay but she's this was a parody song she's making a political point so I'm dealing with it as a function of politics and she's responding to what the president said about how it's a scary time to be a man\nShe says things like it is or rather ... you can't have the windows open when you're a woman home alone no if you live in an unsafe\nNeighborhood I maybe maybe you feel that way but that seems a bit extreme\nConsidering also that America is at the\nNow the bottom end of a fifty year decline in violent crime I I think that that's a little that's a a little bit extreme but and then just say that you can't go to the bar without a chaperone\nWell I Know a lot of women and having a lot of women in my day and\nLet them go to the bar without a chaperone\nAnd I know plenty of women who wear miniskirts all the time and or would feel free to where many sure whenever they chose to and not feel weird about it and plenty of women who if somebody slid into a GM is when someone DM somebody else on Twitter or you know writes them on Facebook or who would say whatever they felt like saying\nSo why are we being told that these are all things that women can't do why make these claims that are ridiculous Clinton's now that's not to say that bad things don't happen\nTo women everyday across the country and there aren't bad men out there who perpetrate horrible crimes with someone of of course we all know that that we're we're having we're trying to have an adult conversation here we're not having a conversation about oh you're saying that there is no this is what the left those were you saying that sexual assault is it a problem of course of\n... it's a it's a heinous crime a felony for which people are severely punished as they should be\nBut there is a hysteria and this is what I'm really\nTrying to get out with the lyrics in this song and the way that the media talks about this there's this hysteria among leftist feminists\nRape culture on campus rape culture as there is still recall shrunk campus rape is a is a horrible crime it's illegal in all fifty states and is prosecuted vigorously\nAh so what where is this coming from\nAnd I mean the truth is that the same identity politics to be very divisive view of day to day life the Democrat Party takes about all groups of different ethnic groups and religious groups also applies to the sexes\nA it also applies to the way that the left used the role of women or the ... the ... if you will to the position of women in American\nSociety and it's just not in keeping with reality and that is very troubling because once again we have this problem of\nHow do you engage with the other side when you can't agree on the underlying foundation of what is real and what is not how old are you in gauge the other side on issues like women walk around dressing whoa I mean I'm here in DC I live in New York when this is this is not the Taliban\nVersion of American women walk around dressing however the water as they will should and women are\nVery safe in this country by the numbers compared to what what would be the case in a ... a lot of other places all over the world and and there's something inherently that feels a little\nUh on just about\nClaiming publicly it this way\nAnd it's not just the singers are this is this is common among the ... that that that men especially men who will say things like well rape cultures admit that we don't care about these issues that as a slur that as a slender\nJust not true why did they go there\nUm because quite honestly they've been fed lives and they believe these lies they really do think that one in five women sexually assaulted or because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted looks as sexual assault which is what was included in some of those surveys [noise]\nUh so the facts don't line up with this but facts in this and with many other things\nMake liberals uncomfortable and so they prefer to exist it as much as possible and emotion first

F. it'd be on Tom's dancing as you've been hearing a jam packed mid America\nCenter in Council Bluffs was the stage for President Trump's more than our long rally tonight\nThe cameras to just take us with this\nLatest rally to boost a GOP candidates ahead of next month's midterm elections in as expected Trump announced gasoline was Fifteen Percent ethanol would be sold year round\nI don't think pump pale would have been secretary of state and another minister ration but he's a former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I didn't compares great but you know he's somewhat of an established needs a Tea Party congressman I Know but still uh\nBut I don't think ... this matters all that much people find it interesting because the dynamics between Trump and and and Haley and the others in his cabinet who were thought of as being very Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump ... is increasingly\nI've always thought it's a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor effect right it's it's a title that guys being trumpeted that means is kicking button taking names so whilst they focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh ... because there's thought\nIn the GOP that Nikki Haley is is the most likely\nPost Trump GOP nominee\nNow let's just pull that down to earth for a moment here uh does anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like in six years never mind in in you know in in ... Oregon and in two years never my six\nAnswers now they got no idea I Am I absolutely certain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman certainly fits into what all these political journalists like to do just come up with a narrative that will interest people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different\nTwenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation spilling filled the airwaves with speculation and\nYou know you'll you'll ah never have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty of speculation is easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this but those are all I think so and so it was going to run on things don't look at part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun and it can be interesting and it's just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run\nOn the honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that she is necessarily\nI'm quite as a compelling a Kennedy because here's here's what the what did you always gotta remember in these situations are side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling\nOur side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish in a minority you know in fact what is said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side\nWho achieve high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders trader to their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be\nA lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh\nThat she was a a a gender traitor which I suppose is is now he's saying [noise]\nUm but I think that uh you know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day answer everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations is speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into political twelfth\nComing into the airline is that we make sure that everything is in good faith effort here to command and Danny and I'm proud and part of the team now I don't have anything that\nAround and go I think that um the main thing when we got our first dictionaries and we don't want to hurricane down here ... sitting for hitting of them I think how many\nYears have had an ironic ... it's been eight years and then ... ... I think you have to be an option now when you\nFound in someone else to do the task [laughter] [noise]\nYeah there you go pardon on good terms reputation intact didn't have some big or injure personal blow up with the administration that's why she's leaving folks I I Wish I could tell you there was some crazy\nYour story than that and if there is also that you know but for now it is what it is Nikki Haley is heading out doesn't really matter who cares [laughter] that's\nMy analysis of it I Know all book no what are you doing uh but I I Do want to spend a little time with you on the\nMidterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America\nThe concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good right now kind of me so strong we are fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing and\nCreating permits ability and then I Would that that's not now I Know we're still in Afghanistan but we're not losing people every day we we don't have a hundred hundred and fifty thousand troops\nServing in these countries are serving in in a war zone and overall things are really good right now\nOr the media the mainstream in his in his backyard but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset that is a concern for me I wanted to address that and also just the overall narrative from the less going into these midterms that's going to come up and just a moment\nRadio or [noise]\n\nHow does one never miss a customer again when customers called check your email expressed to me automatically engages them

stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the Senate that went civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican members led by\nThe president [noise] really demeaned the confirmation process\nCivility folks Hillary Clinton's in one of the leaders of the lives is out there telling people\nThat for civility to Richard in our politics\nFor that to happen Democrats have to win\nThis is the problem we have right now with the political exchange between the two sides\nThey are delusional\nThis reminds me of an of an editorial that I had been meaning to bring up to you or earlier in the week I was so excited to talk to you on Monday could have been a few days that I skipped right past us but the editor in chief of Politico\nWho I don't I'm not even really familiar with I Know with political is which is a political side for left wing people or it doesn't bill itself as that but that is in fact what it is a but he wrote a piece about how maybe\nMore or less it's time to to take the gloves off\nA about how ... maybe now is the time for Democrats to stop playing nice stop playing nice they were accusing cabinet on being a gang rape is during Senate hearings these people are completely insane they're completely nuts\nHow do you even look I got asked this question recently by a college kid at a at a conference where I gave a speech what do you do when people call you a Nazi\nBecause you're pro Second Amendment I said there's nothing you can do don't engage 'cause you're talking you might as well be talking to the person who's pushing around a shopping cart with you know John three sixteen written on a piece of cardboard hanging out of it I mean that's that's what we're up against now\nAnd this is unfortunately the end result of a massive media echo chamber that has given this kind of thinking some form of of intellectual cover for a very long time that's what's really going on here\nPeople think that this is a normal way to approach their problems they think this is a normal way to deal with the other side should just go completely scorched earth insane\nAnd then they to borrow from the left the Democrats have normal lives they're crazy and is there are crazy tactics and so what is crazy to a normal person is no longer crazy to Democrats\nI you know I\nI'm not I'm not even going to get to the the the clip I think today but somebody that I'm friends with over at a a nother\nNetwork or somebody in front of the other network you were saying today that what happens when people are being chased out of restaurants that's not a mom I\nI'm Sorry that's them up if we can't agree and this was at\nCNN and I'm not we're not going to play that clip today I'm going to let a just a cause cause I I like the I like the person\nOn a on a person to person level who who said this stuff but she's been subjected obviously to this kind of thinking too much and\nHas unfortunately bought into it at some level if we can't agree\nThat the people that are chasing Ted Cruz at a restaurant or the people that are public officials who are laughing about Rand Paul almost being beaten to death on his front lawn because someone didn't like what Rand Paul stood for\nA ... if if they're going to laugh about that if they're going to go on TV is senator Hirono did and said well you know this is just what happens\nSent meaning that people should yell at others and get up in their faces everything else if they're going to say that that's OK and that's normal we have no choice\nBut to own the lips are only choice becomes victory the only response we can have two this insanity\nIs to defeat them and do it and I don't know how else to say to enforce our political will through the system legally and legitimately upon them that's it\nThat is the ... that is the only option there's no other option\nYou know people who think that a gathering of angry loud ... it gathering of angry loud activists in a restaurant yelling at somebody and you know in front of his or you know his wife or her husband or whatever is not a mob if we don't use the term up for that we have no basis for discussion\nAnd this is where the left has really had it right now\nThat's why Hillary Clinton I Would notice is giving voices she's given covered this she's a disgrace we all know Hillary will say anything how much what I asked anything she will say anything that benefits are in the moment\nBut the media that pretense to care about civility they don't call Democrats out on this\nAnd they are living in a fantasy land when it comes to what's really going on in political discourse right now and and this notion that there's blame on both sides know that is false there is not blame on both sides here\nThere are outliers among Republicans and conservatives when it comes to\nOn civil behavior in public toward people politically but I'm not saying it never happens but it is an outlier\nIt is now standard operating procedure among left is to act like a bunch of maniacs standard operating procedure they don't they don't even really bad an eyelash anymore I mean if you're not quite ... yet\nYou're considered mainstream among the Democrats just just shy of anti ... if you're at the protest but you're not wearing all black and going black bloc in the streets like anti does black walk as you know because you listen to this show\nIs a tactic it's not actually at protests group it is wearing black head to toe so that it is more difficult for police to identify you when you cause destruction and engage in violence and also gives a sense of solidarity among what is a near paramilitary like\nGroup that is why black bloc exist that is what black bloc is a thing on the left um\nHillary says you know we can't be civil and what's amazing is we can't be\nYou win or bad things happen I mean if you believe for example\nThat the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a roe v Wade and there are other things you could fall right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them from having the power to enact there will\nUh but Hillary has gotten in the past as we know from the media for very long time that CNN sits down the center Christie on on one pool that Christie on whatever name as sits down with her I just said her name's obviously I Know her name\nI just don't like to say that because in ... it's ... the ah not Christine it's ... and she told a friend of mine was a but they'll call it he'll call Hillary out you don't sit there and and just allow or to get away with allies and the nonsense\nBut on the issue of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment 'cause we're in this me to moment and everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you is going to affect women's perceptions going into the midterm elections and all that stuff\nI'm I'm for us Hillary about her husband Bill Clinton what went on here and I I Want to play the answer for you and then I Want to bring us down to brass tacks place that\nHe said either talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the U.S to see if they didn't have a pet to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your husband have a pet to answer this question I have a pet ... them and how do you see that\nDifferent from what President Trump is being accused of and ... and others today\nWell there is a very significant difference I\nAnd that is the intense [noise]\nLong lasting part as an investigation that was conducted\nIn the nineties [noise] it's sad\nAnd the Republicans starting with President Trump on down I Want to a comparison nation welcome such investigation themselves\n\nIsn't that an incredible sleight of hand from a dishonest and dare I say only ...\nPolitician\nThere's a big difference alright between what happened with Kavanaugh and what happened with Hillary Clinton's husband Bill Clinton one is that his misdeeds\nOccurred while he was president of the United states or\nIn the case of the credible accusations of rape on the record by women he did have sexual interactions with who did know him worth seeing him there was no question about where they were or did you ever actually occur in terms of the date and time and could they have been there all the things that\nWe never get answers for Ford Bill Clinton\nWas accused of rape by Juanita broader Roderick by he was accused of sexual salvo Gennifer Flowers and these women came forward and said that he was a\nPredator a predator and\nSure enough Hillary not only didn't divorce him didn't you know you\nSay that those women should be believed she went on often against those women\nThe difference is not the investigation between cabin all and Clinton the difference\nIs that one of them actually is a predator and the author or the Democrats tried to sue me or as a predator that's the difference but Hillary is show dishonest in so disgraceful that you think she can get away with well one was a long investigation and the other\nYou know there wasn't one of them was being investigated for what he did while president while governor of Arkansas the other was being and being accused of stuff and when he was a Seventeen year old case thirty six years ago but he still thinks she\nCan hit hit back at Trump for quote demeaning women play\nWhat was done last night in the White House with a political rally\nIt further undermined the image and integrity of the court a and that troubles me greatly it saddens me because I ... and\nHas been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government so\nI don't know how people are going to react to it I think given our divides it will pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and those who are against\nWhat the president's been true to form he has insulted attacked demeaned women um throughout the campaign really for many years leading up to the campaign and he's continued to do that or inside the White House\nYou know who else has has demeaned in insulted women folks Hillary Clinton\nWhen it suited her\nAnd you know what else is true and also said here on this show you know ... gonna be in trouble as long as the feminist left in this country embraces Hillary Clinton the feminists left

because you know Libya will be on the human rights council or whatever\nYou know that they they have this\nFall the notion that all nations should be treated as somewhat equal when the truth\nIs that there are some there are some there I say crappy governments out there there is some crap hole governments and then there are some pretty good governments or at least in comparison to the other governments pretty good oh and we shouldn't have to treat them all like they're the same but Sanders year when he talks about promoting a shared prosperity and solidarity\nThat goes beyond any one nations sovereignty the now now you're getting further along into what the progressive and state\nHe is with regard to climate change and and these activities the the fixation on multilateral isn't that you see from a body like the United nations\nRight that's why it's all because they view the UN is essentially a democracy of countries and democracy is a is an almost fetish eyes word among the less because they think that a democracy is an idealized state of all people being equal in all ways\nWhich of course interesting to me is somebody who is a it has an interest in ancient history and and western civilization is if you go back to the ... the earliest democracy or ancient Athens in Greece or they only had a\nVery small percentage of the population that could vote you had to be a landowner you can be a slave there was a whole\nI had to be male obviously going to be ... you had to be a land owning\nA resident of what what essentially be the upper middle class or the upper class to be able to vote in Athens in a very small percentage overall so you know ... the notion of democracy as just everybody gets to vote and they get whatever they want by whatever the majority are ... by whatever the majority\nSays that is not really anything that will be a good government system you can imagine that extrapolating ... even further to what Bernie Sanders and others one of your which is all the countries of the world gets a vote on things and then\nAre held accountable to what all the countries of the world want I don't I don't want to be responsible for what in any way I I don't I don't care what European nations think about\nWhat my rights should be I don't I certainly don't care what Muslim nations think my rights should be I don't care what the nations of East Asia think my rights you know I just got on the list I don't care\nI Am not in any way bound to their notions of uh my protects\nIn in my citizenship under the law a fats and this is where the left starts to they they feel very differently about this they they think of themselves as citizens of the world they think of themselves as as a\nGlobal a global\nPartners in a way in terms of their politics right and Bernie Sanders was saying and we need to create an international progressive\nInternet kind of sounds like folks international now kind of sounds like a group of people that have very ... redistribution is and left wing views or when it comes to government and\nPrivate property and oh that's right the communist [laughter] that's that's what that's what they were ... that was the communist project at the twentieth century by the way the communist now we understand they failed miserably\nIn so many places and and forced hundreds of millions probably billions when you add it all up in just into essentially servitude and misery or because of the bad ideas that are at the center of the communist project but they thought they were doing a good thing just like\nThe lips today I Know I think that they're doing good things oh they're going to help people that are going to make them more equal\nYou know what's what's wrong with that well what's wrong with it is that it never works out that way what's wrong with it is that whether it's the progressive left in this country or hard core communist ... regimes all over the world they refused to accept that the basis of any\nState is in fact the individual not the collective and its relationship to the state\nIs individual rights individual liberty individual property rights these are the building blocks for a truly civilized society\nAnd that is where you start to see the last deviate in the ... you know that that's where you see the let the beating and waste today that I think it's shocking to some people in this country\nThey're willing to they're willing to kick it the load bearing walls of western civilization right now and they'll use these things like climate change and others to get their", "year":
