trying to get people enthusiastic about politics on their side\nMaybe we really just need to take them at their word maybe they actually do believe this stuff\nOr at least enough of them believe it that the party has taken a turn from just being wrong on issues\nTo being dangerous it's one thing to say the Democrats are ignorant of history and refused to admit or allow evidence contrary to their

there's real violence\nAnd that only has to happen once before then the temperature gets raised even more and now the next time people square off in some kind of a public dispute over politics the

thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThat it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive about using that were there very sensitive about saying it because\nThey know that their audience is all a bunch of lips and they don't want the lips to feel like anyone standing and mean about the really devoted lives you know there there's a sympathy\nJust because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean that\nThey despise anti fought in fact I think there are way more Democrats\nAnd you're seeing this now who don't necessarily agree with that he was methods but they agree with the message and they know that the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told hey ah there are there's a problem on the last year and people are acting\nLike maniacs mob maniacs no less that's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it it it reminds me so very much of what was being or what was happening back in the days of ...\nLives matter you guys know what I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these incidents the most probably well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis Missouri\nWhere are these incidents where you had a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind and they were\nBurning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analyst later on doing what\nWell is mostly peaceful protest it was a mostly peaceful protests\n... mostly peaceful protest what is it even mean ... can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten\nAnd there was anybody throwing rocks at cops there was anybody who was letting buildings on fire they were like oh my gosh look the country isn't in turmoil look at the rioters and yet when you flip it around and you have people that are saying they're part of this black lives matter movement\nThen all of a sudden you know they're they're not ... you can't afford them as writers you certainly wouldn't ... what was going on even though it was about race and racial animus and claims of racism and\nNever allowed to call it a race riot on TV but that is what it would have been called decades before\nWhite and black folks aren't that train Kanye West in racial draft okay they've had it with him\nYeah I I got to say I\nI don't know how\nIt is that that segment on CNN is considered up to ... in any way up to that network standards that that's acceptable I how how ... how it is allowed to happen\nOn a cable news show when when keep in mind there's a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago who is a sports caster\nAnd she said something about about boots on he said that he you know I forget what it was exactly but he made some reference to the female Oregon that is\nCalled by some uh books and\nIt was a big like oh my gosh you can't say that I don't see another excuse me so this is like when does it it was a big problem but then you add what just happened there where there's obviously very racially inflammatory language being\nUsed in and people laughing and and mocking Kanye West to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour and people have all these very strong opinions on it but I I think that there was a long crossed there and and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a La Crosse there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time as their grasping for reasons are grasping for for ways to justify or their intolerance of other ideas\nThe the rabbit way which they approach trying to destroy their enemies either ... we have so few celebrities\nOn the right that speak or soap operas alright period and we've so few people that come out and and a spouse conservative principles that with someone of ... a level in celebrity land says anything about being pro Trump each there's this mob that yes there is that word again this mob mentality to tear him down immediately\nIt's one thing if they want to say who cares but think about what a disparity there is in this realm\nYou look every idiot celebrity I Know we talked about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift and uh you know her effort to help the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you know George Clooney I mean name one\nTim Robbins and students around and these these people were all just absolute hardcore left these Alec Baldwin\nAnd it was a really good actor I Wish she wasn't such a comedy in all of them are on this one side and any of that and all the music artist you know this is always the big joke with\nWhenever there's inauguration parties like the Obama inauguration parties where the the top recording artist in the world and the Trump recording artists were\nI don't know who's that guy told me she wasn't he one of them will put a boot in your is that a ... that's a different song actually at a different artists out on\nA I also I like I think it's Clint Black Iraq them up and I roll I don't know there's some great some great country anthems that I still remember up there I should listen to more country music that's that's one thing that's\nThat is that's come out of this conversation that I Can't think of any like if

or deported a man became trapped when a tree ... through his homes Ruth Michael now downgraded to category one hurricane it's now over Georgia\nRepublican just say okay you you you want to play that game we're going to reopen the Hillary email investigation and we're going to have a different a different attorney general a different department of justice looking at what let's see how that goes\nThere is nothing that stop the deejay from doing that there's nothing to stop them from doing it but now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people were operating entirely in bad faith\nThere really aren't any limits on it really ... there are limits on an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows\nBut you do not have the right to a speedy investigation in fact an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on it and bankrupt you some people I Know that some people have actually taking deals meaning if they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial making all stop\nBecause they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about shredding constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion there are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they're going to abuse of I used to be of the mind\nMore of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F ... style can serve I used to be the mind if you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the you know we got our video J. really take a good look now that told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at a at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes the decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges\nLet's see what the what the deal determination is about Hillary's emails this time around all Bach no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that mess\nThat last spring the FBI by the way you know Rand Paul is that a tough year year and a half Rand\nPaul is holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to be a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying stuff you'd think they'd given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data\nIs that as Madison said men are not angels that's what we have the constitution that's where we asked you to get a warrant the information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no constitutional manner to that matter to that data\nAnd yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complaint for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree\nAnd I have to say it's a little concerning the given\nThat now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community or in part weaponized against Trump that there has not been any real change in how these prophecies work or certainly there's been no legislation\nTo prevent this from happening again\nIn remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party this this all happened after we should have been aware\nThat our political opponents in in our own country we're willing to abuse the apparatus of government reporters and purposes and there's been no real change there's ... and said you have Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government is full of some deep state leftist sure completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan and so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not\n\nSeem it as an honor and privilege to bring in my thoughts on

people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is\nReally going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms are just in general what's going on because somebody can answer this question for us over Roy is with us now\nIs the president for the foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes\nEditor over at great to have you hey\nBook so uh first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are are we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about\nTrump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house in the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I look at it pretty closely at this particular question I haven't seen any polling data to suggest that health care right now is motive motivating people to turn out a sort of ever having a obviously is\nA much bigger driver but I Will say that\nIf Democrats are successful retaking the house or whether or not to take us on it they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow whatever at the midterms are gonna be over you notice about your listeners know this is seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about\nThe twenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge truck and what that primary going to be all about it all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the true blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this thought that it she's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning or you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election where is the last positioning itself but where Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nYeah one of the things but it's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on the program in the past\nIs that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care at the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas lawsuit which aims to overturn Obamacare the out by attacking with a pre existing conditions provision\n... and so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance payments because it creates a fish and\nOn for protecting you from that well for me so there is a you know a lot of these rape is a lot of talk about preexisting conditions when I'm\nOn Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know what should we do about pre existing conditions so that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it or not so much about single payer single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party official ... an official position on healthcare once we're heading and it's one\nTwenty you're you're confident that\nI'm certain of it it's just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans want to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections and the last ten years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries on Democratic Party\nIf you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge so every Democrat feels that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically want single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen\nThey do feel sufficiently would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not going to they're not going to deny that they're forcing the air they're going to say yeah I'm forcing but there are all that I'm over each other to talk about how pro single payer there how how\nAccurate worthy early GOP projections that out you know over you've been involved this discussion stretching back for a long time\nBut how accurate were the projections are of how damaging and bad Obamacare would be you know I remember this was like a fiercest political discussion in the country back in the early days the Obama administration\nHas it been\nWhat the Republicans said it would be or is it something more mixed\nDog whistles folks dog whistles another way of saying I'm gonna call Republicans racist for something that's not racist but I can pretend it is if I say it's a dog whistle us the Reverend Al Sharpton who some will remember from when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by Warner Brawley who went on to lose\nIn court a defamation case a federal this she then sexually refuse to pay and it has since moved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to water Brawley a few years ago and found that she was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she\nUh she lost so you can imagine when you hear today from\nPeople say oh are you blaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim they're these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out\nBut let's say focus for a moment on they stop and frisk point because Trump brought this up he gave a speech what was that early on and we mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago\nAnd here's what they say about this they will claim that New York the most visible single place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today\nDemocrat Bloomberg was Democrat he was an independent member remember when he says you those those are those speeches about the snow and then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would\nGo into a little like he'd be like yo soy Mayor Bloomberg God Bless you all\nYou do as little Bloomberg Espanol ... I I that was great that was great those are simpler ties producer Mike Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he's spoken order just let it let New Yorkers know\nThat uh you know\nThe snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you do that was only a scene the Blasio coming I Know we we didn't know what we had\nYou see the Blasio are read by the way he's so there's the mayor of New York city in case anybody a needs to be told that a major city hit somebody ... talking about housing for the homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean that work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIt because you like that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess per hour we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real lotta stretching it a lot of electrical\nAnd then when somebody comes up to them in the gym is a public official he gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a sniffy ... anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he\nWas the one or he's going to run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race he had stop and frisk\nWhat a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on\nA reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nA large number of these stop and frisk the hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you had a disproportionate number of a black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons\nAnd some people say it's racist interesting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a\nAs it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped last\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share\nOverall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that it looks bad and the and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crowd it continued downward trajectory on crime part\nIs that reality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know this is like showing up in in the in the final stages\nOf something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like it was already happening in the ... he was already happening\nThe only point I think that's very fair to make on this is that conservative along did say to get rid of stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime\nAnd we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of the background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago at ACLU types at all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing to stop and frisk in Chicago nobody\nHas any ideas for how to make Chicago a less\nCrime ridden place I mean that's the number of shootings people think of ... and I look that obviously is going to get the most headlines because\nWhen you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed or you know more than that in some way to get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weekends with forty fifty people shot you look at the number shot it in a low it's in a low thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stab than any given year\nThat's a lot of people that are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear\nFrom lives and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill TV show oh you're from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school at come on this isn't serious\nBut they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that you know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single German or whether it a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are\nIn a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be\nAnd that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household the crime rate is essentially the same across all\nUh all all cultures and all ethnic background so you can't have the structural conversation about why this balance the place of Chicago you can't talk about more aggressive policing and say that's racist\nAnd at the end of the day this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being ... and they're protecting the civil rights of minorities but you're just getting out of having more people getting shot and they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton\nHe's running around and demagogue ing well sharp as what it does drop and runs around and and demagogues and things but that\nThat he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from anyone in the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away liberals would prefer to call Republicans\nRacist and sharp and to to say their dog whistling then to seriously consider proposals that would save lives and this was that there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in a numbers ... numbers based policing a cops that\nAll that was done and the liberals were howling and shrieking or that too but then they realized oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen to Chicago\nI Hope they managed to get this violence situation on the control that are not going to hold my breath because Democrats are in charge [noise] global

support peacock\nOn an airplane with her and I thought you know as crazy as that is\nAt least give her points for creativity because you yeah you can obviously bring your emotional support elephant on the plane to bake not off like a lot of leg room but could you bring a peacock theoretically on a plane with you yes you could now people are starting to crack down on this\nAnd and I got to say that there is a I've got mixed emotions about it\nThere was a woman who tried to get on a flight from frontier airlines in Orlando, Florida or just a few\nDays ago and she held this flight up for two hours you know why John she wanted to bring on her emotional support squirrel and sure enough they had a problem with that because there is a policy\nThat frontier airlines does not allow rodents aboard flight so they they are anti wrote inch at frontier airlines little harsh harsh\nBut I've got to say if you're trying to expand your your horizons for what could be a ... a good pet turns out that I Know that rats believe it or not and this is really this is weird for some folks rats are pretty smart and can make good pets\nWhich when you see them in the subway to do here in New York City you think to yourself why would anybody ever want to have one of those they look terrifying to carry all kinds of diseases but if you keep rats clean they are pretty smart and can make affectionate pets so I Would think would be in the same category so that she does a part of me John it's like hey\nMaybe she's got a really close bond with this horrible maybe this oral\nIs very meaningful to her and you can't separate a person from their emotional support squirrel but then there's the other side of me\nThat had to wait for hours and hours just last week for Southwest Airlines flight that was delayed John are we supposed to take off as a one hour flight from Las Vegas to San Diego\nAnd it was going to take off at eight thirty in the morning you know when that flight actually took off seven pm at night almost a twelve hour delay for not for weather weather as weather right that's\nThat's a that's got deciding that you're going to have a bad day or no for mechanical issues and I can tell you that\nLose patience very quickly when I'm In that airport lab not lounge airport area yeah the little chairs\nYou set up at all face each other to kind of creepy sit there you have to look at somebody else you tend not to be staring at them but you're staring at them\nAnd they don't want you to obviously you you don't want to lose your temper\nUh but what can you do there's not much you can do show on the one hand I feel like emotional supports whirl I'm sympathetic on the other hand I feel like if I were there and I was told that somebody was holding up my flight for a couple of hours so that they could have their emotional support squirrel handy\nOr I might make some squirrel could Bob I might just lose it\nAnd I bet squirrels probably not a particularly tasty meat but I Would figure I'd find out one way or the other that squirrel that that emotional supports world probably be chosen I'm going to get all the hay bales competed now but\nWe eat we eat out all kinds of animals you know I obviously cow and\nPay pigs are smart I've actually hung out with pet pigs before on micro pigs that are kind of a fun thing it it ... why do we draw the line John at squirrels why do we discriminate against emotional support squirrels but we think the cat somehow the superior species I don't have an answer for you the\nTruth is you give me the choice between a pet squirrel or pet cat I don't know squirrels much more portable or they are good at\nHoarding their own food you know they buried a little acorn stunt stuff there there's a lot to recommend squirrels anyway have you know the emotional support animals scam is looks like it's coming to it and I have friends who have gone through the whole process of getting a little best for their dog did you get an emotional support best or that's what it says a service dog\nAnd you have to be allowed in everywhere with service dog because of people who have\nReal issues that the service dog is addressing now there's been a little bit of a\nOf an explosion of people that say that whatever the dog like they have a service Chihuahua and they put a little vest on it and I'll say service dog when really they just mean it serves there need to have their pooch with them at all times that's not really what they're going for service dogs", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "11"}
