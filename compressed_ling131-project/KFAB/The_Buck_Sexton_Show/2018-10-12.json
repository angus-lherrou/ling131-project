know it's like don't get toward new\nUh you know we we shouldn't get too enamored with the notion of having a very prominent wealthy black celebrity like ...\nSo friendly and familiar with the president and working with him on policy issues by the way\nYou know you you can say this about a lot of people in a lot of different situations are we allowed to embrace that he's saying things that we like and pushing ideas that we liked now or do we have to say well a long time ago he he had or even ten years ago whatever was he had a different perspective so would that invalidate same now\nThat's not a standard that we hold anyone's you've never mind to a celebrity\nSo you know there's a little bit of I don't know if you'd say trust but verify but there are some applause with caution here I think in order for the whole Conyers situation and then there's also the everybody just\nNeeds to calm the hack down our meeting was acting like Trump went and played ... holes with Kim Jong on which let's be honest I could probably happen sometime pretty soon but they were acting like this was some crazy thing that he had\n... to talk to him and say oh he's profane the uh profane the office of the\nPresidency by doing this by cursing in there you know this is the same office literally V. office the oval office where Bill Clinton did a whole lot more in a way of profane stuff than have a guest who cursed\nBut there are no standards the media really applies to any there's there's no there's no truth necessary for what they say oh they just want to find ways to hate and to criticize the president and there's always ways to do that here's a perfect example of what I'm Talking about John of Brazil\nWhom I managed to a debate a few times in the CNN and who was always treated with tremendous deference to I mean they really love Donald Brazil at CNN so I was supposed to be there to get\nA buck slapped if you will ... or ... ... you know what I mean fuck yet box slap 'em and\nTurn I actually managed to turn the tables on her and she told me she interrupted me once and told me to stop interrupting her was a pretty amazing thing I don't know some of you may be even seen that but I was never impressed with her so she\nIt was treated out and she is treated out the following in response is kind of member this was a I think she was she was DNC chair German and then she gave the questions to Hillary remember it got fired from CNN\nShe treated at the following in response to this whole commenting today\nKanye West has set us back one hundred and fifty five years wish Sojourner Truth could've met with him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the oval office Brock Obama never would have become president with this crap\nBut let's meet ... by voting for Democrats I mean the end of that is fine but she wants to propagandize or a Democrat she's totally free to do that\nBut just say the ... has set back uh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in your mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community\nSet us back a hundred and fifty five years well this one does the math on that it seems\nA bug she's making a pretty pointed reference there and how is that what a reasonable rational person would say here you have\nA world famous black millionaire in the oval office embracing the president of the ... literally embracing I'm giving him a hug\nAnd sharing ideas with them and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world this is a man talking about Trump now Tanya probably thinks he's the leader of the free world\nAmong other things among being a deity uh but ... there's no ... there's no way\nAny sentient normal human being could look at this and so yeah that's degrading for any group of people never mind for black Americans I mean this is just the oval office and I think that the way they get to this is two fold one today they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also\nThey don't really accept the Trump is the president they they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions and the way that they've been willing to cast aside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the media and\nIt's because they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud or he is\nA ... an interlopers he's a pretend or to the throne if you will and so he doesn't deserve any of the respect that one would give president he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself\nAnd so if that where your perspective if you were that\nDo looted with with rage or not disconnected from the truth\nThen I could see how maybe you'd feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report is demeaning but joining a normal person that's just crazy it's just crazy that is the most accurate way\nTo describe it and there were some meltdowns today there were some meltdowns\nThat were incredible I mean ethic

today\nIt's nice that a lot of them were usually with the research staff to help them get put together an eight hundred page book that generally people don't read but I don't really need to hear their

impeachment is in fact a parallel process to the legal process that the left\nCan control if they take the house and that's what they were gearing up for so whenever we try to have the argument that\nTrump was not found guilty when it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office\nA ... which is essentially whatever the house of representatives decides he is guilty of\nNow they can't remove him from office\nBut the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be that President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the racism\nAnd massage any insects isn't all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say\nAnd that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling

will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward who would take the fifth and we would say that's absolutely the right thing to do\nSo it's not just that he's taking the fifth but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general of people who are tied to the da da da da da da and the kids\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump and the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full

that's a lot of money that people\nI think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump\nAs I've said many times because he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more now that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they want about Trump it's when it's at the moment we should get rid of him\nBut they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to do such a strong job in that position now forget about they'll say his tone is terrible he's a racist and oh my God you know bring up all the stuff\nThe

some of them have gone right up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well which genes are that they can say they're not never dropped but for all intents and purposes they are a but why is it that they\nUm they hate this president so much and that there are so many people who come from\n... not exclusively government backgrounds\nBut I I think come from backgrounds where they've spent time in government and they're of the system and all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one she isn't supposed to be able to do this\nAnd I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government who really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management of that\nOther people Jones' hat right at that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nYou know you have to be in government to understand government that's that's essentially the distillation of this point you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been the beltway inside or where you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a

who just has existed in the private sector and the real world\nAnd hasn't made this cross over into public service and I I don't think I'm over stadium when I say that there's a real resentment of

people can live on the electric companies have been\nA terrific they're already working the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric ... ah the roads are being claimed right now they're being ah for the most part they're open enough to get the electric companies and\nAnd a lot of electricity is already back on some of the false electricity is already found that's in Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration is showing\nCompetence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins we've really fast\nA but one interesting side of this and first priority the first thought of everybody is getting help to those who needed and making sure that there's no or minimum loss of life and they're going to lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost\nA but hurricane Michael a hit and they're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement a gentleman's agreement among politicians that when something like this goes on you will you will see the political attack ad that was not the case here folks\nAh you had Ron dissent is his rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC\nThat is trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they called them a shady millionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire it sounds like you're the kind of a millionaire that has parties on his yacht and has a little too much fun so\nI think that sounds good to me but they're they're running into these attack ads um and and people are pointing out that that this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect remember running attack at the ... in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting better by this hurricane and they're running ads\nSpecifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians were I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm has passed\nAnd in this case the uh the candidates running these ads even while the while the storm was was overhead and people were\nTrying to either bad down the hatches or or or wait until they can return to their homes by the weight of the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home what would it feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with all the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also\nA illuminates how tight these border races are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the Senate race\n'em and they're going to try to\nExtrapolate from that for the implications for the presidential race and twenty twenty you know the idea here being that Gillum who is a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida was\nI'll see that as you're posing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be\nA but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic African American\nUm and and that's what the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see you know minority representation and they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives ... we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nUh identity politics is a is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff but the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they are getting slammed by category for hurricane\nTo take the ads are taken negative ads off the air so\nI think that gives you a sense of aware that all is and uh I I Do believe Scott's going to pull it out but you guys going to make is going to make a close\nVery close oh I've I've got something by the way that
