Kavanaugh was president for gang rapes and that there were gang rape parties in the DC area sweat it also well I'll break down all of the reasons why she's\nI don't think she's mistaken Dr Ford may be a mistake and I think she's a very troubled woman I think that she has a lot of issues and I think that she may which she makes clear by telling us She's got as you should just happens to blame her she was on Brett Kavanaugh but I think she's a she was completely apart from Kevin ... but she may very well believe what she said\nAnd as I've told you hear\nI Witness testimony leads to a lot of innocent people going to prison I with his testimony can be very problematic on its own\nUm but sweat Nick is not confused sweat Nick is not somebody who just is\nTo be ... and ... might be making a mistake that's destroying someone's life\nHere's just a part of the kinds of things that she was saying this interview and then and then I'll tell you why I Know that she's lying and then we have to evaluate what was the third person that the media treated as serious and said oh gosh this needs to be investigated if she's a liar\nDo we get to look at the second person who also has a shady story and say you know maybe there's a pattern here maybe all of these leftist females who are coming forward\nAt a moment of peril for roe v Wade maybe they're doing it for political reasons or we're we're not supposed to have that conversation bowl I Want to have that conversation 'cause a man's life his reputation his honor his dignity\nHand in the balance hang in the balance and day a Supreme Court seat hangs in the balance as well\nHere's some of the sweat Nick interview that aired yesterday play to\nWhat he said well I'll tell what happened when it happened to me I didn't put tendency to gather that Ali said boy outsider rooms congregated together sort of like an outlet\nAnd I didn't know what was that ... ... ... ... a lot of laughing I'm falling in line outside or wind that

say from ... to have [noise]\nI I it's just too coincidental\nOr are they read something popping the audio that we we've got we've crossed wires there for a second year sweat next talking let's not look at what she says that are trying to play the ... minute interview it's not worth it because he's just a liar I I can tell you what she's lying about\nShe's saying that she thinks that there were gang raped her she's making the allegation that there were gang rapes going all these parties because there were boys huddled outside of rooms as she ever been to a party with teenagers were drinking beer they all huddled together has she ever been to a party were teenagers are you do have a drink seven fondue whatever they're doing\nThey clump in little groups all over the place I remember this I used to be cool I used to go to parties\nThere was nothing about what she says it makes it as a game of she claims that she was raised in the ... I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation aside I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she's been raped her\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nShe doesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she's claimed that she was drugs but then why is he bringing his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then because he happened to be at this party by what I don't believe she ever even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete an author I Know\nThis is a fabrication now does she pepper and some details here or there about if she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in the Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense\nShe went from saying in this interview that Kavanaugh spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes to punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of lemons but that means everybody's getting drunk these are high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this up you know is adding a little adding a little boost to it to make a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't route the the big\nBowl of punch because that means he ... himself and all the other guys and girls that everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you have to drink from that too as a bad idea so her story is\nIdiotic doesn't make any sense\nFabrication though that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this\nShe doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated it's you can't keep it straight\nShe claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties no no they ... I went to a a Catholic school or private school in Manhattan we used to do parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and\nNot really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird\nAnd she added that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's change things from her sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kinda she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of cabinet she's in her twenties and she's going to parties and Fifteen and sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens but people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls were being roof eat and raped gang raped\nThey call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and\nWould be much stronger position to take action\nOr would feel much stronger position socially when their party if you know Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought you know I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands with is just on the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying\nAnd that interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster anyone is still believes this really turned into an intelligence test\n'cause you you can't J. O. know emotionally I'm really connected to her no she's a liar so if you're not smart enough to figure that out I don't know what to say\nTwo thoughts on this and then when we got we got so much more to the Senate Democrats are they're scrambling to keep this whole thing a lot because they know they know now they've mortgage all their credibility all their decency they've acted like total ... to try to stop gap and all they know this\nI Wonder if they don't manage to stop him and they look like even bigger clowns in the process\nNow they've exposed themselves but it's still early we've got a few days left who knows what they've got up their sleeves when you have no dignity or under protect you got a lot of options that's what the Democrats have a lot of options\nSomething I Want to note on this they\nAre looking like they're going to have to make a decision soon about whether they're going to bring charges I think against people for making sworn are sworn declarations that are false and then there'll be this whole oh but she's a victim she's a victim no no she's a fabricate or they're sweating the woman is a fabricated\nAnd until she provides evidence or witnesses I Am very comfortable saying that she has neither she has stories that don't make sense she has political motive she's a very checkered past lots of problems here\nShould people who make these allegations to ruin lives and to play the dirtiest of politics to be held accountable absolutely\nAbsolutely not only should we vote cabin all through we should be looking to prosecute those with a lot in this process and oh by the way also a master of a Nazi\nAnd his ability to ... to practice law should also be looked at here\nEight for for nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred Bach freedom from Las Vegas today my friends much more common say with news radio\nOr living [noise]\n\nDo you have something you want to say but feel you just can't express it especially on today social media perhaps it's because you don't have a safe place where your opinions matter and where they can truly be hurt that's why I'm happy to tell you about a new alternative media site Snoopy dot com\nMaybe is an unbiased platform that's all about conversation and community maybe not only encourages freedom of expression\nOh look and see the look on the bright side let's blow drying more time texting or D show empathy mom you really don't have\nTo kind of it\nAs a parent there are no perfect answer to Britain do you have to be perfect to be a perfect parents\nOut of the teams in for care or metal phone for more information contact you got to believe that you got to believe dot org\nA public service announcement from the U.S department of health and Human Services for the dock us gifts and the ad council\n[noise] let's go inside the mind of a ten year old I should\nEarring did I I like hearing Gabby has those ... urine I Need to ask her why she got that it that's just what you would not be a damn\nMcCain laughter for me by collapse Sarah yeah but then they can and will be like why don't you just curious how acts just like we can't allow Sarah ... actually a great name I Wish I was calling to Kayla there's like\nAn ... a night class hey why not hitting the ground and to you about ... oh yeah the pound I forget sometimes because name rainiest like busy you know\nIf there's pizza at school tonight\nSometimes can be tough to get through it but it's not impossible always make sure they're wearing your seatbelt even off shore drive's remember you have to you have the\nNever give up until they buckled on a message from the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council listening for car got gum slash Pittsburgh love more information on how far can you see that\n...

she's out there because it's a reminder of the same people that want to school to you and say Trump's not presidential Trump a shady business dealings I don't look like Trump's tweets\nHillary will do

that if she was going to ride his coat tails into her own power she had to back him up destroy some women so she did it\nBut I guess\nNow he lacks the temperament or\nSo when you fight back that's the

because there is no evidence\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there's the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about these new developments we found out overnight and leave the Donald with ... cabin all through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need and has the either the Asian because there are a lot of allegations and wait for it really are about how he behaves Lenny is drunk so that is very relevant and the trail of himself as actively choir boy\nOr is there much contradicted by his ... for example in college and some people who knew him and I go why we need an FBI investigation why I'm calling from one for like ... ...\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that senator who wrote it was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think she's the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\n\nWe need an FBI investigation that Kavanaugh because you might have thrown ice in someone's face during a bar fight\nThirty years ago thirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron\nReally don't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator she\nCan't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher nope you're up in our ...\nTotal embezzle total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that talking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you you got people that have Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and it was a front row and he's a he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitution list and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into the incident of Nineteen eighty four whenever it was\nNo that's not serious New York times during a peace right now on how he was part of a like party planning or something back in the day in New York Times doing that base whoa oh gosh\nHe was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and his social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times it's been reduced to it\nJoke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as\nA quote reporter when in July before any of this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he poses to civil rights\nAnd women's rights I'm sure to of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that\nBut by creating this storyline of temperament\nAnd oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's all about\nGetting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree by the flakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open this story line you see how it goes all we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented partners in assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around him and the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing all that\nFlake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's gone up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yes you'll receive a lot of\nViciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger is not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really from people but he's playing the long game of I Want to get a book\nOr a book deal from you know Simon and Schuster or whomever you know a big big big publishing house that's\nThat's what flakes game is year so that's why I I'm concerned I don't know how the votes will go I'm not\nI have zero confidence in their ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from it\nBecause it is salacious that you could definitely say it is it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA but it did\nI I have noticed All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man or their things in there essentially telling you the sweating it gives a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in\nThere though bottom\nLine is the woman is crazy that's that's\nThe bottom line uh and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists in Reagan Airport I see this and and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard\nThis line you know how many women have to be assaulted before you believe women\nThis is a this is a fundamental problem with the whole left wing approach here\nEight eight collective version of justice or a collective is the approach to justice that's at the heart of all I Want to address that when we come back and then we'll talk about the mid germs and where I think this is going in terms of red wave blue wave all that stuff third our get into the economy and\nThe latest on on jobs trade U.S Mexico Canada deal lots and lots of stuff coming team I'll be right back\nThe FBI calls home titles that one of the fastest growing crimes brace yourself because having your credit card stolen is nothing compared to the hell you're in for once an identity thief takes control your homes title everything's stored online these days including the title to your home that means that domestic and international cyber thieves or hunting American homeowners because we've got a lot of equity\nIn our homes and the bad guys use that to borrow money they\nTake you off your home site on the place you with an alias then they borrow every penny they can using your homes equity in stick you with the payments you won't know until you get a late payment notice identity theft programs insurance policies don't protect you\nOnly home title lock safeguards your home titled from cyber thieves and hackers\nWere just pennies today home title walk protects my most valuable asset my family's home register now for a free analysis and discovery of your homes title has been compromised that's a hundred dollar value free visit home title locked dot com again that's home title lock dot com news radio\n[noise]\n\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's home\nTo buy homes fines or helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the pro check their ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free to you do it at home at ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nHow does one never missed a customer again with customers called sex or email expressed to me automatically engages in with your digital content simple test flyers coupons menus\nAnd I can't think of anything I mean you sound much like taking to the doctor when I broke my flight leading me alone when I wanted to be alone and now as a grown up I'm thankful\nFor being able to take care of you like air mom for taking idiot therapies for understanding from time to simply want to be alone rules change without us noticing that is why AARP it gives you the information to provide even better care for your loved one is a A R P dot org slash caregiving brought to you by eight or ...\nI was drinking two leaders of vodka a day around the clock just so I could actually go to work and function when I came to teen challenge I found hope that I haven't ever had and I never would have thought that could be possible\nMake that tax deductible vehicle donation now to teen challenged and help out in Omaha Council Bluffs Lincoln Omaha metropolitan area family that really need the help and it's so easy we do all the work go online at TC mid dot org that's D.C Mitt dot org or called eight eight eight three or four hope\nI wasn't prepared to be a caregiver to mom I had no idea how hard it would be one I Would need to know things I never thought I was like how to improve removed and wait for me to stay positive\nLuckily I found the caregiving resource center from A.

a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the Senate him out and not in the house\nI'm looking wave ... isn't that interesting\nRepublican wave is it possible folks that just as we saw on twenty sixteen\nThe G O P and the era of Trump could greatly defied the experts in the expectations in this upcoming election I don't want to get your hopes up and I I kinda want everybody listening this to be fired up and\nBe mad mad people people who are or annoyed about what's going on they're\nLikely or to show up and vote people that are happy to get a little complacent you know with the status quo they figure out things are good things will stay good well what are you seeing in the cabinet debacle is that Democrats cannot be trusted with power you can't have these people in charge you can't do it\nHave to stop them\nFrom being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that it\nCould go either way and we're over a month out from election right our way of my as my date yeah oh no yeah month and a couple of days over a month out from election day Senate ... this is where everyone starts saying the same thing it's an eternity in politics Bob well\nChill it all comes down to turn out you know\nLobby blah all the same stuff a lot of political pundits is not telling the same thing as people keep asking me I I mean I certainly hope they're probably going to win but and you know what they're probably going to do it it's not like I think the world's going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems anymore because\nPolitics is interesting it's about human interaction and\nA way of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do some things that makes sense for all of us\nRight but at the end of the day it doesn't determine who you are what your value is that this is the problem with the Democrats left they get show personally wrapped up in her party and\nAll that stuff I mean I I'm wrapped up in principles of their ideas that really matter to me or you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm giving a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me\nI think the geo peas in a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job it's not perfect not not beyond reproach but yeah there's some very very positive things that are happening that that's\nOne point I wanted to make here and in terms of what we've seen with Kavanaugh I I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact I it doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that this will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has\nTo be said and that means preventing Democrats I'm taking the house Democrats take the house it's going to turn into\nOne long endless investigation and impeachment fight that's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no one no policy\nAgenda they're going to be ... we'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't\nHave that could be the difference maker in the midterms I don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats that women will turn out in huge numbers if Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe the capital's a bad guy and\nA Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nThe women who really take that to heart and are mobilized to vote as a result of it have Kavanaugh anyway this is like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and metal decide well you decided before\nAny there's even if you decided before the hearings happened to you know coups and find sign that we're never going to vote for this guy\nIs all this is all the charade it's all ... Democrats as forget about the due process for the allegations of sexual impropriety they made a complete mess of the normal Amish Senate hearings right they they made it\nRidiculous just to sit down and the Senate and asked this guy some questions he had all these crazy protesters and all\nSorts of man so I I Would like us to be able to move past\nThis as a country as quickly as possible but only only with Kavanaugh's confirmation and move past it doesn't mean forget just means you don't have to keep re litigating this every day because we should not forget this this was the last laid bare\nThis was the the progressives showing us the dark underbelly of what they're really all about which is just pure naked power grab nothing else nothing else really factors into the equation\nThey have ideas for what the state should be doing and they want to be the ones that are implementing those ideas how they get their what they have to do\nDoes not matter and that's what's\nLed us to this

a faith [noise]\n\nEspecially if you're a what the person is doing is the more difficult thing to do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do 'cause that's what they're going to do a this was not the easiest thing for Jeff like to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just to vote\nFor a cap not to get them out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that took whether or not you agree with that that was gutsy thing to do it because it made\nEvery Republican in the Senate mad at him\nTapper is the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThese Steven cold there show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of courage that is called cowardice but notice how this spring\nThey're trying to you and this is very oh tap are very stylish meant news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who wants to stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was Jeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's seductive these are powerful cultural institutions and especially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life you'd be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way\nCan pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that's what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concern with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows that if he were to have gone along and do the right thing she would be in tremendous hot water right now with\nLast with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself I'm\nStill not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the elite again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was this ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham inflate knew it was a ...\nSo what did flake do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw rose funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day and what he had already said in the morning same day\nLike is a self interested coward in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the ad because what he's doing is just created additional risk for a man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been slime\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake Tapper\nDoesn't understand apparently that's what Jake Tapper\nDoesn't know yeah there was a hard thing for me do it was a hard thing for him to do for the few days but he'll get criticism from the right\nIt's much easier thing for him to do for the rest of his life when he's going to want to be at the country club or he's going to want to able to go and get a contributor shape at MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and defend\nUh what did the process here of getting an FBI investigation was total and complete garbage I just want a note choppers got an entirely wrong that's not surprising you know top are always on the on the cold there show always

open and honest about it and say oh no I Know I'm not Native American but I claimed it\nI think I'm a\nI think I'm about two percent according to my brother's ancestry DNA I think I'm two percent so good I claim Native American status I'm I'm not exactly sure I don't I don't know but it's worth a shot\nBut I don't think Warren speaking of a shot I don't think Warren's got a shot and the fact that she's even talking about this for twenty twenty just goes to show you wow Democrats have a very weak bench right now\nAlso this notion that she needs to turn the country around and I I keep returning to this notion to this point\nBecause I I have to tell you I'm I'm sitting here and I keep saying to myself what exactly is the Democrats hate so much about what's happening around us well what is really their objection again we're not starting wars in countries we don't need to be at war in\nWe don't have some\nYou know we we don't have the worst thing happened in this country now so crazy the Democrats are just the truth\nThere's nothing that's going on right now that you say to yourself oh my gosh this doesn't stop I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what kind of shape\nAre going to be a no that's that's not reality reality is that overall the country is doing quite well\nOverall the country is on a very solid trajectory and you can say it destroys the strongest economy certainly since the year two thousand so it almost Twenty years some people just strongest economy more like forty or fifty years really strong account so I I have to ask\nWhat does she think needs to be turned around executive Trump tweets out mean things what what part of\nWhat she's saying here is based in reality versus what part of this is just demagoguery what the usual stuff would expect from what\nI did it twice twice when\nShe has no charisma no charm nothing and men people are going to get really testy with all of the mockery that's going to come her way for claiming that ... you know she's not\nI Would look there's nothing there's no I'm not trying to say that being a school's not a good thing but she didn't have the academic pedigree to become a Harvard professor without it's not like it was a close call like she went to an Ivy League law school and then she wanted to be a professor at Harvard she went to a state school in New Jersey not a particularly you know selective state school again not\nTrying to be a jerk but she used cars and you can get a great education folks at any of these schools now really it's all up it's all up you it's all based on\nWhether you do the work I guess that's a that's a conversation we can get into a another time but yeah I really do look at this now and and try to get a sense as to whether Warren's going to run and twenty twenty and I hope she does man Trump will have a field day with her and it also means that Trump's\nA shoe in my opinion for four more years roll calls up next on [noise]\n\n\nWarning if
