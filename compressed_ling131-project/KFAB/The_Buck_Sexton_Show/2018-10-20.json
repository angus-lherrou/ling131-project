that could affect them in terms and that's all by design but you notice they say things like Trump just stokes fear about this it's all about Trump's stoking fear fear people in the south Europe if you're around people that will say you know anyone who's non why did they say all the same things all the time\nWhat is the Democrats delusion that somehow we never get to that question we never get\nTo post when every year at the answer is what we hear a lot of fiery rhetoric a lot of you know what we need we need comprehensive immigration reform right what we need is an immigration system that works the immigration system is broken\nThey say all that stuff what does that mean what does it mean how do you fix other than amnesty do they want the border continue being as it is okay what's not even get into it as something fish\nUh open ended and and widespread let let's take it at the very straightforward level of what you Democrats want when it\nTo this caravan of people what is their plan should the United states government say oh okay four thousand people who are just going to show up in a mass at the border\nShouldn't be allowed to stay in the country we should just bring them in\nA ... I I think that is what they say oh that the process for some they're all from Honduras well we know they're going to say you know where to hunters is very violent we don't wanna go back we just want to be in America okay and you say All right ... well\nYou know we've got one for four thousand more people yes of course we've got run for when you say rooms but what does that really mean\n\nYeah we've got the space is late we've got a lot of open spaces country but people need resources and they have you know they want they want political representation they it's it's not just to be in a place it's also to be supported in that place say okay but we got obviously were very wealthy country that enough for four thousand okay fine\nWhat about the next ten thousand oh that that that's not no I Would want to ask Democrat members of Congress asked Democrats senators what do we do in the next gang that shows up is I don't mean gangs and like gang bangers but you know what I mean the next or\nA group that acts and mass of people they call it a caravan right this is the tournaments as they try to use ... what do we do in the next\nCaravan shows up of of ten thousand people\nOkay we're going to like we've got to let them in doing letting the next ten caravans of ten thousand people each after that\nWhy would anybody why would anybody wait\nYears in years pay thousands of dollars and deal with all kinds of annoying headaches and I know they're not it's not fun and a lot of times it's not fair why do that if all you have to do is show up in Mexico\nWalk to the border and say I'm fleeing a very dangerous situation in my home country well what were your papers while I'm undocumented\nI Can't prove that well even speak Spanish no no I don't well how do I know you're from Honduras or you don't but why don't we figured out the immigration courts let me into America oh I get my court date in\nFour years great I'll be sure to show up for that one see then\nWhy would anyone waste their time right that this is the way to do it just go to Mexico show up at the border but show up in a big group because the optics of it which is what they're playing off of here are oh we can't turn away this big group that looks really mean\nNow we're going to have a well we don't want to look mean immigration policy every other country in the world has a we don't want to look mean immigration policy or other they're willing to have a we will look mean immigration policy that don't tell people you get 'em in\nEvery other countries there's no sorry you know just get to come and stay here and say well you know America is different alright there's there are other wealthy countries that there are plenty of places people could go\nPlenty of countries they could go to um people in Honduras that want to flee Honduras they could very easily head south and go to Columbia they could go to other countries that are not a nearly as violent right now and obviously there's a lot of violence in Venezuela but not nearly as violent is what's going on and Honduras\nCertainly they wouldn't constantly be in fear of their lives do people want to come to America because we're we're we're a sweet deal if you can stay here\nWe're a a product that people want America\nIs something special\nBut it's not going to stay special if the Democrats have their way and I I Do get frustrated with the demagoguery around this issue because if if it is mean to police the border if it has major separate parents from their children at the border but his media detain people come to the country illegally\nDo we just stopped doing that\nIs is no longer a law has this essentially been written out of the books because nobody wants to see cheerful CNN reporter is like oh my God it's so horrible what was going\nI don't know\nBy the way the cost of our porous border\nCan be measured now by the tens of thousands of people who are dying every year from opioid overdoses which are not despite what the left or something and now a predominantly a problem of pharmaceutical companies in over prescribing and dirty doctors and all that that had been a problem\nBut now it is overwhelmingly illegal drugs including illegal pharmaceutical grade drugs like fencing on ... and all that come through the southern border\nShe got thousands and thousands of Americans who are dying because we don't have good enough for security this is the biggest national security challenge we face in in our existence right now as a country\nAnd what are the Democrats offering nothing more\nImmigration courts to bring more people in faster what do we do about the cartels what do we do about the fact\nThat our legal immigration system is starting to look like a joke oh that's not a problem they really want to they really want to manager deal with they have no answers\nThe fact is we had four dead Americans what kind of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night I decided they'd go kill some Americans what difference at this point does it make how much\nDo you miss her to you know we want her to give you a little mom does the so you remember what it was like when you had to deal with Hillary all the\nTime [noise]\nAh yes Hillary you've probably saying to yourself like most normal people would oh Hillary has run for president unsuccessfully twice there is no way that she would be show\nDiluted and so self involved in so self important and Meg Whitman article that\nShe would run again but all I Do listen to that ... and fellow sometimes on the radio he can be quite an impish little little dude and uh she has been saying for the last year regularly that Hillary\nClinton may run again and I keep saying I Know everyone can say I'm Crazy I Know everyone's going to\nTell me I'm nuts but oh guess what a you know it's government first time that I can think of at least twenty Eighteen you have a top\nA Clinton aide Felipe rains who's a veteran spokesmen and console yes they are saying that yes it's a it's possible\nHere's resent his political quote it's curious why Hillary Clinton's name isn't in the mix either conversational or and former former polling as they twenty twenty candidate\nShe's younger the Donald Trump by year she's younger than Joe Biden by four years isn't that she's run before\nThis would be Bernie Sanders second time and by the third time is it lack of support jihad sixty five million people vote for her it was a mistake for Democrats to punish Clinton from mistakes you made and twenty sixteen\nShocking last up to her being a failed candidate isn't over simplification she is smarter than most tougher than most she could raise money easier than most it was an absolute fight to the debt\nWhen asked about the likelihood of a running rains responded it is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it is not\nZero now let me tell you something right now are there is a very very higher than zero much more realistic possibility than they're willing to talk about uh [noise] that\nShe will run and that's why they're starting it's as you are right now in terms of what the public really we're expecting one what they're trying to do is just start start rehabilitating that perception they have to take it upon themselves to\nMake the case which is what I hear the Hillary what am I Am and telling all along there's an entire apparatus of people around her who\nBelieved that the height of their careers would come when she won that election they have not gone away they have not achieve what they set out to achieve which was to get those different jobs they all have the drapes picked out for their officers they were ready to go\nAnd that was all taken from they believe taken from them by\nThe Russians I they believe taken from them by this uh this on hold the alliance between ... and Trump and all these terrible shenanigans that went on behind the scenes or so the narrative as I've been telling you is that the only way to set right what happened in the past the only way to make it all better\nWas if they were able to now bring Hillary back and make her the president yes she will be the third time around but give Felipe rain some credit here he's telling the truth about her age about number of times running it makes more sense for who Hillary to run that Biden or Bernie\nMakes more sense first woman candidate won all those she beat burning in the last primary but this is also how desperate they are for a candidate that the case for him\nThe ... from a Democrat perspective the case for Hillary is more rational\nAnd the case for most of the other candidates that the Democrats are thinking about right now and they\nJust you know what it is they just can't stomach it they just feel like they had to just show down a lot of nasty stuff\nIn order to push her once again after Obama came out of nowhere in that primary defeat or they they have to do this or they had to do it and there was a recognition I think deep down with a lot of them that they may\nHave to do to get and they will they will I'm telling you I think the chance that Hillary\nClinton runs right now you're really to give Vegas odds on this is more along the lines of twenty five percent I'm not saying it's likely but I'm saying it's a serious serious\nShot that she decides to run and mad wouldn't that just be while we can replace the twenty six you know election in twenty twenty\nAnd all the same cast of characters all over again [noise] I mean I I'm not sure if people would know it would be a ... it would be a

of new verifiable are facts and I've got to say um you know that's a ... it's just going to be\nAt the end exactly what I thought which is that they the Saudis are going to say that this was a rogue operation but beating up on Trump was clearly what a lot of this has been about all along and I you know and and Bernie Sanders sometimes I get a little caught up it was like the only person who's ...\nWho's like burn the it's burn these now and the mood is right for socialism\nUm but then I remember that he's actually a far left progressive in and we'll say a lot of things that are very

gonna be twenty twenty either it's just not it's not there anymore that that that Bernie magic such as it was it's not their out but this is an ignorant position the one that he takes you about that somehow Trump is the one who shoot trumpet show cozy with Saudi Arabia he's got all these business interest there I asked a a\nAn ethics he got as part of some NGO that does ethics or whatever I forget what it's what is even called I said so what what exactly is\nTrump's supposed to do here so that he doesn't get told all the time that he has business interests that are being affected by something\nUh I I get so bored with this oh Trump owns this hotel or that hotel and people are going there and spending money there's they're gonna buy him oh okay so I can now go to a hotel think about this the way that they talk about Trump and Saudis in these business deals or or rather just his hotel and how their salaries that will stay there and do you see\nA ... by liberal logic on this matter I could go stay at a Hilton Hotels somewhere\nAnd and think that I'm having influence on the thinking or or the or really that that I've bought off Conrad Hilton or wherever the air to the hilt in are the guys I think it's Conrad Hilton but that's liberal thinking now\nThat's right the Saudis by by spending some money at a hotel the Trump owns a part of a they now have too much sway over his over his foreign policy I mean that's\nThat's pretty ridiculous but it's the way that they want to take this now is you can't be a business\nOwner you can't be somebody who's in the private sector and be a president you have to be lifelong bureaucrat I think that I think the Democrats would prefer that\nBut the Saudi issue is just been turned into a ... issue and it's going to continue to be that

a problem with it and they would take it and try to twist it and use it as a weapon against me and it's just not\nWorth the risk\nAnd it's really hard to do any kind of comedy is really hard to ... because comedy entails risks right you're you're you're trying to push boundaries you're trying to I'm I'm not a comedian but I Do some funny stuff here and there\nAnd I certainly wish I could do even more amusing uh takes on commentary on politics than I Do but it's I just know that you know you you run up against this\nAh this third rail that's a mobile third rail either they it's not like it

to go out and vote for Democrats that's the best they can to\nYou know I I they're they're talking about health care a little bit and basically Trump is a racist and Trump is massage and this and all these other things you know they they also seem to forget that we haven't forgotten that\nBill Clinton hey ladies I haven't seen a little while is once you come over who wants to take a selfie with me\nSwatch words out of hand goes you know I just don't know it's got a mind of its own you know Bill Clinton's out there as somebody who is still very respecting Democrats articles in fact Hillary

say it's men can but it might not be Jamaican but you know a a puritan is somebody who lives with a constant fear that someone somewhere might be having a good time\nAnd you find that increasing the

men\nAlways it's just not a good way to go through life it's just not a a\nHealthy way to beat\nAnd increasingly I think for Democrats\nYou know it's a it's like a sugar high politically you know oh
