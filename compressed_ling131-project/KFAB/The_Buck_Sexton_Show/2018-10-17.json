another time\nAnd Joe ... when I say whose team is he on\nI Know the answer he's on Joe ... it's all it's all about Joe it's all about Scarborough himself he doesn't represent any ideology doesn't represent any set of principles he doesn't even represent being a journalist she's just they're just spout off\nAnd make sure he's Harris whooped up as high as possible you know come down with the swamp and the rock band Joe it's a little weird\nAnd you can tell they're trying to make this personal they're trying to they're trying to personally goad the president of the United states on this issue\nWhat is she really going to do folks\nWhat what message is he going to send the Saudis on this one that would show that would so dramatically changed their minds that would all of a sudden mean they would never do this again or they would think twice about doing this ... what are we really going to do this is not a U.S citizen this was knocked down on us soil\nThe Saudis let's break this down to what it is the Saudis kill the guy on\nDestroying with another country in a conflict is it disgusting and barbaric yes do the Saudis do disgusting ... all the time absolutely\nThat is nothing new why is\nThis our problem I keep hearing about how what what what is Trump going to do what is going to do\nWhat could he do and why is it on him\nShouldn't we don't we have a United Nations for exactly that purpose don't we have this international\nCommunity that I hear so much about all the time so there can be multilateral and concerted\nAction you saw a book but they won't do anything yeah exactly they won't do anything we're all day\nBut when they when they don't like what the US is doing it's oh why don't you wait for the international community it's it's better if it comes from from all nations United together oh what about this issue well no that's not wait for the United community of of nations that come together let let's have the u._s. do what\nI have to say ... the the frenzy the frenzy to the media is engaged in right now to make this the biggest story in the country and just skip\nOver what's\nGoing on with us troops for example in Afghanistan and place we're still at which we are still in the war\nUm we don't hear about it do we we don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or\nThey don't want to they they don't talk about that anymore or they want to focus on this issue and I would say it's not just because they do feel journalist ... special affinity for other journalists right that this hits home for them\nNot so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalists and listing on the OJ charging sheets on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists but you and that was Obama oh that's right you know tough guy Capra would say you know a damn ideas\nSaying that that you are really the best this administration is the best messenger on that issue yeah that's\nOoh tough talk tough talk to the Obama administration which used the Espionage Act more than every other business ration combined not a lot of talk about how they're destroying the first amendment though right not not much of that you hear that about Trump all the time because he\nTweets because he tweets it is\nThis journalist to show the what happened to them we still don't really know and we should not lose sight of that we don't know what happened to the show we have not been told what the facts\nAre of this case they're still trying to figure it out but everyone wants Trump to take action they they want to push the president I'd states the leader of the free world to do something that could upset the ballot\nIt's a power in the middle East that could have long term ramifications and they don't care about any of that what they really just want is the opportunity to criticize the president for inaction and then dump all over him for whatever action he takes\nThese people are disgusting or describes none other than\nChief national security propaganda is for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes takes this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump it's all Trump's fault somehow everything that the left doesn't like is Trump's fall play sixteen\nAnd met with President Trump is setting is that there's no consequences and what you have to realize is there's nobody else who can play the role of the United states the whole people like this to a guy\nAnd we are the world's oldest and most significant democracy and we're not we're not standing up for this there is not somebody else is going to do that and the consequences of that are\nJournalists everywhere are less safe\nAnd and let's face it we have a president of fitness center also they say so for a values like freedom of speech and dissent\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world and and\nThat's in line that I think it's getting much worse\nThat is a giant pile of crap a giant pile of crap from Obama's chief national security propagandist\nA guy who laughed about creating an echo chamber of idiot almost entirely Democrat journalists during the Obama years to sell the Iran deal lasted they're ignorance in their stupidity at least on that he was right\nThey do have a lot of idiot journalists at these media outlets especially the young ones were right out of college who have just bought into\nThis left this nonsense hook line and sinker but ... notice how far this goes in and this is trumped arrangement syndrome on the world stage\nAte a Saudi hit team kills a Saudi journalist in a consulate in Turkey and it's\nOn it's on Trump to make this right\nIt's on us to make this right let me tell you something as someone who has spent\nMore time than he ever thought he would in war zones alongside men and women who are wearing the uniform to defend this country and you essentially rebuild other people's countries for them I don't think we have to make everyone else's problems are problems all the time\nYou know Saudi Arabia is a terrible to radical kingdom\nThat we have to deal with because of the realities of the world we live in it's a terrible place by the way in large part because of the prevailing ideology which is fundamentalist Islam that's why it's so\nBad and repressive and intolerant that doesn't get talked about noticed that left out of the conversation entirely and the criticism here is much stronger against Trump himself then against is the leader of Saudi Arabia the de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman\n\n... someone somewhere gets killed by someone else and ditch Trump's fault you see he's the one that we should all be angry at\nThese people are delusional and what's worse given the length are willing to go to here to try and push for presidential action they're dangerous\nDon't forget that\nGot more on this and also obviously the Elizabeth Warren ... which is amusing and also insane\nUh and then just some issue as some of

and will hold them accountable they're not there are slowing down all they want to jump all over that their plan they want to jump all over the president and the vice president on this issue as much as they can\nAnd they're not waiting for anything they don't wanna wait for the fact that when the wait to see what action he takes day just\nPrefer this notion that yeah Trump is a bad guy that helps them sleep in one of the thing I Would disagree with vice president Pence on on one matter or the notion that this is an attack\nOn an independent press okay well he writes for the Washington Post but Saudi Arabia doesn't have an independent press at all not not even a little bit okay\nAre there is not an independent presence out here people say oh buckets been getting a little better than reads yeah whatever\n\nTurkey doesn't have an independent press in fact the country workers show was from what we see from what we believe murdered is one of the worst in the world when it comes to press freedom not Saudi Arabia turkey bad when it comes to press freedom\nSo when we say it's an attack on a free press yeah we live in a world where the free press is the exception not the rule lotta countries have all kinds of constraints on what can be printed what can be said what can be shared\nLots of countries\nAnd even countries that you think of as having a free press maybe some of the western European states for example they have\nRestrictions based on\nYou know hate crime legislation and all all kinds of stuff in Britain there's no oh you can ... you can print national security secrets because you're the press they had the official secrets act lock your but they don't care if it's a matter of public importance they'll just lock you up\nSo I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath and understand that yes this is bad yes the u._s. should send a strong message\nBut it's not the worst thing that's ever happened to the history of mankind we need just take a step back here and understand that people die all over the world under terrible circumstances everyday doesn't mean you ignore at all but it just means that you need perspective here and what we're going to do even if we find out that the Saudis\nAre as culpable as is as has been alleged from the very beginning meeting all the way up at the top\nMaybe will not sell them some munitions was ever going to sell them maybe we'll send them a a strong reprimand under we have no legal authority to do anything about this we are not signatories the United states is not a signatory to the international\nCriminal court so we can't go there and\nWe're not a signatory for good reason which is that the notion of an international criminal law doesn't really exist I mean yeah there's war crimes\nI guess but try enforcing those unless you've already beaten the country and brought them just admission that you want to punish people and because of their war crimes and it's just it's really easy to\nThe bank the tough guy drum on this issue it's it's a lot harder to sit back and actually come up with constructive ways to deal with all this\nYou know it's really easy to say oh you know I'm I'm all about a free press and Trump isn't doing enough or what should we do I'm not just saying oh we can't bring to show the back because we can't but he's not he's not an American why does it fall on us\nWhy does it fall on us just wonder you know wondering why that is\nAnd I think it's because they see they view this ultimately this is just another opportunity to bash the president that's that's what really gets them motivated as some get some really excited about all this um I I wore a Jew or talk to you a bit about\nWhat's going on comes to immigration right now in this country we have another caravan

S.\nUm the u._s. project a US government projects with the Pentagon involved\nOr they won't do that anymore they they refuse so Google has a has a moral issue with working with the United states government in the Pentagon even for technology that just as a political to that as a Google said oh no we can't do that we're going to step away from that\nMeanwhile\nThis is ... this was in the Washington Post earlier today quote Google finally confirmed a secretive\nProject that's been fueling employee led backlash for weeks at the company an effort to build a version of its search engine that complies with China's online censorship regime\nThe project code named dragging fly is not only real but it's already performing to the satisfaction of top Google executives and it could pave the way for Google to re enter ... uh China's online search market after nearly a decade\nIf Google were to operate and try and what would it look like what ... will we be able to serve chief executive some dark pitch I said during an event hosted by wired on Monday Night it turns out will be able to serve well over Ninety nine percent of the queries\nAnnouncement could prompt more questions from us policymakers some of whom have accused Google of being invasive about project drag and fly\nMeanwhile Google and its peers in the tech industry are facing intense scrutiny over its approach to user privacy and data with some lawmakers talking to the bottom ... okay well there's that but the bigger backlash as far as I'm concerned has to do with Google and is this Pentagon project\nAnd why they won't they don't feel any any obligation\nWhatsoever as a U.S company\nUh to keep working on this out of out of patriotism um here's here's this New York times piece back in\nA back in early June of this year quote Google hoping to head off or rebellion my employees upset that the technology they're working on call it could be used for purposes will not renew his contract with the Pentagon for artificial intelligence work when the current deal expires next year\nThis is a perfect example of the diluted pie in the sky liberalism that defines the modern left today you know the the super

have I mean\nUh in terms of their of the ideas we can't just oppose them when we got to crush the ideas I don't crush people but I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as the kids say we might have to own the lives a little bit uh so Lindsey Graham I liked\nThat he's been oh is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also think that you know all on immigration and he has some interesting things to say I I I got to get him I got to get them a little more a hard line on this stuff ... here's what he said play click bait\nThey're eleven million illegal immigrants here that came from burning a poor country\nWhat do we do with them I Want a merit based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans working together build a wall control who gets the job\nMore legal immigration moved to ... based immigration you can ignore the eleven may and they'll never be a deal right with the Democratic party that does make a deal with the eleven may in her non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know I I don't think he gets it on this one you have folks I think that Lindsey\nIs a little is a little too squishy on the issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University math nerds for backing me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least\nI I don't know what we have to do to get people to understand this is not a lemon is twenty million at a minimum which is a vast number of people\nFrom a a generally speaking from one country from Mexico I mean that the vast majority of them are from Mexico\nWhich also happens to be a neighbor of ours geographically where there was an enormous border\nAnd you know it it poses its own issues for political unity in this country really does I Know people are not allowed to national security analyst will tell you that when you have a population that has\nA that has moved across the border that has fought wars over that Porter we don't often think about that but we fought a war with Mexico over the border\nAnd then you have a population that maintains a tremendous and continue tremendously powerful and continuing tied to the the what's considered the homeland of the mother country\nA ... you have a recipe for stabilization you really do I mean politically at a minimum destabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is a you know he needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham is might look I give you a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as\nI'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're going to get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be amnesty in Memphis\nSee what happens for your security we'll see what happens with this request for a wall\nAnd that's not good enough that's not acceptable\nTo eat unless he talked a little bit more about this deal that he thinks is going to happen play seven\nHouses have been and a half for the wall I mean excuse me five and the Senate has to be an ad\nWill close the gap a duck I remember that six hundred and Ninety thousand kids brought here on the average age of six no place else to go Trump's going to win in court he can repeal dock of the day he wins in court what do we do with these young people so I'd like to do a deal for wall funding for ...\nFor funding for DACA that that I think I think\nYou could sell that to the republic ... if it was full well funny you get that five billion\nAnd it's just deferred action still are it's not a\nA but it you know it can't be it can be citizenship and can't be permanent just okay well we're going to have a we're going to see how this goes it because you can't discuss what you're going to do with the out of Lebanon but twenty million illegals in this country and Jill you have\nA reasonable assurance that you're not going to be dealing with another twenty million in ten years and if you by the way I understand that the\nPolitical sway that the Latino Democrat community in this country will have for even more a unrestricted immigration particularly from your from South of the border that will skew the entire debate and discussion going forward\nAnd all Democrats will see is that they will be importing masses of new voters\nWho will essentially make the Republican Party a you know a an afterthought they will they will be able to turn America into a one party state\nThat's the game the Democrats are flying the

[laughter]\nActually wasn't al ... and like Ireland down [laughter]\nAnd you know you know she came home and cry planned well wow this is a it specifically\nLiberal problem and and I I don't ever like to be mean or even to silly lips and I don't like to mock anyone's family and I certainly\nWould never mock a twelve year old girl or twelve year old boy twelve year old anybody\nUm that's not cool that's not nice it's not fair and it's a on becoming\nSo I'm not commenting on a twelve year old as somebody with strong opinions and who goes home from school and cries about them that's that's not of any interest to me whatsoever what is of interest to me is that that was a clip\nOf Maggie June ... the actress on the view and she seems to think that it is not just normal but expected for a twelve year old to be quote an act of asked\nKid should be allowed to be kids and the only way that a a normal child\nWould feel the need to come home and cry because that young girl met another girl who did not self described as a feminist is because of the parents are engaging in a really relentless\nPropaganda campaign toward their own children\nNow parents can raise kids with whatever believes they want but I I Would just note that I think that they're doing a disservice I think that anyone does a disservice\nTo a very young person by ... really instilling in um a radical leftist belief and not letting them keep an open minded and develop their own beliefs but I also think that increasingly parents these days and just adults in general in America\nWho our lives who are liberals have\nAbsolutely no perspective on these issues that they have no ability to stand back and try to be a little objective their purpose other kids and you know letting their kids come to their own beliefs and not feel familial pressure to take certain positions because even as an adult\nYou should always be testing and retesting your assumption I mean if you're someone who's going to be politically active it's essential to think\nHow I changed my mind what what evidence could be shown that would lead me to change my mind\nWhy do I not agree with the other side is there anything that could change that would make me agree with the other side and my shore I'm right about what I think and believe on every issue should constantly be doing that\nI think it's necessary for the intellectual\nLife of the mind I Would I I think it's it's a a really a precondition for being a true in full conservative honestly you have to always say why do I think these things why do I think that the way that it has been or the way that I have thought it has been is the best way what am I trying to conserve\nLives on the other hand love to do this thing of you know my eight year old with like asking me about like why is it that intersection of politics have not been adopted by the mainstream media complex in quite the way that I Would expect\nAnd they do this lots of lived journalist do this\nAnd we know that that's not true but they do seem to think that there is a kind of moral blackmail\nInherent in putting children into political debates which is why they became so fond of using the Parkland kids for political purposes right that's why there were some very politically active Parkland teenagers who are all of a sudden being sent not just to make a case but on search and destroy missions\nIn terms of politics against conservatives that was what they were trying to do\nA that was what their their mission was and the whole point was that they were victims and therefore could not be truly challenged on any of these issues so you know this is this is a very real tendency on the left to politicize children and then use children as political pawns in a way that I think it's just really gross\nAnd it's just funny that they can say ... like my twelve year old is like an activist and like how can anyone else not be a feminist your daughter's twelve Maggie\nRight or be it for me to tell you what to do as a parent because I'm not even a parent but I Do know something about politics but you got to be a kid what a wait a little bit before she has really deeply ingrained believes that come directly from mommy about politics I think that would be a more intellectually fair play\nStar roll call is next\nNews radio eleven [noise]\n\nWith all the recent news
