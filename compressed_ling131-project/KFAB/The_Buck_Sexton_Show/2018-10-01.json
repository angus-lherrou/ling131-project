that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named three potential people would be the Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh and isn't it

Supreme Court justice\nAnd they replaced Ginsburg faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney\nShe writes except in life and now they're trying to destroy them and I can tell you one thing I like that don't raped women there's no way it does happen finding a case in America where a guy was number one in class\nAnd it was really educated on what the sport started a great kid has tons of women friends and tons of childhood friends or stand up for him and the well regarded judge and suddenly you find out he was a rapist or attempted rape historic gang rape is it's the stupidest thing ever heard\nI grew up with nothing but Catholic school boys and let me tell you we all like women but we're all nice guys were like the date when we don't like to write women [laughter] I've never heard anything so outrageous and so stupid and my entire life show me a witness okay no problem there are none nobody saw it happen it didn't happen\nWell and and the name she provided indicate that she's not telling the truth the problem here is Brett Kavanaugh as the man he's a he's a he's a he's a father whose husband is female friends is too cute little daughters\nThere is no credible evidence whatsoever you did any of these things and there is no truth there's no fairness and there's no evidence there's no facts but Fox News there's declared at all credible how is it possible that record a judge no pilot China or Chris Wallace or car rub good say boy that's credible credible\nWhat the hell is then if credible I Want to hear incredible\nCredible because they didn't break or because no one tried to break or no one at the single question I mean here's the deal if if I was a criminal awaiting trial I Would be for that woman\nTo help you get out of a ditch\nI

I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I tend to look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and uh after a doctor forwarded testified\nThe the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely wrong extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listen or delivery delivery of those words and talk about these sold and the impact it in our life and not have your heart go out to her this is a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ... generally I respect said I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist said forward as a credible unbelievable\nSo one when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and they're still and there's the Democrats show toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely but but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have Andrew Nepal autonomy and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provide as witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all what when you have ah Christine forward straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere that every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering\nAnd the woman who won the anonymity to testify turn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out her lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all so every time I Try to test her credibility making bars it turns out to be great grossly lacking\nSo one conservative commentators say she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't and we completely lost our way\n[laughter] right I think Rick ... Karl Rove yes [noise] you know completely lost our way because he was the one time I sat down Trump never had a chance of winning\nOr the people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to after the testimony nothing could it's women and men I found Brett Kavanaugh to people even though there was such a raw emotion from a falsely accused innocent man who end up in the court of public opinion and the current day cleaning up\nTo this quote unquote hearing his life was completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats and his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nI she obviously has been in therapy for H.\nI. she had set herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to front door bell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had issues now it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or just because she says Brett Kavanaugh rape or maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far all start feeding additives\nIn fact if you present it as sort of court of law in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith Leyland Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in Kaiser\nWho would have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did not get discount marks judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen what the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court when his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Wallace Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because\n... ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof it was my responsibility or order\nA present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to beat the post let me tell you something I wasn't given wires from the defensive side that treated me what's kept glove no okay it was a very uncomfortable or hearing solved it talks about equal right on gender equality what do you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that isn't mad at eight percent and bringing bringing forward charges against another person so I don't watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes in the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly than we find out she was all over the world\nI and also just the whole story said thank thank God for people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh and thank God for Lindsey Graham because\nBecause Brett without Brett cabinet or Lindsey Graham's defense there was no other Republican up there\nWill know than Brett Kavanaugh yeah in fact judge you know Jeff Flake hiding out in an elevator as you get to\nThe crews type of salt ah from some screaming woman who says look me in the ... I would've said lady\nI'm On your side I'm not in favor of sexual assault or trying to find out the truth you know I mean do you believe every woman who says she was sexually assaulted and that's the case the ... the Duke lacrosse team would all be locked up and they use UVA Rolling Stone story never would have happened\nAbout ten to twenty percent of these stories are dishes eighty Ninety percent of legitimate\nWhich is you know nobody's going to have a car stolen and tell the police as a Chevy one it really it's a Ford so but but in the area of sexual assault\nThings of that character tend to twenty percent of the time\nThere's false memory or false information given very motive and in this case some Thirty years went by into twenty twenty twenty twelve when she was in a conference or their husband rose will be goes in marriage difficult is because she wanted to front doors Thirty years later\nAnd that's the first time the therapists took notes and the therapist notes her own therapist do not confirm her story according to the Washington Post then she would not give her therapist knows under HIPAA rules to the United States Senate but you gave it to the Washington Post and\nThe nose to the therapist and not contained in a bread cabinet and they had different numbers of individuals is holding her\nSo the therapist notes the not confirming story in fact in obstructed or story but they send it seemed to ignore that too\n[noise] why it seems like everybody on a laptop and wants to ignore all the holes and you cannot like you said that's what I Want to withstand a court of law and any jury that would look at the testimony would not find the evidence\nYou know I heard a lot of the founding is the missile interests I call them on the left I say that survivors must be believe or well when we believe that they have been assaulted but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Omaha", "day": "01"}
