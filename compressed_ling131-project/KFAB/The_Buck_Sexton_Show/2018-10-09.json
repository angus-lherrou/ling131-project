one side\nBut demanding veal obliteration of the other\nDemanding the arrest of political opponents demanded the harassment of people trying to serve their country people who have served honorably in

any kind of\nHonest forthright and decent discourse in this country because anyone who was an effective spokesperson for the other side of anybody who\nWas able to wield power and authority on the right and stand up to the progressive project would have been a target for the most vicious smears and character assassination\nAnd there would have been this sense that once the allegation is out

left right the aid the part of the mind that is where instinctive impulses lie\nThe end of the progressive left has become violent and dangerous an unreasonable and perpetually outraged it's just not

need to tear their system down because Kavanaugh was on the Supreme\nCourt we no longer can accept what their system produces for politics they start to sound less and less like the voice of opposition and more and more like the voice of anarchists people that\nRefused to accept any position\nThat is an opposition to their closely held beliefs and if they have to engineer it they will not look to win back power so much to destroy the system of power in our government and she's it for themselves not with the consent of the people but\nIn the name of the very people who have repudiated

than Thad ... is that what she told us and that she was sent that um we have a presumption of innocence and that's kind of trade and when I looked at the lack of any corroborating evidence including\nNo evidence from her very best friend who was present at\nParty I could not concluded that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant\nJust trying to have it always and you can't say somebody as credible and then completely question their story she struck a nerve to me and what she said and how she voted because that's political cowardice um that is somebody who is pretending to be a feminist but that is fake feminist on\nFake feminism a former Hillary Clinton hack their Psaki said wait is that is she Hillary Clinton or no no I'm Sorry she's a former Obama administration spokesperson for the state department thought she was I'm sure she's run this wasn't too but notice how quickly they will just attack\nAttack women who do not go along with the left wing feminist agenda right away they'll attack viciously too because when a woman does not go along and really undermined the power structure\nIt's like within the Islamic faith with the radicals if you were an apostate if you had been within the faith and left the hatred that much more because you are more of a danger because the faithful will see or departure and think\nWhy did that person do same is true with radical leftist feminine they see a woman who breaks ranks with them and their response is oh maybe maybe we need well they say we need to destroy his person right away because other women will say hold on a second maybe I can think for myself to\nMaybe there's something else here\nOn and there were there were some people who came through not just Lindsey Graham who I've given lots of props you already on the show there were others\nI gave Jeff Flake a very hard time I think that he gambled with the Kavanaugh nomination or by delaying it a week some would say though had he not do\nIt it would not have had the votes I don't know if that's true or not but it's certainly seemed like a a cowardly move at the time to me\nThat said when push came to shove flake did the right thing here at\nThe moment he had to do it so I'm not saying you know he he's not Spartacus either but he deserves credit mansion in West Virginia also deserves some credit but let's also keep it real\nWest Virginia is a state where the sentiment was overwhelmingly\nIn favor of Kavanaugh and against this obvious political hit\nCollins from Maine yes I think she did the right thing here I also think that all the radical\nLeftist feminist types calling her terrible names and sending her hateful messages for weeks and weeks trying to intimidate her to threaten her into going along with the leftist feminist agenda I think that didn't help their case\nAnd then that brings me to Murkowski now\nI don't know about wait wait before getting Murkowski Hi Ken I Hope I Hope that people in her home state deal a deal her quite a review for what she's already down five points\nUh but I I really do hope that they manage to find a way to hold her accountable for what was an unbelievably lame decision um\nYou know North Dakota in ... should oust high camp at the ... possible moment\nAnd then that leaves us with Murkowski All right now Murkowski is not somebody who's ever been impressive to me at all and I'm not surprised that she she pulled distant and she's not up until twenty twenty or twenty twenty ... twenty twenty two\nUm she's not up for quite a while so her calculation is clearly she can massage this issue later on you know take some heat now and then and then she'll figure it out or take less see now really Mitchell figure it out later I Hope the American\nPeople are accountable um I Hope that the people of Alaska\nK. E. N. I. up in the house you're listening to the show alive I Know you guys up there in Anchorage give you a high five\nI Hope that you do everything you can to mobilize and make sure that she is at the soon as possible moment no longer\nIn the United States Senate for what she did here it's not just about the ... for for me to the notion of having a conservative on on the Supreme Court that's important sure I'm not going to pretend like I'm not also invested in the politics here of course I Am\nBut what was at stake here was so much more than that it was whether we would reward the worst political instincts in this country\nOr take a stand for decency and every single Democrat who voted against Kavanaugh took a stand for the worst possible political impulses\nAnd every Republican who voted for Kavanaugh did the opposite did the right thing um and I think we should be proud of and look Mitch McConnell he gets crashed a lot on TALK radio has for a long time people say he's a rhino people say he's he's too establishment and you know maybe that's true\nBut you know not all that ... and this fight that Mitch McConnell has been the general for he really has\nOur rumors McCall rude on ... you know Mitch McConnell has been directing this one and done a very good job of one blocking the seat that would have gone to Merrick Garland who you know but they say he's a centrist you would have gone with the left on eighty percent of things I mean he would have been\nHe would have been just as as reliable as a lot of the other left these they have on the court\nSo that's one party and he would have been right there with Kagan um and not not as far so to my door but you know the Huffington Post comments section isn't as far left to sort of my or\nA but the fact that Mitch McConnell managed to get all the get Kavanaugh through he said he would and he did you got to give me some credit you gotta take your moment to moment to tip a hat to Mitch McConnell here but I Want to return to this notion of the of the cycle left for a moment\nAnd how they have had this collective nervous breakdown I I Want to get into this with you they went after somebody recently and it's I think unfortunately a harbinger of things to come we'll get into that stay with me news\nUm but you know his wife read about how she gets threats her church child or children get a get threats\nAnd prominent Democrats make jokes out there in the media or in the Democratic party make jokes about the attack on Rand Paul as though it somehow funny this is something cute that they should laugh about similar disgusting\nI keep saying they should be ashamed but they they have no honor and so they don't feel anything when their honor is lost it can't be ... based because there's nothing there to begin with that's one of the problems when you're fighting against the left is that they don't they don't feel the loss of honor because they have nothing to begin with\nBut you know Brian kill me is a guy that I I don't I don't know Brian I work in the before I I Know everybody in conservative media at least by reputation if not knowing them through work Muslim or personally I Know everybody by reputation\nAnd Brian is universally considered a by everyone I've ever spoken to a really\nNice decent guy you know whether you like his uh his\nOwner persona or his analysis you that's that's a relative\nHe's a nice guys is supposed to be a really good I don't know modeling work them or the other people I could tell your good guy Brian I can only say you know I've heard is really nice guy and I've always been ... enjoyment or actually even if he was let's just say he was in Olbermann level jackass but she's not let's just say he was\nHe would not deserve what happened to him over the weekend where he was Stockton harassed by a couple a left wing 'cause you know are there any other kind these days activists comedians here some of the audio from it play eight\nRight what's your accuses sexually harassing\nYesterday not everyone I Know\nNot on the news on this front lines are drawn to confront Wright kill me if you don't want Donald Trump day [noise]\nOr do felt this guy he's the only person in America that Donald Trump Clinton [noise]\nTrying to get a criminal creator no\nDoubt\n\nThat goes from and you think about what you're doing it\nNow I don't know those idiots are and I can tell you when I say this and I say this knowing full well some point I might have to come on air and explain to you that you know I got into\nA a a scuffle and a lot of these media types you know they\nThey think that they're a you know impervious to this kind of thing to think that there's not something to worry about but I Would not deal well with some or left wing hack following me into the subway look is one thing to wait outside somebody's home and do the ambush interview thing I think that's pretty tasteless I don't like it when conservatives do it either\nI think it's pretty tasteless unless there's a real news reason to do it right unless somebody's refusing to answer questions about something that's really newsworthy it's different in the halls of the Senate it's different in a public space a public building with somebody who's a public official\nThat does you know there's a difference in waiting for ... waiting for whether it's Mitch McConnell or you know Dianne Feinstein\nIn the whole the Senate building to ask a question versus waiting outside their home that's weird there are boundaries year but this goes even beyond that\nBecause not only was there the the ambush interview component of this then there was the following him into the subway so that's really ... now you're not just going up to somebody and they walk past you you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done this is following them down in the subway getting in the same subway car\nPublicly trying to humiliate him\nAnd then trying to kind of whip up an angry mob against him in the subway car\nWhat if somebody in the subway car you know who heard that Brian kilometers racist what if that person down and Brian space\nI Want to pry and you know felt threatened what if you shut that person what if a Fighting Sioux what if somebody got really hurt that's not a hard thing to create as a possibility here in your mind because they have these these these more on one of the comedians\nAre creating a combustible situation they're creating a scenario in which would not be difficult for there'll be an escalation of physical violence\nAnd you have to think that when they do this time and again when they create these kinds of situations that so clearly could turn into a violent confrontation\nAnd they don't mind that they're running that rescue sort of thing but maybe that's really what they're pushing for this is who the left has become\nThey won't deny it they won't shut this down they won't cold out there are increasingly embracing not just the politics of public nervous breakdowns and acting like psychosis who were\nSlamming on the on the thirteenth on doors of\nThe Supreme Court but also they are the less in the Democratic party are

New Jersey now or by the way a senator Hirono\nWho I think is is the dumbest woman in the Senate and that's that's quite a that's quite a title behold she may be the dumbest person in the Senate um I you know I I don't know I it's very possible she can be the single\nDumbest US Senator right now based on what I've seen of her in the last month or so\nBut you know here's her position on whether

there was wrong\nIt's it's hard to have such a a long winded ramble and not accidentally say something that's correct but she managed senator Rona managed\nBecause she's the dumbest person in the Senate everything that you said there was incorrect\nOr this notion that Kavanaugh showed partisanship let's I Would never lose sight of what happened and what the Democrats did hear and what a bunch of got her creatures the Democrats are and how low and unseemly and just disgusting they are\nAbsolutely abhorrent I mean they are rotten\nThey put Kavanaugh in a position\nWhere they not only were accusing him of the flimsy is kinds of of uh in terms of evidence Lindsey is allegations you could come up with you know don't know when I don't know where I don't know who don't know at all I Know that one person did\nFlimsy just allegations you could really conjure on top of it they ran with a crazy person allegations of ... of capital is in a gang rape bring that she herself refuted in an on air interview\nShe didn't mean to refute them but she's obviously not well and not very bright and just destroyed her own story on TV\nAnd and he ... he responded to this clearly coordinated part is an assault by just calling it for what it was and now that is part is it well you know this reminds me the last does this ... this is a tactic that Obama got away with all the time Obama would say\nThere are some people on the left or service or sorry not on the left his some conservative soldier or cramming this um you know there's been part is they're just being partisan\nAnd you'd say well hold on a second when Obama says they're just being partisan is that his version of they're not doing what I Want them to do an I'm pushing a very partisan agenda but I'm not being partisan they're being part is\nThere is a lack of understanding or at least the lack of honesty about what's really happening when you're having that kind of a political conversation the only people who are partisans are those who won't go along with your part is an agenda but this is the this is the delusion that left ... look ... left ism is\nPeople have lost it I mean this is really we're getting into crazy town territory here\nAre the Democrat Party they don't have a lot left you know that they were you look at what they're pushing for you got a little bit of Marxism here and there are a little more government bureaucrats and employees you're there you know social policies that are incoherent and self refuting now you know the thirty seven genders and all this stuff it's just\nBut they really think it's going to be Warren and\nYou know here's somebody who is entirely unremarkable in her career weren't not for racial fraud racial fraud you know if you will lie about the assets you have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison and if you lie about that\nYou get it a whole lot of trouble if you lie about\nYour race in order to get into a university or in this case to get a professorship at a at the most prestigious universities\nReally at Harvard Democrats as long as you told the line for them or are willing to use the whole thing I mean it it should it's in it's embarrassing and as a mental lives with Warren has here's what's important about it to me well there's a lot of things but here's what I won't let go she has never owned up to this\nShe has never said if she came out and said you know what I disagree with our racial spoil system\nI did this knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this is ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough but technically I caught technically a qualified no\nInstead she pulled this whole high cheekbones thing and then we're supposed to pretend\nThat somebody went to law school at Rutgers I'm not putting Rutgers down but you don't go to law school at Rutgers may become a professor at Harvard law you just don't unless you have a special angle I didn't let you have something to help you through and she's never been forced to own up to this\nAnd the fact that the ... I mean this is just like the NFL kneeling thing\nYou know Trump is incredible at picking means areas he he it really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things\nThat the last just get so fired up an energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winter for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL nearing for example the left thought oh and these different players who obviously or kneeling ah but the media narrative around this was over the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling\nAnd Trump kept poking at this ... you guys better Stan show because\nTrump understands that the end of the day a vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown some slack Moore show them that love football people want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that he understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as\nPocahontas he knows that the laughter is going to drop and oh my gosh she's being a racist why Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which was by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there\nUh I was very

they're making for kids these days\nHe knows when he calls Warren Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised the jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just normal people who are not emotionally destabilize left is where we\nHere is why are they why are they defending\nElizabeth Warren being called the ... you know she's not a Native American right we all understand so why do they act like this is some big slide against Native Americans appointed she's ... she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Polk honest is probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm sure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nAbout the record nation and how it was a matriarchal society and how they were the basis for our U.S Constitution and\nWho've there's some really interesting were vision is out there about\nA native peoples in America and how bad technologically and politically advance their societies where or when you have not mastered the wheel or writing\nEighties to claim I think that the European columnists we're taking much of their political system or you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the Warren thing are we calling her Pocahontas and you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on the show\nThe less deserves to be mocked what has to be ridiculed if they are taken seriously they ... when they're being an serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snap them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked in ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on the in these positions on these areas because satire is a very powerful tool it's very powerful\nA there's a reason

I got it like this special level tournaments in fever I was playing kids in\nAll the from Shanghai to Korea to Rio de Janeiro and uh I was I was pretty nasty it the fee for anyway I was like ten years ago\nSo Columbus Day people get all upset about because of the Columbus owned slaves and was a pill a jerk\nAnd to that I just point out or why is it that we only judge and I know others are making this point you but I really I really do look at this 'cause that period of\nIn the history of the fifteenth sixteenth\nCentury is a particular interest to me you had a massive Muslim slave trade going on in the America so put that aside for a moment you had a huge slave trade in the Islamic world of white Christians I Would know they were being created a slaves all over the place a lot of them a labor to guess work to death\nOr the women were putting ... you could figure out what that was all about\nA that was going on millions of people over the course of a few centuries and\nSo it's not like it was just the slave trade in in Western Europe although we're always led to believe that\nBut then you get into the Americas and you read a little bit about particularly the a Caribbean tribes or in you know native tribes and the Aztec an anchor people's as well as all the tributary\nGroups below them and the Aztec Empire for example was a massive empire built on slavery human sacrifice and yes there was a lot of\nThey were eating people\nAnd when they weren't eating them they were ripping they're beating hearts out of their chest because they thought that that's what their God wanted so I Do think that there was a little bit of a need to you know a move up the the ethical civilization scale quite a bit\nSo why don't we look on that at the same time period with any horror no we'll look on on Columbus and\nAnd apply the moral standards of today to back then well if we're going to apply the standards of today here's the point that you won't hear the left me\nColumbus was morally much more advanced than these civilizations he came into contact with in the new world and a dare I say in comparison to what he came across\nWas much more ethical and I know that's ooh that's so controversial but it's also true even though they were bad\nOn both sides ...\n...
