F. A. B.\nAnd what's going to happen with it and I got a housing development\nOh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh\nIt was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious later and it was a dinner they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama paid one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion and uh we got him\nBack and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure as very happy right now\nAbout your wife is good she's a lawyer to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well\nShe's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh\nAnd the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you are going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and its works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end we weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs you're talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products are there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff to make a big deal of if they have three hundred actually\nThree hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent of the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least is fair and are\nFarmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's sort of ... percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it so we charge them virtually nothing and they said\nMillions and millions of cars if we want to send a\nA piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start taxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we are not call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and and he said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the we'd\nBe able to find a way of five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've built Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airports we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President and she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been no effect not what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because at twenty five percent so we're taking in billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists\nThey're going to start building these plants here to make the product here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we\nUsed to do it so China has been look China is the biggest several mall by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade will is with
