stuck it out before they even made it to the border [noise] um\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country if white men most of them radicalized ...

that\nThat's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor\nSays we need to stop demonizing people Hama and understand that white men on the right or the real threat they're the real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling\nI didn't make him saying I'm not taking his words out of context I'm just playing for you what he said on national TV\nAnd you can say about why there's so much for a while either you're focusing on those and come up no no no she is representative of the overall mindset on the left that's why we did the montage this is this is what these people this is what the other side the left the Democrats what they think\nThey really believe that they're not the problem at all when it comes to nasty\nOverheated dangerous rhetoric the other side is the problem dot dot dot because the other side's a bunch of evil racist Nazi biggest Dina fold you know ... ... vehicles with blood on their hands\nOh I see that\nThat is at the heart of why we're having such a a descent into political madness in this country they don't even have the self awareness\nThat don't even have the ... the the the honesty to be able to understand that you are not going to improve the temperature\nOf political rhetoric if in fact your go to position is that the political rhetoric is bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the right to stack fires the Nazis and ever did you hear that opening montage\n\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know that you know what it really drives a lot of this\nIs a success or the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before it\nOr that they told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement\nThey told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing and that we would all essentially they would be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences\nOf having Donald Trump as president but you see we have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president\nAnd it's suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming economy a ton of investment\nNo massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military intervention that are going to stand our bravest and best Americans in\nThe harms way for a mission that the powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end and what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's those are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've\nFelt that for two years now that we've seen it for ourselves there is a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of some of the most celebrated\nNames in the Democratic party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong\nAll they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude is tone\nA but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from other lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base\nOr failed miserably no quite the opposite they they hate Trump more because he is successful\nThey hate Trump more because she is by his ability to withstand them and succeed despite all of their efforts\nHe's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together\nIn such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are if they do not have their progressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are if they can't believe that\nCNN is objective and the New York times is a liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people vote\nDemocrat it rattles them in a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a in a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up right we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we try to take a rational approach to it and and even if someone just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case\nI Do like it when Trump owns lives I find it very amusing I think it's very necessary to I think the media in this country will never be the same and that's a good thing I think the days of believing that there is an objective neutral press that as the the center of our our media apparatus that's never coming back that's gone\nNow we now we expect honesty and trends parents do or else there will be at least push back there will be a fight over it\nBut the calls for civility from Democrats for the last couple of weeks as I've been saying all along\nHas been in bad faith what they want is for conservatives that for Trump and for the right to engage in self doubts and just stop fighting and there will\nBe no reward there'll be no meeting in the middle window right decides to stop pushing for its beliefs and what it thinks is correct and what is best for the country all you will have is the left exploit the situation for their own ends and then go back to what we saw\nFor the eight years of the Obama administration which was rub your enemies faces in it at every opportunity\nRight to their left under Obama took the attitude of no prisoners politically speaking they didn't just you know overrun conservatism for at least the first few years of Obama's time in office they overran the conservative outpost a number ... ...\nIt was rough there was no good faith there was no meeting in the middle there was no bipartisanship no triangulation nothing\nNow were you believe that we should win it looks like there's so much more on the horizon that would be good for the country and the Trump could accomplish now we're supposed to listen to the opposition somewhat say our political enemies and take their advice for how we fight when we're winning I don't think so\nI don't think so\nAid for for

Star Wars again so I get a mix all of a right\nWe didn't make some of it and I think that's that's the great things that people don't necessarily always know about this is the orchestra is it's an incredibly versatile organism there's sometimes we have the orchestra doing for different programs in a week and we'll be tainted occasion program where our primary audience is early elementary school kids\nIn the same week doing a program working with our Hispanic community to celebrate Hispanic heritage month at the same time rehearsing for the opera which is the next week and doing a symphony rocks show all in the same seven days and that I think this is the gift\nThat can bring to the numbers are quite staggering actually so when you think about the um Hudson's bay and the fact that he says over a hundred and twenty thousand people every year and of course a number of those folks are in our culture but I Would say over thirty percent or not\nAnd we've got twenty five thousand other areas students to participate in education programs all the way from a mission imagination program is the first\nIntroduction to our pre school and early elementary kids to a partnership with hall in New York um which allows kids to study music with recorders remember recruiters yeah fluke\nI Love Lincoln because the teachers implement the curriculum in their classroom such a big responsibility for them but then the culminating event as the kids come to the concert home with their record\nAnd they all play with the same level and kept the great program right into the high school programs where we're able to partner with some of our other organizations like the job when I Am not really for the kids to do hands on workshop in many different forms the first half of the day and sending

for taking my call like you're going to get on the subject of this or birthright deal and if people are informed of the fourteen conch constitutional amendment it has nothing to do with illegal yep\nOh I'm In that in death coming up later on the show but just I guess that's kind of a kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that that is the case that illegal aliens\nNo court has held illegal aliens or should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before and when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nTo consider people who are foreign citizens meaning citizen of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic or their children born here should be automatic citizens and it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt it was formed to give the birthright to the children of slaves\nWas aboard the fourteenth amendment was what was for it was for yet that the descendants of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all no this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal east here about the different jurisdictions and overlapping jurisdictions but it should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's\nWing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie is with the Democrats don't really understand is that no matter what once again they are showing their chipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country oh yeah they always take the side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face and yeah he has every right to do that\nYeah I think he's I think he's making the I think he's making them the right move on that so thank you very much for calling calling from Maryland ... even in Springfield, Massachusetts what's up Stephen\n... Mr buckled the wisest one I I really enjoy your show your your your discussions are extremely thoughts on I really appreciate that you're very kind\nOn the other thing that they don't want to mention it and believe it or at the scene of ties in with John Lennon the dog ... has their own then on the towards white men Israelis they're down towards losing working class voters on and especially with the Trump presidency they've lost a lot of union ... or\n... says their animals towards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on the ... thing I was wondering and wondering is all that this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare all day because there's a crisis of a caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what what do you think any idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out because one of my pet peeves store long long time is that people don't understand that a white in his country means your\nYour ability and freedom to do something it it's All right the pound and a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that technically\nNew immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on welfare in fact in immigration law there's a there's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of\nThe states are so you cannot be a dependent on the state and that they know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system\nIs set up as we know that's not the case what ends up happening is for example with the anchor ah the anchor baby issue once you have it as a child who is a is it given citizenship either to a to a legal parents then\nAccrue to that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a a two year old you don't give a newborn\nIf you're interested in volunteering register online at registering dot org that's registered to ring dot org the salvation army doing the most good right here in Omaha and now look back at this week\nIn history this week an Eighteen Ninety to the adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is published\nThe book was the first collection of home stories which Conan Doyle has been publishing in magazines is Eighteen eighty seven he was born in Scotland and study medicine and the University of Edinburgh where he met Dr Joseph Bell\nA teacher with extraordinary conduct power bill partly inspired doors character Sherlock Holmes years later this week in Nineteen fifty Twenty one year old girl Lloyd becomes the first African American to play in an NBA game when he takes the court in the season opener for the Washington Capitals\nTwo other black players joined the NBA that season the Celtics drafted Chuck Cooper and the second round and the New York Knicks gotten that sweet what her Clifton from the Harlem Globetrotters but the Nixon Celtics\nDidn't start their seasons until a few days later\nThis week in Nineteen fifty seven the Japanese car company Toyota establishes a U.S headquarters in\nAn old ramblers dealership in Hollywood, California\nToyota executives hope to saturate the Americans second car market with their small and relatively inexpensive soil pet crowned sedans it took until the mid sixties for the company to gain a respectable chunk of the American market and in Nineteen Seventy five Twitter became the best selling import brand in the United states\nAnd this week in Nineteen Ninety a hundred and thirty two feet below the English Channel workers drill and opening the size of a car through wall of rock\nThis was no ordinary hole that connected the two ends of an underwater tunnel linking Great Britain with the European mainland for the first time in more than a thousand years the channel tunnel or channel costs Fifteen billion dollars employee nearly Thirteen thousand workers and took over four years to complete passenger service started on may six Nineteen Ninety four\nThat's your look back at this week in history might injure\nOccurred my priority was to get high to numb pain if it wasn't for team challenge I'd be locked up for that team challenges gave me hope for the future that I have never experienced before\nIt's so easy and the entire contribution stays right here to help our friends and neighbors in the ... metropolitan Lincoln area eight eight eight three four for hope that's the number we do all the work you make the phone call you make the appointment and change your life from adult in ... other ...\nDown from Louisiana and ... and we went from donating to the food bank ...\nMeeting in Hungary ... Feeding America that ... by feeding them that cat ... news radio of living\nTo in case they [noise]\n\nThis is the perfect example what I'm Talking about here you have a a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he he tweeted out to politifact today\nAre are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass shooters who are white males that were\nIf anything political leftist but you know that this is this is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that\nThey will uh they'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down and say OK okay but let's take this guy at the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of\nShooters in this kind of ... in this country\nUm\nTurns out that's not true it turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation a for all\nThe different ethnic groups in this country but uh your ears would you find out they've never mass\nShootings but I'm an overall pilots overall violence now you get into a whole other conversation about some communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed\nUm but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters immunity not our mail so as a river we're being told white males or the bad guys we have to be worried about their the terrorists they're the real threat\nI'm Don Lemon says that's what that other guy was a radio show I've never heard of jazz Ninety nine percent of shooters our our mail in this country\nThe country's also Seventy percent white so if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and the country is Seventy percent white but\nOnly fifty four percent of mass\nShooters are white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nUm of other groups that are non why their shoes so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places think they're really making about this I mean one member I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many are white mass shooters in the country so why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant and really pointless exercise uh\nBut they'll laugh like to do this because I think of us all based upon our\nOur ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity or whether we agree with that or or not um then you get a terrorism side as an officer to make this brief ah that that the torch mafia\nA moron from Charlottesville it's talked about so much in the media just goes to show you that they can't find where where's this these white nationalist I'm always hearing about I'm not saying they don't exist and say how many are there really very very few\nAndrew referred to that as a rise of a real terrorism in the country and now that the biggest terrorist threat and people like that or people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national counterterrorism center\nAnd the multibillion now going on trillions of dollars are spent on a security apparatus for this country of all kinds because we're

Chen K. F. A. B. count\nInsanity that that I'm Talking about so full of it is just it is just wild ... while to see this happening and you\nKnow that then there's also what I see from our own side and you know I've very frustrated with us today but not not surprising at all\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I Know he's not running anymore but you'd think that after all the time it's been a concern circles and here's here's Paul Ryan not a constitutional scholar not a lawyer but then again ... but\nI seem to know more about this and Paul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan a but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is a very clear political one yes part as an issue right before the election we can count on on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot and birth to ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... and following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is on track illegal immigration\nA [noise]\nThe fourteenth amendment is not\nClear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room right subject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a foreign ... if a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we'd go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdiction is he really subject to\n... I mean you know this is where he started to get it okay well on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American you're traveling in France and and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American taxes which you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm On French stroll French French joy on French soil ah I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say no you're subject to our jurisdiction so you're an American citizen I saw a jurisdiction has not just about geography\nAnd that's where this gets more that's where this gets more complicated and there are instances already of where you could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not be a citizen right in the case of the sons of er and taught us diplomats who were born here they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship\nSo that's\nA place where there's no clarity off and the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's pro this huge huge increases in guest worker programs\nAnd has just been so wimpy end immigration for so long and for him when he's not running again to come out now and say this and just get a kick in the ... to the G O\nP side I got to say I was I was pleased that at least at least Trump was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see\nThat are\nHere you go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right\nI'm Paul Ryan look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up it it it is an important issue\nBut that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here that yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay in maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels wherever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get them citizenship here\nAnd you know birth tourism\nI ... that is clearly not with the test but you know Ryan just can't help himself I he's the guy who clearly his all oh gee shocks I I think he is much more about Paul Ryan that he is about the party there I say and and that brings you back to how I don't accept this separation\nOf party and country 'cause I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party it's a you know they're bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just have one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe\nDonnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the U.S senator other Joe Donnelly here's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance and Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that\nBoth on the campaign side and on the Senate side\nAre state director is Indian American\nBut he does an amazing job\nOr director of constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine [laughter]\nIs this guy said I\nYou imagine if a Republican said I Know he misspoke but wow hey a producer Mike you there\nOh All right well Rouge or might you know cigarette break up a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're you're you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do that doesn't\nSound like much of a complement does it bread banks I think\nI mean Brennan you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board for this show people will be like oh\nYeah exactly\nSo this is what you get ... this is this is the Democrats the best and the brightest both the Democratic party senator\nJoe and Joe Donnelly this is this is what the other side offers up as a Republican did it that would

this position and the first places because Democrats have failed to come to the table staff failed to work with this president and passed legislation that helps protect our country that helps protect the citizens of America because they do not want to secure our borders they do not want to have a law and order a country\nThat the reason that we're in this predicament is because Democrats in Congress had failed to do their job and the president's going to look at any way possible that he can find\nA legally unconstitutionally that\nTo make sure that we're doing everything we can\nThis has been a long standing debate there's good faith arguments on both sides so natural reading of this amendment which seem to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the history\nThe tax some of the draft ers tend to go the other way and courts view clauses like misses having meaning they don't trust us dispensed them you can make a disease can certainly make a good faith argument that it limits birth racism birthright citizenship\nYeah you can\nSee your point you first of all the ... or the Democrats they can't have it both ways that can't be the law's the law\nAnd then be well but we're not going to do when you're in force band that let's not being mean and what's not separate families and all the rest of the you can have it both ways\nAnd they wouldn't have it both ways with immigration all the time they want to say they want a strong border but they don't want to enforce the law when it comes to people illegally crossing the border\nThey say they want an orderly immigration system but they don't want to do interior enforcement is that there should be consequences roiling the law but they don't want them to get prosecuted ends at home or anything else right so this is classic and then with the constitutional aspect to it I have to say the\nOnly thing that amuses me more than media lives discovering the constitution is written media lips discovered the Bible\nYou know and you know that's when all of a sudden you hear Corinthians to to like wait what\nWhat are they talking about\nUh so I\nI Love the I Love the\n... I'm going to read you now from the book of poems\nThey say in the media uh yeah so this is where\nYou see that they they have no actual principle that they are protecting or that there there are trying to Institute here because they're ... they're very literal list in a interpretation of this clause\nLet's understand is it's just not it's not clear what that means and also to take a literal interpretation of the constitution also takes into account what was it meant you mean at the time right this is where a liberal does go oh the road to bear arms you can have ... million in Brussels that's why we said arms\nYes at the time it wasn't a are Fifteen it was most kids but guess what it is arms and that's why it leaves it leaves open for what arms were then what arms are now\nAh and that's why the press the press is any dissemination of information the press is not an actual printing press\nAnd the jurisdiction there oh okay well what does that exactly mean what does that mean based upon the understanding that the time in what they were trying to achieve with this amendment with the fourteenth amendment\nI'm remember that the Obama administration um first of all there's all this there's all this rewriting of history now about what the Democrats have been doing an immigration for the last Twenty years and here's a here's a great example of of of that\nYou have Harry Reid okay this is even before that this was Nineteen Ninety three but this is Harry Reid who was among the most powerful Democrats in the country until recently this is what he had to say about illegal aliens play quibbling\nKept making it easy to be an illegal alien is now\nOffering a reward for being in a legal\nYou know same country wouldn't\nIf you break our laws\nWith US citizenship\nThat's right we do\nThis was like okay you know if if I Rob a bank I'll get in trouble but my kid who didn't do anything wrong you know my my baby when he grows up he gets the trust fund I made with the money from robbing the bank\nDishes ill gotten games they could try to think of it any other way they want they tried to go with other explanations of it but that's just the truth and you know ... now you have this debate over the fourteenth amendment of the fourteenth amendment let's just get right to it right now uh it's all about\nMaking sure that after the civil war has written Eighteen sixty six after the civil war", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Omaha", "day": "01"}
