we're getting a ... show on CNN there's ...\nI actually just the segments with that\nAnd back in the day\nAnd she decided to go after Trump on this notion of how it's a scary time for that she claims the president said it's a scary time\nFor young white men uh\nShe said quote white men have a lot of fear right now according to Trump\nUm that's not what he said he said it's a scary time for young

inserted in there why did that all of a sudden turn into an issue of women here's what the president said play\nWell I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you get the deal sea of something that you may not be guilty of living is a very very very difficult time\nI got boys and I got girls I Want to see what's going on right now it's scary for all things I mean I wouldn't want to know who you're scared most for your son or daughter I mean right now I'd say my son the other problem is that for the people who are real victims of these things when it is so obviously political in cases like this\nIt it really diminishes the real ... now\nNowhere in either their statements does the does the word white up here and this is very important I Would do because one of the

involve\nLaw breaking but here's somebody who\nForty year old woman thought that she would leak this information to the press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath that you

at\nYou know the last election twenty sixteen which was quite a spectacular day in the evening I think we have a lot of enthusiasm you know I keep hearing about the enthusiasm the blue wave but\nThink we have tremendous centers yeah\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough he uh he is I I could tell very optimistic about how it's looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's\nI'm really feeling it when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview or think of that same interview that that is really got me a concerned and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive\nAnd if if if it's cyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip sex\nOr anything in this country and say oh this guy but there's no inflation is very low on tape Powell my thing and I'm like get laid ...\nIs the fed because the fed is amazing race is too fast and it's independent\nSo I don't think to them [laughter] but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because he looked at the last ... numbers are very low\nThis is going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue\nAnd I would say this there were people that writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is a this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around\nWe're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even the debts Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached the point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough I'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there\nIs going to be some rough water and that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years\nTo keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles a student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans\nVery very high uh we're more in debt it now that when we were at the time of crisis in many ways and you know deeper and deeper in debt and we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally\nNow it would be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not I cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your cue John and uh all these other groups out there these far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does all of its rhetoric but they liked that they view themselves as resistance to Trump ... they like it they view themselves as a opposite\nAnd willing to take action about all this\nAnd with that uh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic reset\nRight if the debt turns into a crisis if all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent like that interest payments on the debt start to crowd out the private sector and the and the rest of our economy and that turns into a vicious cycle\nAnd things start to look bleak that is when radical ideology is like most likely to spread and that is when normal people everyday folks who are fearful could be swayed at that moment and you see this all throughout history they could be swayed to\nGo support a more radical path without even really understanding how far they're strength from what they have supported in the past\nSo I can see a situation where you know the Democrats continue their craziness they continue to be insane and it just stretches out for a couple of years\nAnd then all of a sudden when you have a massive drop in the market or you have you know unemployment start checking up very rapidly whatever and I don't know what it will be on when it will be\nBut that's when ... Bernie Sanders far left protestors and all the rest of it comes together\nAnd they offer a better way they say the only solution to this problem is to put more in the in more in the hands of the government the only way to solve this problem is to have a bigger government more government authority more government solutions\nAnd people will go forth and remember what I've told you and they don't teach people is in history class the reason that communism spread so rapidly around the world including in very developing sophisticated west European countries ended America\nIs because capitalism after the crash and after the uh the terrors of the first World War a capitalism was considered to have failed right capitalism\nWas considered a failure and people wanted hope for a better future and anyone who could talk about every one being equal everyone having enough everyone um you know being taken care of by the state you could understand why people say you know what maybe that is a better way to go you know because one they didn't have a track record\nIt's tie for me between a Latin in Lion King I mean their their neck and neck I think those are those are two of the best I'm also very partial to beauty and the ... you know it's a little more for him to be a little more for the ladies\nBut it's very well done was the first animated film ever ... okay back ... back to a descendant of the real Pocahontas\nHabit ah what what you saw here was that the left\nHas this whole framework of something that call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say\nUm you are not allowed to make the cuisine of another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the ah the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture boroughs and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time\nIn fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions\nToday come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a\n... you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting I mean you think of as a very wasp be northern northeastern American kind of a thing but now that comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCold culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren to claim that she was a Native American specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cook book called powwow chow and stole a recipe from my real French chef\nAnd called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be the next president states by the way you know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that I could have made that mistake you know\nThere's there's there's certain things that you can feel a little bit of a personal understanding of it and say you know what that person may be cross the line with that or\nThat went bad but\nI can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it a being that way I'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them are and and\nI played that story for yesterday where she talked about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really\nTheir parents were or\nYou know that that the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth Warren about a maybe eighth ninth tenth generation back\nNative American ancestor that's a that's pretty crazy that's pretty well but\nCultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to last will try it out once again unless it oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume oh I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can't we get some normal people involved oh who had\nSomething about you know this Halloween you don't wear a costume that's offensive twenty culture or a culture ancestry or whatever\nOkay so now that means no no no costumes\nOr somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just wonder you know what but if you're if you're not white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that non white\nFor a Halloween then so is it really just white people that are allowed to dress up in and cultural Garp\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear a Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing but\nI don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's write off for you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a power to remember political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a under represented in discriminated minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups and\nI'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes right to use those groups for their own power suppose your appropriation as stupid term but bottom line here is that if what Elizabeth Warren did knock cultural appropriation\n[noise] there is no such thing he does not exist even for ...
