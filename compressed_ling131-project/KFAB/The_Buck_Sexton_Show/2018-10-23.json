alarmed about this suppose an invasion of dark skinned\nA new Congress coming to America I mean ... the threat is entirely bogus because in fact border crossings have declined dramatically and the last ten years down eighty percent there is not this massive army of of illegal immigrants on these people are not even the legal immigrants they are refugees who are seeking legal admission to the United states\nIt must be a ... basing\nThing to have one so called yourself as Max Boot has to once called yourself a conservative\nAnd to have just completely become a turn coat\nAnd a boot liquor of the left wing which is what this guy is now going on CNN say whatever you have to say just crashed I guess all those people that he was writing for all those years right all those years this guy was building a career writing about\nAnd four and two conservative at least in his mind he basically was let's go to war with foreign countries or that you know we think we can remaking her image of a ... a very aggressive interventionist foreign policy guy\nI'm not really known for much else but but at least he was thought of is on the right now he was despised by his colleagues at the council on Foreign Relations I actually knew him and when I was in danger and they're blue or not and he was not like\nA by the other people that work there at all which I attributed to his conservatism at the time meeting I thought they didn't like him because he can serve nervous maybe it's just a jerk then to or maybe it was just always a jerk I don't know\nExactly like a jerk now I'm going to say that opposition to a seven thousand is going to be ten thousand probably by the week but uh seven thousand person caravan of concerns about that just waltzing in the United states seven thousand people in one one fell swoop is going to take\nProbably a couple of weeks probably three or four weeks it they're really on foot the hallway which I doubt I have a feeling that there'll be some buses and trains and things that all of a sudden are brought into service here to help them oh it was all just spontaneous they say yeah right\nNow but whatever it is they get to the border we're just supposed to let them into the country at this year's show\nIt's so intellectually lazy and for somebody who fancy themself and intellect is max Max Boot does it just goes to show you how how pathetic the whole thing is\nUh the intellectual lazy to say that it's fear of brown people that the problem here nobody would want seven thousand I don't care if seven thousand Canadians line up on the border and want to come into the country we have sovereignty we have laws this is a country\nWe didn't make it and I think that's that is one of the great things that people don't necessarily always know about it since the orchestra is it's an incredibly versatile\nOrganism there's sometimes we have the orchestra doing for different programs in a week and we'll be\nEducation program where our primary audience is early elementary school kids in the same week doing a program working with our Hispanic community to celebrate Hispanic heritage month at the same time rehearsing for the opera which is the next week and doing a symphony rocks show all in the same seven days and that I think is is the gift\nThat a single truck and bring to a community the numbers are quite staggering actually so when you think about the Hudson Valley in\nEffect over a hundred and twenty thousand people every year and of course the number of those folks are in our concert hall but I Would say over thirty percent or not and we've got twenty five thousand of our area students to participate in education programs all the way from mission imagination program is the\nFirst introduction to our\nPre school and early elementary

[noise]\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that is that\nWe did is one to replace the ice and put it inside the department of justice an organization that would at least have fidelity to the law what were you\nHonor or requests from Donald Trump's ice agents they if they provided the pain or requests were you honor it is governor or you work with Donald Trump yesterday offers the with your time\nThey won't answer them Jake that's important because that's what happens when so I ... I work with law enforcement when they're in the system they are convicted to maybe they ... ten years but it comes time to come out there is it the pain or requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that's the only two options\nAndrew will not answer the question me let me would be willing to release entered into all I knew\nHe won't answer the question that was Gillum and dissent is a dissenting was the one who was pushing them on that issue both candidates for ah ah for the governor of Florida\nAnd and trying to you know trying to get that last push here as we get very close and people are going to look at Florida they're going to say there is a bellwether state that tells you a lot about the direction of the country for the midterm election they're going to say that this is you know really\nDepends if the Democrats win it if you win who is the uh mayor of Tallahassee another person who I don't think they're going to run him and twenty twenty but they see him in a young a charismatic Obama ask mole so a lot of Democrats very excited about\nAbout Gillum and it was a ... a socialist I mean he's pretty he's pretty open about he wants single payer he wants to raise taxes all but he won't say that ... papers a bunch of things and you know we'll find some way but just that this was pushing them here on the issue of ice detained a request\nAnd noticed have Gillum would not answer because what this really is is a question about sanctuary city policies\nSanctuary cities do notch and now there's some variations year depending on which jurisdiction of the ... century city as a as a general rule\nDo not adhered to or do not on her eyes to request what that means is when someone is already in custody of law enforcement\nAnd immigrations and Customs Enforcement is informed that that person is in custody day Senate attain requests if they want that person to be turned over to them for the purposes of deportation\nThey\nRefuse sanctuary city jurisdictions refused to do that and what to send his nose and he had been a prosecutor is it that means that there are people who are a danger to the community who are convicted criminals people who have served sentences including sometimes are violent crimes\nAnd local jurisdictions because of the politics around illegals and because of the pandering to generally the Latino community by Democrats\nJurisdictions will not honor these detainee requests which means that people who are criminals and illegal aliens get released back out into the general population and can become repeat offenders\nAnd this is really a question of do you believe that law enforcement should work together you know I cannot think of another issue where if the FBI requested\nUh for example the FBI requested help from a sheriff or local law enforcement they wouldn't just not going to help they will be stonewall we refused to help you as a matter of policy\nRight and people realized that there's a lot of crossover there's a lot of ways unfortunately but it is true that even local crimes can get tangled up in the federal Web\nAnd so there are ... and just the FBI's viewed as a legitimate law enforcement body by most folks and so there's a lot of cooperation between those reading I here here's a verb example I work in the NYPD intelligence division I would sit in a city with seeded with pardon me a\nSuit in with a FBI agents da\nJack ... ah people from all these different federal immigrations and Customs Enforcement all these different agencies roasting together because stuffed up calling my radar would also be on their radar and we work together as a fusion center that's what I was doing that's my ... and of course also it\nOn the federal counterterrorism side in particular\nBut we understand it there's a lot of crossover law enforcement will somebody who is a drug dealer who is also an illegal alien is causing problems for the law and multiple ways and one law enforcement agencies should support the other law enforcement agencies legitimate law enforcement functions\nWhat Gillum is telling you without telling you is that he prefers lawlessness because it is politically advantageous\nHe won't say it but dissent is was right to push him on this one and this then goes to a a refrain that you've heard a lot from the left and I really hope becomes a huge problem for them in the in the midterms which is remember when\nI used that was the thing that they were\nChanting all summer not reform ice not change the law or change the policy at the border so that we could have a more efficient\nWay to transfer people so that they are with their children or they're at least close to their children and no they'll be reunited ... it wasn't have serious adult conversation about this it was nice it was street protest activism slogans in place of a serious adult policy discussion well that was a reflection\nOf where the Democrat Party is on this issue which is a kind of childish ... around there and their own series they are fundamentally on serious about dealing with\nImmigration and enforcement of immigration laws and they also will say things that are just bizarre like oh put ice on radio Jay okay so put ... put a massive federal bureaucracy that's in Ga chess put it in another massive federal bureaucracy the whole point here is that\nI as a point there making is that ice will not in fact\nAdhere to the law but the FBI will after what we see what the Russians stuff does anyone really believe that I mean you didn't even putting the FBI in charge of them are putting the deal Jay in charge of them is really gonna make things better\nOr these these are all these are just different executive branch agencies are there's there's no reason to think that that bureaucratic shuffling will make it any better but he but Elizabeth Warren goes even further you Elizabeth Warren who still thinks as delusional as she is as crazy as she is she still thinks she's got a real political future of the national stage\nI you know just as an aside here I think I've heard people say that maybe her plan was to do such\nA a ... such a dumb move that will become numb to the stupidity of it later on and then it can be used against her because she's already just fallen so flat on her face with it I I don't know if that's really possible but that I've heard people saying that\nBut here's what she says which is also a fall flat on her face stupid point ah here's what she says about immigrations and Customs Enforcement this was just a this week play a sex\nHow'd you say there is a a deafening silence Kim\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner most times some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I hear this people are media all the time and I say okay well what is it and then there's this has nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump meanwhile Menendez who\nI you know whether people want to just ... parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and they're just hoping to push us go over the line for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi this summer actually handed out to her members a toolkit a talking point about how they can supposedly go after Republican corruption Trump and and all sorts of other\nIssues none of which as you said there is any real evidence for but in the meantime they just close their eyes of the in some cases actually or outright helping I mean look the Democrats that's why it's called the call and smiling at corruption\nOr the biggest superPAC out their majority superPAC helping Senate Democrats decided to reroute three million dollars to help Bob Menendez\nIn his race on money that they're taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to defend seats\nOn and places where Trump won um because he's in so much trouble but in essence this is the Democratic party saying hey you know what we're OK with corruption I guess there's all trail of evidence that very clear in fact the Senate is on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can to return him to office\nYeah and I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous boxing loving and one of them is on this uh as as on the notion of corruption as much as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans would you have so many Democrats you started thinking of all the Democrats that have gone to prison and just in the last oh four or five years for\nIncredibly obvious a very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in any of this discussion as I said there's always this vague\nOh Trump most you know someone starts telling you about the mall humans calls get them you know that that tends to be what I hear about\nA but also on on the notion of moms I I have to say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land\nBut most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy look it's absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have\nCivil society we have to face it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing win an election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nThere is absolutely nothing written in any of that a formal or informal rules of our society that give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz out of hounding at a restaurant um this is the fact\nPrecisely why you have a ballot box and elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there are any way saying well eight not ma and be they're just saying what they think we all know that's not true I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper um or you go to vote [noise]\nUh but you know harassing people on the street is not and if that's the best they've got and conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy Maris\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and soda to ask you to make a prediction and who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic you see right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which new one hearing one especially on a mainstream media is how different this is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying with complete definite proof\nThat the Democrats blown it to a certain extent or they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down to five seats one way or the other right\nOn whoever does win and aren't going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nAll right give us Ross everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns and also her book the intimidation game Kim owns ... that you make the time forest come back soon\nBack\nYeah I I think he was smart on there with the it's going to be five seats it's going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all of the show election I obvious\nThey are but we're not going to know who controls the house I think I'm by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch well I guess the polls closed around age there's no way we would know OK yeah it was not even close but we might not even know till I don't know maybe the next morning it's going to just going to be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue ripple a little bit\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chases

C. and they really think that there's a national they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know\nThat that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them work with the pleads again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and Mohammed bin ... where ... cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore that is the fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis in a meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on her despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who is balancing literally bowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do it they don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nThe guy was and it is an opinion writer for the now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as sort of happened to him but the way they're talking about him it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile has anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean in American conservative Web and attack somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less\nOutrage about this just the fact it is just the if if it were someone who were critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered and but there is a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the coast Yogi was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs like your trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he wasn't Islamist ... nobody he wouldn't do not as if he were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean it should have been brutally murdered\nOh I I almost left out that he\nAlso a ... they dressed somewhat up as a body double and his clothing after they'd kill them\nTo try to create

knowledge and ... they were going to disappear and that was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it let me give you a little bit of\nEntail agency inside here\nYou're in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain regimes security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is right regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside\nUm and they get very adept at dealing with that threat but they also often operate and places where they can be really ham fisted I guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it\nAnd that's what I think happened here the Saudis the Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police state can be sluggish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug is in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nYou can't really be soaked audition turkey and that may have been the miscalculation here they thought that they could\nGet away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there is also a very by the way ... intelligence apparatus apparatus\nThat is at work so a

is really not that there's that consent issue because\nThey were talking about which who has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a is a fairy tale and really the only way for her to be awoken which is the the storyline is by a prince to kiss her\nShe saved her life by kissing her\nShow it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and therefore he does have consent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we are talking about this\nBecause if somebody is choking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that you were choking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking is the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some mouth to mouth resuscitation you know in a fairy tale is really what we're talking about here but they ran with this they didn't stop they weren't they weren't it wasn't enough for them to just say\nI have an actress say that because there was another one I forget who another actors came out oh I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries old stories that is instill very basic one\nCreative sensibility and young people but also have some basic morality and sales of good and evil and now they're fairy tales they're meant for amusement I\nPromise you I don't know a single guy who in college age was like well because the handsome prince ... the girl in a coma or I could just this girl in real life you're like no one would ever think

stuff is there\nBut you know this is what the what the left doesn't yet grass is that they lose on this stuff they lose on these cultural issues where they are acting like maniacs\nUm and and this brings me to not just this battle over fairy tales and consent\nBut this whole this whole story that broke today about how Trump is uh taking is telling the D. A. J. now um that they should this this is the story line at least\nA that transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration now that is such a loaded headline a that is such a loaded headline in so many ways one of them is that\nNo person can be defined out of existence a person as a person and all of us have equal rights under the law as people\nUh this is a question of whether you can create an additional protected class of people who have additional rights to everybody else based upon this designation of transgender\nAnd the left is very upset about this because the transgender issue they transgender rights or human rights very upset as it led to all the bathroom policy fights and there's this tremendous focus on this issue right now\nUh because they've you this is one of the places where Trump is being a you know Trump is being a Savage Trump is being so heartless and cruel and all the rest of it\nMeanwhile no one can really have an honest conversation on the left about what's going on here\nWhen they say that he's Trump is going to redefine and this is one of the very ah skewed ways\nThat we always have to have conversation with the left is that if something is one way for four thousand years and then the left as it is now another way the next day when we say well hold on a second I don't think that's really accurate they say oh\nThey ... they want to change this whole concept they want to change things it's a well I thought to be a progressive aren't you always changing things but this is central to how they operate the changes that progressive get in culture in law in society must\nBe considered permanent the changes that conservatives get even when it is it changing back to traditions and back to what\nWe all consider normative that disruptive and crazy and regressive in horrible so their victories are permanent ours are always up for\nFurther battles and further to further debate\nA transgender ism is a very tricky issue for a lot of people uh I ...

people\nTired of high taxes which we gave the tax cuts we've got so much that they want a strong military they want for executives I Want to safety they want security we give that the Democrats do not give that the Democrats don't know what they're doing they don't know what they're given I think we're going to do very very\nThe rise yes you know I think Trump's right I think that we're going to pick up Senate seats I think it's going to be fifty five you heard it here for fifty five Republican Senate seats by the by the end of this thing not quite the super majority of sixty although it would not be sweet\nMidterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I\nI think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separate the Democrats and Republicans at the end the day\nBut Trump is incredibly\nPowerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well which are the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore the legal and cultural edit fish of Obama is some\nWild Trump is president and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness\nAnd it really is it is moms or jobs and Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing they're okay is that they could be stronger on this\nBut on health care I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of very\nUnreliable GOP senators we don't actually have\nA real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm\nAnd Obamacare is garbage in Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual mandate but that\nAnd also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them you know they are not effective messengers on health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue\nOn the
