president cannot escape special scrutiny that the head of the parade\nUnleashed dogs of turning the\nRhetoric that comes out of that White House is not helpful it all\nOn their collateral damage\nTone and coming from the top and now than it has become a target\nHere now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that made it all looked at now that of all that top Democrats and the media what they targeted\nThe say there is no connection between what Trump has said about Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Eric Holder John Brennan and CNN and the thinking of the person who sent those pipe bombs is full already this is someone who has a weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list\nAre we switch there and that little montage replace it starts off with very prominent famous anti Trump Democrats saying all ...\nOf you know nasty violins\nGag rich Henri is that a word\nI think it's a word degrading I think I think I might have just made up degrow Tori is that I did I just make up a word or derogatory Decorah tore oh yeah yeah I did I just made up of word um yeah I just made up a word of live\nRadio that's interesting oh you know we'll go with it derogatory was what I was looking for [laughter] but but ... story sounds doesn't that although you know it kinda sounded like a word I kind of made up my word there for a second\nUh folks been a long way [laughter] you go but I you know that's when you know you're a real baller like Bush when when Bush said miss underestimated I knew exactly what he meant you know and that's not word when he called himself the decider\nThat wasn't technically a word either but it might as well up in a word and now it is a word I think it's great you know who's the decider will say oh who's the person who makes the decisions I don't know the decider\nUh anyway\nSo I made up or they're let's get back to the substance or so they they are all saying these things about Trump very\nNasty things very um two rockets or things and then they all immediately jumped to its Trump's fault it's Trump's fault that this clearly disturbed very yes dangerous and and and evil but\nAdded pathetic human being or decided to send these\nThese homemade there were pipe bombs and they were they were alive bombs I mean they could have gone off at this guy I knew what he was doing thank God they did not um but there's really no principle that the left is using here to determine\nYou know what is acceptable what is acceptable political speech and what is incitement it's just what is your side do that's bad but it's my side do that's okay and that's really the primary separation there's really not a lot to separate things beyond that there's not much that you can point you were you'd say\nYou know oh I see that there is some establishment of an actual\nBaseline of of how we can adjudicate these things no no no it's just my side good your side bad [noise] uh and we know that this was going to happen or it's just it's just very it's frustrating to see this um because it is so it is so obvious it is so clear oh\nGovernor Cuomo also wants to weigh in on the bombs let me first assert that a bomb is a combustible devised with explosive material that can be dangerous place Thirteen\nPolitical mania this fervor rancor hatred or you'll see this again and again and again thank God nobody got hurt [noise] I'm a I don't know if that was by design of the bomb or just a an amateur building the bomb\nBut we have to get to the genesis and the genesis is a holdover he did it free outlay political division in this country and it starts with the leaders and it starts with the president was heated rhetoric\nFought I think we also have to start talking to the American people and say hey\nThis has to stop this is not constructive it's not productive it's not sustainable\nI'm telling you they're only establishing rules for our side versus I can still say and do whatever they want there there is no good faith\nFrom the left in this oh\nLet's tone down the rhetoric is and it's just it doesn't exist they're not they're not planning to self police on their side at all I assure you it it it any differently than they already are I mean yeah sure sometimes they'll say crazy things and maybe somebody will speak out against it but it's not going to be any moving the goalposts here\nBut they want to use this as a way to to hammer our site they would like us to stop fighting they would win I mean I mean I've been fighting for our side fighting for what we believe in and what we think is best for the country\nOf one other aspect of this that I think we all need to remember is that there's nothing realistically that President Trump could do that would make them stop\nSaying that he is guilty of all this overheated rhetoric and bad stuff there is nothing that President Trump realistically could say that would make them stop\nAnd it does not matter how he modifies his behavior they will insist that his behavior is unacceptable no matter what he does so where's the upside down for the president where is the\nYou know where's the motivation to listen to them when all it means is that he'll be less effect will be less effective it is used rhetoric\nAnd they'll continue doing exactly what they do they're going to keep calling him a traitor there to keep calling him crazy to say that everyone supports them as racist and all this stuff but that's a more mainstream\nTrump is the one who is is inciting violence Trump is the one who is causing a causing problems\nAnd this is why I I knew this was going to be the case all week uh assuming that we got to where we are now are we know that this\nGuy is a wacko and\nIs going to be the right is going to be saddled with this with this complete you know look he's he's a dangerous he's a dangerous maniac so he's got to spend the rest of his life in prison and he needs to know the need to be serious consequences for this well you really you know that this guy is also I mean is it there's something sad about someone who is show\nShow deranged empathetic and an evil and just the whole\nThing I mean he's a really pathetic human being um but ... now we're supposed to act like this guy has supporters are this guy is representative\nOf a broader sense but on the right meanwhile do we have a country of three hundred and twenty million people\nAnd now I can think of er there's one there's one person that we can associate with being a Trump supporter or who since Trump has been president\nPeople would say oh well\nYou know he's a he's a lethal threat because of his uh what he views as his politics um but now that they're going to make this\nYou're going to hear about this for ever is never going to go way they're going to be talking about this one I mean they still talk about oh an abortion clinic bombers from like the Nineteen nineties and things like Nineteen Ninety three you'll still hear about bombing abortion clinics hasn't happened and you know a very long time but that's\nAnytime you talk about terrorism and and then you also get into this whole discussion and\nI wanted to discuss it with the young Turks guy who was on my show on rising morning with junk we're now we're going to hear again you watch next week there'll be this oh right wing terrorism is the really scary terrorism right wing terrorism kills more people that tends to be the\nThe headline that they lead with and I always have to point out well\nThe big issue there is one do you exclude nine eleven from it ah that's first and foremost\nBut then also there's a whole bunch of other things like how do you really count this what is the determining factor whether something is counter to terrorism because with some of the federal\nStatistics that they look out for this they'll say well you know neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stab someone to death Nicole ...\nWell if the guy was a minority they'll say it's terrorists now is that a hate crime is murder yes is it terrorism though in the way that we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit\nA little bit less ... less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but is it terrorism uh and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion\nAnd from the statistics forwarded attacked him in the moment that you start looking at worded attacks and you realize that radical Islamic far and away the biggest threat that we\nYou know you look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal most of them a column I mean these are attacks would have killed hundreds of people most of the right wing terrorism at the site with a with a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most of the right wing terrorists may site is single acts of violence against individuals by\nA neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again heinous\nEvil or crimes that should be punished the full extent of the law but it's not strategic level national\nThreat terrorism the way that radical Islamic terrorism is but I'm just telling you you're going to now that we got this guy who's been captured today\nThis this says our fellow says are uh say rock whatsoever keep forgetting is how ... last name I mean everyone remembers his first name but not not studied everyone's saying uh everyone's saying that\nYou know he's obviously so pro Trump Betty such a bad guy or ... or ... say opposites Iraq say are\nOr what is a we know what it is\nI mean his ... I mean is American but what what is his his parents nationality or as parents parents nationalities wondering if there's any bees is first name says are that's the kind of unusual\nAnyway [noise] ah yeah they're ... they're going to run with this though and this is where we have to deal with now this is not going away anytime soon it's a unfortunately going to be used against us and [noise]\nI don't know if it's going to sway the midterms I really hope that uh do since I Hope that people can see that this is just one deranged maniac but ... you're gonna see floods ... zone coverage of this issue for the next\nSolid week and change because they want this to be first\nAnd foremost on the minds of many voters as possible and they're going to be they're going to be really pushing this they really want people to think that this is this is what will be on the lookout for the real concern is white winters when there's going to be crazy people of all kinds of all places [noise]\n\nHere's a tweet from President Trump for\nTwitter has removed many people from my count\nAnd more importantly they've done something that makes it much harder to join the staples gross to a point where it is obvious to all a few weeks ago it was a rocket ship now is a blimp total bias\nThat's from the leader of the free world my friends who has an enormous Twitter followers that he knows if something's up if you don't trust these social media giants do right by you any more there are other places to go ...\nDot com is a new social media site that has none of the biased none of the left leaning agenda nonsense that is going to be shadow banning people kicking you off the platform for deciding what you can say in what gets the\nS. and M.

is you know why why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur hedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrity good on the list and these are people that have amassed incredible fortunes\nAll Democrats why are they all Democrats\nYou know what what I find to be the case is that people people that have had to work incredibly hard and overcome tremendous struggle to make their money uh tend to be at least more fiscally conservative\nPeople that when the genetics lottery by being incredibly beautiful Hollywood people or people who get really really lucky with you know

trying to make a a business work that you started yourself I just find that those people in my experience\nAre concerns I just\nThat's the only way I could explain the difference in the economic philosophy here uh but Obama was preaching about even more than than just the notion of the powerful and the privilege and how they want to hold onto their stuff he also kept talking about the economy play that play Seventeen\nWe're\nPeriod [noise] and Republicans had been cutting\nBack for the rich [noise] they've been cutting rules for banks [noise] and we\nFinancial crisis in our life [noise] and Democrats [noise]\nAgain [noise] it's been\n[noise]\nWell why did it start with Obama\nHow how about we've had even we had an even bigger\nFinancial pull back with a Great Depression and we recovered from that and went and entered a period of huge economic growth and a boom I mean Obama really at what point does he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years into the Trump presidency we're still hearing about\nHow ... reminder by the way Obama never achieved a three percent growth GDP Growth for an entire year never\nOnly president in history for whom that's the case so when do we get to say that this is just ridiculous\nThat what he's saying is is transparently false and and I would also note you know the uh the government was the problem with what happened in the great recession and liberals don't ever talk about this\nYou know when he says the Greek banks and all this stuff that's what happened no it would really happen was a liberal said that banks to lend to people who can't pay back\nBut if you can't pay it back and you happen to be non privileged and particularly the fall into certain minority categories\nThen banks have to lend you even though you're bad you're a bad bet for a loan and you do that enough and the federal government backstop those loans and says well we'll we'll pay if these people to fall we we've got you got you covered Wall Street\nAnd Wall Street does what it does that's what really happened [noise] you know one question Obama should be forced to ask or be forced to answer rather by someone in the media would be what exactly did you do that was so great for the economy what exactly does does he think got and it was a ...\nThe chronicle gotta go gotta going how ... what exactly did he do and I think the truth is it's very clear he has absolutely no answer I mean the stimulus was was atrocious soon as was a huge waste of money and that was money that\nWas just put on the tab for future generations to pay so what ... what did Obama bring to the table when it came to get an economy of running answers you don't even have an answer\nHe's just out there it's just all demagoguery it's all so shallow but really that's a good summary of what we have for eight years of Obama\nTo all the business owners HR folks anyone who's hired anybody across the

it comes to the fight for shell shocked never\nGot to\nSay I thought this was a fantastic story in that it lets me do one of my favorite things which is beat up on millennials which ever in the media does including people like me or technically millennials are you know this is where you make the hack need avocado chose joke\nA this is where you get to talk about safe spaces and pajama boy at all that stuff\nAh this was in a this was in the daily wire was that the earlier this week that there was a it is a study from San Francisco State University that claims that twenty five percent\nOf all millennials are suffering from get ready for it\nPeachy Estee now\nPie DSD is incredibly serious obviously the DSD is something that if you have for real reasons is a deserving of the most serious treatment and and assistance and helping and sympathy\nBut they've got beat DSD because of the election that's right they are so psychologically traumatized because Trump won the twenty sixteen election that they are now considering themselves to be\nOfficially a officially suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome to a clinically significant level\nA clinically sniffing level so you know this this is what I Would say goes into the pile of evidence that I'm building up\nI mean they'll have to do a book or a product on this about how the left really has lost its mind I don't mean that as in oh I'm I'm trying to be funny about them or I'm I'm doing the usual thing that people do on radio or uh in in political media which is you know you exaggerate\nTo get attention no no I I mean that there are a lot of people in the lead to have had a real clinically I'm a possible to evaluate nervous breakdown that they have lost it I mean they've lost it in a profound way a and\nThis is this is telling us that that's exactly what happened you know I always try to tell folks ...\nWell you know what my my main thing with with the liberals that I Know my liberal friends is when I when asked\nMe they say oh I don't understand how you don't know the countries in so much trouble or institutions they got all all bummed out about all this stuff really just you know Trump is destroying America and they they cry about it and they get really upset\nOr or they don't well hope they don't actually cry but they they want about it\nI Try to tell them you know it really doesn't matter to you as much as you think it does these things that you keep talking about you know are fraying institutions it's not going to affect your job is not gonna affect your home and doesn't affect anything that you think it especially when you're talking about stuff like Russia collusion and but I I really do believe that\nThere is a a big part of the general population that likes the anxiety of catastrophe that they like to\nCling to this notion that oh my gosh like this terrible things going to happen and I'm not saying that aren't real\nConcerns that we should all have I mean you know first and foremost among them as you know we're all gonna die that's the truth that we have to deal with right there there are some real things out there to be worried about um ... we are probably going to explode or currency at some point and you know the our currency has a\nHas an incredible track record historically of always always\nLeading to financial disaster it has it has never been avoided currency leads to financial disaster there is a hundred percent\nA track record of this so you know that's a real concern a disease that is in terrible because of all the antibiotics you know especially antibiotic resistant bacteria and uh you know a mass infection or ... mass\nViral ... things like that that's real concern and day to day concerns are very real you know how you get along with your friends and family and how you doing at work but the concerns that liberals obsess over\nOr delusions or this notion that the planet is going to die and I mean that quite literally the entire planet will die unless we start making insignificant modifications to our day to day lives\nAre with regard to shield to emissions that's crazy that it's not based in any reality that's not a normal thing to be worried about that's not a normal thing to think that's just bonkers\nAnd when you start to look at the other things that get liberals really upset and Russia collusion and election security and all that\nUh they they are worried about things for the sake of worrying in many cases but the problem is they believe that they don't know that they're doing that always speaking of a of of uh\nYou know very real pie TST ah I saw you know in in one of the opening sequences of picky blinders which is an excellent show 'em and they really make use of the backdrop of the first World War\nI and in terms of what it did to people and coming back from the first World War having served in the trenches and you know there's one guy who is clearly he's continuously shell shocked us be TST you know it has not been able to readjust when he comes back\nAnd I'm always amazed at how historically we sort of just think of the first World War as a prelude to the second World War and well that's technically true first world war was her recent beyond\nAnything that we have ever seen in in the history of warfare with the only exception\nOf the second World War right so\nI think people think that the first one was a you know a lot of wars things happen you know the second World War though was really okay yeah that was the biggest\nThe biggest military conflict in human history but the second biggest was the first World War\nI guess that's why you have the names World War but uh I think it often gets left out of a particularly in in ... you know there's so many movies about World War two who's a World War one that really tried to bring it home to you not just the war itself but the aftermath of the war and I think that's an interesting component of of piggy blinders which I'm excited to\nA man it's kind of a cold rainy D.C weekend I'm going to be Netflix ... blinders I'm telling you it is really solid show the only problem I have with it is that it uh it's kinda hard to understand some of the accent she came across some times you end up sitting around going\nWhat the heck was that ... those because ... Birmingham broke that these guys have is not always easy to not as you get through but I highly recommend\nThe blinders if you're looking for a new show and you haven't watched you haven't watched it before I Would put it very near the top of your Netflix queue\nOr so I Want to talk to be a little bit about a Halloween here coming up in a moment I've just you know what it's a friday and it's been it's been quite a week in the news cycle so we'd do a lot of policy a lot of serious talk on the breaking news talk\nCulture is just a way that things are John ... a ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things\nAnd any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state\nOf appropriation and evolution\nAnd the only way that culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only be part of the general cultural as most is like that for a lot of fun fun word there\nThat everybody else is engaged that as well\nBut now I also remember some of my my best and worst costumes over the years John do you ever do you have a a costume and you're either very embarrassed about are very proud of\nDon't be showing don't I don't think I've ever dressed up as an adult dressed up for Halloween as an adult now\nBut I don't see how it is I see you're calling me out and see what's out there is a producer Mike is he going is he talking to a naughty nurse's right now are sea within earshot of the microphone I think he's talking to an already secretary over somewhere that that sounds that sounds about right or you know every every time I think that we could get we can catch Mike on the Mike\nIs he's out getting phone numbers um but I and I can tell you my best costume ever was actually when I was a young adults in my early twenties in DC\nI found a theater supply store so I got invited to a big fancy Halloween party and I I uh theater supply store and they let me rents because you want to get really high in costume and not spend a lot of money got to rent it and I rented a full\nOn theatrical production costume slash kind of uniform replica of general Douglas MacArthur I mean with like the ... and a pipe\nAnd the sunglasses and the whole thing man that costume was legit by the way pen to lose be surprised how much attention to\nThe ladies gave to a guy walks around wearing wearing the ... so that was a very good costume I dressed up as Bjorn Borg one year\nOr with a kind of a ... you know the seventies style tennis out fix I just basically shrank a a shirt and a lot in the in the drier by accident and I had a head band than an hour wouldn't tennis rackets that worked out so I don't I don't have any fantastic costumes I'm not somebody who\nIs is quite as up on on their costume game as many others but I I Hope if you do go out this weekend appropriate all the culture you want and if you want to or not it costs you guys or girls ... ladies and gentlemen by all means that is that is you're right because darn it\nThis is America a but obviously you know be safe don't don't eat too much candy corn and don't drink too much\nSpike or what's wrong with candy corn pumpkin juice do ... candy corn rots your teeth as you're eating it you know the site and it's not like you know they might finally\nAppears so I'm asking buddy what what is your what is your best or worst or both\nHalloween costume and you can remember I was never a huge Halloween guy I mean I can I add the loved it but then I thought I didn't get too much into it but one year it was actually a watch my buddies and friends did a group thing and we did the ah\nAddams family and uh I Would go mess Adams I'm\nAnd that was fun actually 'cause there was like seven or eight of us and individually people were like ... who are you like what are you doing and then but then when he got all together it was like oh you guys are often\nSo that was that sort of\nNice or go to Nate Halloween parties\nThat ...
