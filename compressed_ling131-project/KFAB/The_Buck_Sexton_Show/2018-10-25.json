Jeff Zucker released this official statement from CNN the president of CNN released this in ... ... ... you know President Trump had already said what are the audio that I played for you of\nYou know there's no place for for political violence in American society not or threats no that's the president says\nHere's how the president of CNN response quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nThe president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter not far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThis is it just disgusting low blow from the president of CNN that's what this is this is it the president's fault that some lunatic this is the president of CNN saying it's it's the president's fault the president's\nWords that are tied to this in some way right away without even knowing without even knowing who this is or what the real motivation is\nThis is the this is a disgrace\nAnd there's no shortage of this rhetoric coming from people now they they view this as a means of getting even with Trump now you know and\nAlso view this as wiping away what had become a very powerful narrative because it was so true that the ...\nLeft is a bunch of screaming mob ing maniacs\nNow they're going to say oh it's both are now now the the the entirety of the Democrat power apparatus\nAnd all of its all of its media wings which CNN is certainly one of them are going to claim victims status over this all the way up until election day before we even know who did it before we know anything about what they've done\nAnd you know I I'm Sorry but I Do not remember\nI Do not remember the head of Fox News or the head of you know it and forget about the head of it and they do not remember ah the the biggest names in the business that I Am in Rush Limbaugh Sean Hannity or you know Glenn Beck I\nDo not remember any of them\nSaying oh it's it's the fault of CNN for example it's the fault of CNN that a Bernie Sanders supporting lunatic\nActually shot Steve ... and he almost died and tried to shoot a whole bunch of conservative members of Congress\nBecause of their insane rhetoric because of their\nThat they've been calling the president of the United states oh trader or Russian huge a crazy person a rapist or race is a white nationalist effectively a clan member and they've said he's destroying the country he's undermining our institutions\nSomeone must take action someone must do something about this\n\nAnd here we are here we are\nAt a point where finally there's a moment where the Democrat power structure feels like they are under threat and I and I I Am the ... I you know I Am consistent on this you do not\nHurt people hit people attacked people or worse because you don't like their ideas\nYou don't do it nobody should do it knowing justified and doing it it's disgusting it's illegal it's immoral and it's\nIf you really are a true believer in some ideology at least in America right now it's truly counterproductive because right now\nIf you\nTake those kinds of actions your entire side might have to bear the consequences so to speak so it's it's wrong and and and evil and stupid on every level but it's the Democrats who have been trying to blow these lines for the last six months or so\nAnd it's the Democrats who have been saying all those things about President Trump since he became president and as I've been telling you if you really believe that we are descending into fascism as a mainstream\nLeft wing writers will have been saying if you really believe the front of the United states is a threat of starting an unnecessary nuclear war\nIf you believe those things\nThen\nTaking extreme measures does not seem like such a leap does it they have not been pushing back on Trump for tax reasons they have not been pushing back on Trump's for you know health care with\nAny of the same vigor and seriousness and ferocity as they have on all these fantasies that they have conjured around Russia collusion and twenty Fifth Amendment of Trump is crazy and he's going to start a war\nAnd now and now they want to pretend that oh it's it's Trump's fault that this happened\nAnd this is right from the very top this is right from the top of the Democrat left wing power structure in the media Jeff Zucker himself\n\nGeoff my assistant is going to be overheard by a friend of mine declaring that CNN has declared war on Trump that's right that happened Jeff Zucker\n\nNow I can sit here and say without any feelings of of ah she position is\nThat my criticisms of CNN all stand\nCNN is a dishonest news organization\nThat is pushing an agenda that age furthering division in this country that lives about the president addresses it up as news coverage and that has a lot of coddled babies like Acosta and others\nWho refused to accept that you know if you want to be taken all kinds of shots at the Republicans in the president maybe they're actually going to criticize you back with words with words they're allowed to do that\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I can also sit here and say I am happy to hear that no one at CNN was hurt that I have friends including some very dear friends who still work at CNN and even if I hated everybody CNN which I don't\nI Would still pray for every single one of them to be fine and come out of work on skates and go home to their families and I do feel that way and I know you feel that way too\nBut there's something deeply wrong there's something unseemly and unethical about immediately trying to make it or will you can still criticize us and hope that we're okay you can't condemn\nThese bombs being sent to us but also\nContinue to criticize us no I I I can and will and it's not just CNN it's all these other into you know it it's it's George Soros is doing the funds incredibly destructive incredibly destructive\nPrograms for freedom in for liberty in America I mean he he he is behind a lot of very bad stuff\nUm\nAnd then when you out of you know then you add into this also obviously the the Obamas and the Clintons of people who are ideological opponents\nDoesn't mean that I hate them I don't\nRespect the Clintons but I mean I you know I I disagree strenuously with the Obamas I don't really respect the Clintons but that's a different thing I've lived in that respect but that doesn't mean that I Would ever advocated violence against any political figure anyone for their beliefs for that\nMatter but not not even a day passes not even a day passes\nFor us to deal with this issue to figure out who's the hottest to figure out what's going on or without it\nBeing used right away in the most obvious fashion to score political points but I'm just going to say the Democrats think this is the way they can actually then ensure they win the house and maybe stop a a red wave in the Senate that's what they think this is that's\nWhat they're using this as a month and they brought this on themselves I'm not saying that this is a false flag must have any of

responsible for the climate weren't that Donald Trump\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down the ... the political rhetoric and they are making people let's say they are making journalist ... they and they are making law enforcement officers let's stay\nLet's remember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media\nBut there's an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually attacking will demonize those\nDo I believe the heated rhetoric good toxic environment\nIs part of this\nYes we're in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the

and that makes it very clear that they will not be happy and Joe ... some of the top people in the White House or arrested\nI mean they want them to go to prison that that's clear from their coverage they want to see them in cells the left doesn't just want Trump to no longer be president they want him to be ruined and destroy an error concocting narratives to achieve that they're not just open borders are trying to make it happen\nI've talked to Carter Page I've talked to Papadopoulos jockeys got this whole thing is we're Jewish about Russia collusion it's insane\nAnd what does Russia collusion really at its core what does it all about Trump is a traitor that's what they're telling Trump is guilty of treason that's what they're saying I'm not making this up\nI'm not exaggerating pressed the United states is a creature according to major media is a trader according to Democratic Party with no evidence but not\nAnd they want to talk about demonizing place\nOr I Know we don't

narrative away from damaging things for the Democrats you bet\n... that's just as that is true it does do that so there's no question about that they'd much rather talk about this and Trump's rhetoric

Democrats say time to take the temperature down let's stop calling drop a traitor lift up calling Trump\nSupporters white nationalist and racist I didn't see any of that I I just\nDon't remember it

than others here is the view host sunny hopped in eleventh\n\nI was in tech thing with my former colleagues at CNN ... and they're scared and one highly former colleague that this is what happened when the president called the enemy of the people have to try and I thought my gosh you know it's it's the tone and coming from the top\nAnd now than it had become a target journalists that are simply trying to do we still don't know anything yet about where this is coming from and let them know to that\nIt's an end who the person or that people are behind it though I I can point just a careful

here between or clear link between all these different yeah these are these are powerful Democrats who have been targeted but that they've been targeted doesn't tell us why they were targeted as in the motivation the old motivation of the perpetrator\nAnd connected to the president is just it's just disingenuous a disingenuous a\nReally doesn't have any evidence there's ... there's nothing to hide this to other than they think that Trump is mean to them sometimes well do they go to the German when Trump is not being mean to them\nDo they get to determine when Trump has finally been

are despicable and have no place in American society [noise]\nI Want to assure you we deployed the full resources of the FBI or the United states Secret Service they're working very closely with law enforcement officials will continue to monitor these investigations and those responsible will be brought to justice\n[laughter] yeah yeah yep yep yep\nThat's what the vice president says does that change any of the ... or any of the junior here I'm from the media and there's no I actually saw someone said today or I forget what the journals another blue check you know Twitter journal person\nUh say that the Trump statement where he said there's no place for political violence in this country or threats in this country that that was the bare minimum that he said the bare minimum I'm like well does he have to give us an hour long speech on this er ... there's going to criticize the matter what he does\nWhether it's cause show gay or this or anything they just they hate him they absolutely hate him\nYou know earlier today actually there were just talking about the president's it's such a liar oh he's such a liar so terrible noticed you know my objections to Obama that I thought he had bad ideas\nHe wasn't nearly as brilliant as the media pretend that he was and he was arrogant and he was doing\nBad things from policy level actually don't have any personal beef with Obama like I didn't I didn't know it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I'm going to bomb us or you know that's that seems admirable but I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with them I didn't hate him though I didn't go to bed at night thinking\nAll that that that's come Obama wasn't some maniac but that's how they feel about Trump\nAnd now because some maniac somewhere we don't even know why yet but some of the Exxon we're sent these bombs now we're supposed to believe what Trump is supposed to be muzzled me here's what they were saying about an earlier in the day is liquid for\nHow sorry the president flat out lie saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election he gets caught the lie he changes his story again and says we're going to get through it eventually the president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid were officially and parents and in fact ...\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with outright false\nHe's not even trying to hide his life anymore he was putting all out there in spreading a lot of lines about non white people to fall white crowd to make a well a lot of what the president saying sets\nNot true the same to me in a bit of the fat free frenzy frustration and health oxygen sales why\nThis is a an an article of faith now do you have to say this all the time when ever asked them what what's\nThe lie what they're really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your health care plan you can keep it that President Trump has told one that was done with forethought with malice and that had impact on the lives of tens of millions of Americans negative impact\nWhat what is the law that lines up with that\nHis crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable\nGenius you know a lot of the stuff that he says you and I can recognize as him kind of joking around and talking as normal people do there oh he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always always jump right to the worst possible scenario\nAnd never get tired of it either oh my gosh you know the the left in the media they they find endless ways to reach a Lebanon the outrage meter China's not enough let on the outrage me in regards his brother\nI Know I I just get frustrated with it too it's it's so tiresome and they're all their calls for civility right there there are being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really from a lot of these a prominent leftists\nTheir calls for the right to be silent and to start getting pummeled again\nThey like the old order where we sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules and were nice\nAnd we get punched in the face and say oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that's what they want us to go back to Trump doesn't play that game they're not saying let's all be good to each other day defend the mobs in the restaurants we'll talk more about that later\nThey defend these tactics that it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control every one they're favorable to\nThis stuff and now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down after Eighteen months of propaganda diving to their base the president's at trader a sexist a rapist or a\nYou know a racist or everything crazy going to start a war is a fascist state there's stuff they've said about President Trump but it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life it is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close now they're going to be the stability please come on\nWho takes this seriously if people are these people are really\nIn need of a reality check 'em really got Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here I don't know Joe Scarborough never met him don't really care to\nA but this is a guy who was his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... when it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and scarred wasn't opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to because the with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump is not him in Mika a now because Trump is something that's not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump rage rants and first to him today is on Christ like I mean this is here's what's covers that play six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame that we ever had a president like this one a vet turned his back on the most basic [noise]\nNot only the most basic American concept of what we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting here legally what Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American I Will just say this is a guy that was raised in Southern Baptist church\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read it sounded Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and a side in the Bible to criticize Trump I mean this guy has no shape\nNo shame whatsoever I mean he goes over at MSNBC and uh ... that show up for sale in the morning I hear so much blather and so much nonsense as long as anti Trump you know the audiences you it's good to like the that works really it really is an embarrassment but\nYou know people people believe what they want to believe unfortunately this world my friends and you know I'm hearing the swap what'd you find out more and\nMore is that so many of these folks that that thinks that they're standing proud for the truth the media they're really just it's all about their own their own brand their own paycheck on their own access all the time\nThey don't know what they do if they weren't doing his job and they just want to get us cause you to power responsible and if they're not in the Trump orbit they want to be as far away from it as they can so they can be in the anti Trump orbit and there's very few people that you can try to strike any kind of neutral balance anymore I mean this is just that this is the media war\nWe're in the midst of a media war the notion that those who started this war in the mainstream media are the ones who are not calling for civility is just preposterous really is\nUm I Want to talk about the mobs and all that coming up in a moment but ah\nWe have we have we have much more just 'cause I don't want to be labor at this point to that because we don't know enough about the bombs I Do have Joey Jones coming on a little bit to talk about what we know about the devices themselves will get to some of the technical aspects of this we're all really up to speed on that and and also just\nWhat it takes to um you know get some of these\nBut it takes to build a build some of these devices what kind of skill set or we really talking about so we'll we'll get into that I'll have an update for you on the on the caravan coming up\nA which is all of a sudden it's really going to drop out of the news cycle very quickly and I think it's because Democrats realized this does not the the Democrats pushing all of a side in their quest to do everything they can for illegals not not a winning issue for them and they they don't doesn't work out the way they think it's going to work out ever\nUm without an and much more if you want to call it for for nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred bucks I'll be right back\n[noise] radio and [noise]\n\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud where the retired FBI

Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an EEO detect so he was all about explosive ordnance\nDisposal Johnny Was was wounded in combat in his role as an EEO detect\nAnd that he knows everything about these devices how they're built how you tracked them and what they can do a job and great to have you on that thank you so much\nYeah thanks for having me on today\nAre so from what we know right now let's just go to the what what can we what can we say about these devices bunch pipe bombs and he said the jurors any sophistication or lack there are but what's notable to you about these bombs\nWell you know I can only go off really the the information we be giving and and the one picture that's out there so I Want to put that out front say it's purely speculative are just going up what we see what we hear it so what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nAnd it had some sort of timing device on the outside of it was doing it for both ...\nAnd the idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the bomb did either\nOnce that time or hit a certain time at a pre determined time in its past life it would turn on a lie or sell the noise and so what you do your ticket same signal that same electrical signal reroute that into a circuit that that the bombs so that\nOne normally the light would come on the bond at night so but normally the bell would ring alarm clock\nThe bond at the age of the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so it's so switched to the break in a circuit that an arming at arming mechanism as another breaking the circuit so circuits still open\nBut once the army gets closed in the next thing they closed the switch set it off so we know and and the use of devices they're used for one or two things either to predict turban when the bomb goes off or to keep yourself with the bomb maker time to get away from it\nBefore it's aren't and so if this bomb is a functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture\nBut if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way\nThen we would call this a time device or other time to arm or trying to that day and being that it was going to steal package and there seems to be no other true mechanism of of the nation than we have to believe from what we can see that picture\nThat at the time to detonate device meeting they said you know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it would theoretically detonate\nNow that's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey ... in this this is going to be a very\nUh ... the sloppy way to try to target an individual right Abby assuming this was actually sent through the mail to just have a timing device on it and you'd have to be guessing when it would be you know it sounds like it's more likely it could blow up still risk to people could really could kill somebody but could blow up\nIn the mail processing center in the mail man's hand perhaps or eight on any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much it is to divulge and detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening that certain things that\nYou know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or go into too much detail\nAbout how boundary made about Ninety percent of what you put it to a bomb as readily available at Walmart idiots races on the Internet\nThere's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured and uh and so what we have right now this is the vice meaning that it\nCould function as as as it appears to\nThen uh then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or a pick apart what is there to recover some of those pieces that perhaps there some signatures so specific parts of the pieces\nMore easily point it's in the right direction when I Would say where do you really I'm just like an off in a shipping of the package if\nYou know the one that we're looking at it now seems to be the hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage and was it actually put through a a delivery service or that someone just handed stock is someone outside and say hey I'll give you twenty dollars to take that you're already\nWe don't know and those those lead those human lead\nThe tracking the shipment that's the first place will go in the meantime someone probably over ... go with the FBI will utilize some tools techniques we have this safely\nI think I understand [noise] God finding that potatoes for French pie or rats at everything you know why don't you

have I understood that board\nCouncil news radio\nEleven to see\nIf we can you hear and you look for in the last week actually following\nYou are doing this I mean I I must have ten people have been yelled at until they had to leave for restaurants all conservatives is that okay with you know I Am okay with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nAnd Mitch McConnell yes Mitch O'Connell is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton tried and I walk up and eating out or you know but I get\nIt it's not clear that there was Hillary that she leans there's somebody something being unpleasant and something being okay I'll take your protesting something you're disagreeing about you know I I if I got paraded children from their parents and I went to dinner and a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't ... high endorsed turn turn up\nSo there you have the big separation okay I especially in a day like today where we're going to be a lecture by the left about about stability all of a sudden keep in mind that that exchange that was on TALK across and show not tonight but last night\nUh that exchange was between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide Felipe rains and of course Tucker\nWho people will say looks like book so it's bucking took a or people say that I look like Tucker but they don't do it they don't know any takers clearly Tucker looks like me uh but\nThey're having a search engine you notice that that he makes it clear rains makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know the harassment and stocking and mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like that is acceptable they don't\nSay oh sorry this is just some other thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't endorse or we're not associated with this isn't representative of us\nThey actually try to justify this behavior and I keep having to point out to people that the the line between if are at a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever or or even just the family members or friends and people were cursing at\nMe and yelling at me and threatening me the line between that activity and someone getting\nTheir nose broken on either by me or buy them right I mean on one side or the other is that line is\nVery thin very small all it takes is one person who thinks they're going to give you a little ... of one person who just cross easily they're already screaming your face they're already yelling at a restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you and trying to intimidate\nYou\nYou really think that art for one of them to all of a sudden you know give a little shrug it a little push and things get out of control\nYou know the answer to that\nBut what so important is that the left I you know as soon as those idiots went after Nancy Pelosi I said in every other conservative but I Know and and respect came out and said those people are are more on\nWhat they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong but by acting in that way and they they really did the progressive left the diplomacy wing of the Democratic party a big favor\nOf but oh by the way they talk specifically about that and rains 'cause they they have to pretend there's some consistency Rangel say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay what did it blows he's okay put Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until she leaves her restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I'd never okay I think what happened when Nancy Pelosi was fine\nThe other day she was ... and ... she was with her and you don't see any of us up and said Nancy Pelosi I'm going to yell at you until you leave the palm because you have a ... policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think it all for one thing you got to go out and that's not what happened was I just don't do it because they're not ... in the last ...\nLook I think it needs to be said and I appreciate the Tucker set it and you know thank God that people like soccer have the kind of plot for may do or they can push back on this nonsense conservative we had a political culture\nAnd in our political culture in this country\nIs unacceptable to a you know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now who say they're in public but I mean they're not\nThey're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not and look I think the behavior when they're on stage is bad but it's just it's just different degrees right it's one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heckle people on Capitol Hill I think that's childish and stupid and you should get arrested but I don't think that it's\nYou know I I don't think it's it's certainly dangerous to the people right at the Capitol police there and there's you know there's cameras there but when you're in a restaurant and you think that you know ... where does that stop what am I waiting for somebody outside their home you know I Wonder what Democrats think about that can forty people wait wait outside your apartment in in uh\nOn Capitol Hill and what you know downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate\nAnd and they can they follow you can they probably ever you go\nYou know this whole notion of there in public so they can be a target of our disdain now oh they're in a restaurant I mean I really get angry when I hear every Democrat said things like oh sorry to just you know enjoy their frog legs as they sit there at the table well people are losing their health care of it just is childish talking points stupidity\nYou know you're a lot of the older the ... or you know the roast chicken while the poor people out in America are suffering\n... they they try to create this whole narrative justify their whiny childish ... which is really a very\nCommon and very widespread characteristic of activists Democrats their whiny screaming children\nAnd they act out and they throw tantrums and then they want the media to tell them that those tantrums are okay and the media does an important political figures I mean as much as you think he's got sleep rains are Ryan's represents names important\nSo this is this is the distinction they're not hiding that they're okay with this behavior not only do they do this stuff and we really don't or at least we rarely our side rarely does\nThey celebrate they endorse when their side is engaged in mob tactics and they really hope that the American people forget that\nBefore election day [noise] really interesting study I saw this week about how people ah don't really trust Facebook that much more robust really not surprising is that when you see all of the stories out

confirming that a suspicious package\nNot being able to tell them this is true the Democrats in general they are not able to tell the American people what they really think and what they really believe and maintain their electoral prospects ... they're the ones who always have to play this game\nOn things like immigration which is why that Obama soundbite where he said you know you can't you can't sneak into this country it's not allowed or we're not going to let people just surge into into this place\nSome people as a I think it was ... at the New York times wrote oh I thought Obama was you know we're so are you know so pro illegals it's like yeah he's lying when he says that he wants to secure the border she can't she can't figure it out apparently\nA buddy buddy you see this time and again we're the left is just being dishonest about\nWhat they really want and um you know this this was new you have a MSNBC where the guy blaming the Reagan Administration for they play quid tend please say that they also\nNeed to call out the fair Margaret Traub is normally one other thing I Would add to that when Democrats show that at all\nTo say is that people playing some of these countries are playing some of these countries because of condition created by Republican foreign policy particularly in the Reagan Administration when you have a problem with the images we can go back over time and see why these countries on the condition that there and\nThat's right folks it's American foreign policies fault that Honduras is a a hell of a whole of crime and corruption and violence it's America's fault you see every country anywhere in the world that's in bad shape is somehow are full that's the view of the left\nAnd it also informs their immigration policy don't think that that's just a throw away because the progressive in this country believe that America has only becomes so rich and powerful on the backs of the third world and\nEssentially the non white regions of the globe that is a widespread left wing belief you see it in in uh in academia you see it and media uh this is not unusual at all\nAnd in fact some of the Obama administration approach to foreign policy was also informed by this idea that America is why there was all the ... and the apology toward America has a lot to apologize for\nAnd the dysfunctions in Central America are somehow according to leftists\nThe fault of America and therefore we shouldn't be saying hold on a second ... you know we we can't force the American taxpayers to subsidize all the dysfunction all the problems in Central America that's not fair they say oh no no no you owe that to them\nSee this is a fascinating\nAnd very destructive world view of the left has but it informs the Democratic party's foreign policy and the basics of it are that\nAnything that we have to do when it comes to immigration and one of the weather is taking in refugees are taking in illegals that is going to be exact cost upon the American taxpayer is completely justified\nBecause we ... you see it's our fault that these countries aren't more prosperous are so corrupt um it's it's always our fault and less view and really what it is a globalized victim allergy\nRight that that other countries there people are victims of the United states and therefore the Democrats need to be in charge in this country to make amends for all that\nNew one am that he'll know on downtown drunk deal now again maybe ... feet the dead man's partiers anybody would house Chrysler dodge ... you are in a\nSo we can box office reviewed\nNot
