Fox News President Trump considering ending the policy where children born in the west to parents who are illegal immigrants are automatically us citizens Democrats slamming the plant\nThis amendment which I have offered is simply declare it tore of what I regard as the law of the land already that every person warm and the limits of the United states and subject to their jurisdiction is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United states\nThis will not of course include\nPerson born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states\nBut will include every other class of persons that's right notch\nForeigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents who are green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners\nFor the purposes of this discussion but it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and they were dropping some and it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are in the United states illegally and\nNow this is where we get into some complexity and some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child is this has led to some open it outright scams out the system most notably with the citizenship a or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are run\nAnd there have been all stories on this where in California particularly you have people from East Asia who will fly to California and stay in\nA a specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is that they're when they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to let's say mainland China or whatever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older they already have citizenship\nWell gee that's that's a pretty that's a pretty sweet deal isn't it\nBut citizenship is not supposed to be a commodity that people can just sort of snacks for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it than that and we obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving\nBut all of it as a citizen right oh but this person's a citizen people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation of law and they are a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure\nOverrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people our government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interest of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here\nAnd that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country and other that's all it's unfair but life is unfair and nation states are inherently somewhat arbitrary system\nJust like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yes some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration than those laws in effect ceased to exist\nAnd then you keep working back from this and you'll find yourself\nSaying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here what Democrats really what the Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment says and and they clearly believed that ... and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person to be a citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely that\nLater on that person will be able to sponsor all that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right so if you if you come with say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states\nYou were waiting to find out if you get asylum you have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically\nYou could have family reunification migration ... chain migration to bring interest the family in some oil revenues at one kid in America and you're already at the front of the line when it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child that's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the uh what was it the er I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the center for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth\nOne in five and twenty fourteenth seven hundred and Ninety One thousand\nA birth in the United states were to an immigrant's whether legal or illegal and illegal immigrants counted for seven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty four teams believe that three hundred thousand\nIllegal aliens had children in the United states but\nIt's not just a three hundred thousand or so I remember that's a few years ago it could be even higher now\nIt's a three hundred thousand plus then the likely sponsoring of their entire family reunification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that because once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here illegally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child\nYou know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families so forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family for a for a legal immigration system\nAh forget about that right because now it's you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen citizen Charlotte American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of course you can't be deported\nHence the phenomenon of an anchor baby right it it essentially gaming the system not just for that individual who's obviously getting a benefit\nBy his parents doing something that is a illegal right across the country is clearly it'd be being illegal aliens illegal Democrats may not want to believe that but it is true it is illegal you are in violation of law\nSo they're getting a benefit but then they also get the additional benefit of oh wow if immigrations and Customs Enforcement later tries to deport the parents\nThey're breaking up families Trump says he's gonna handles with an executive order is that the right way I mean probably not from a perspective of separation of powers the constitution there are some\nDecisions although not particularly robust ones that look at the issue of who's a who's a ... a who's a citizen\nSubject the jurisdiction there of and there were some complexities the nineteenth century around this because of Native Americans and whether Native Americans were subject to Native American jurisdiction not not us federal jurisdiction um but the courts have never really weighed in on this in a clear fashion\nSo yes Trump's executive order on this show to get science should he do it will clearly be challenge right away by the never Trump judiciary and quite honestly it'd probably be challenged regardless of whether it was even Trump who did this it's not just this is not a trumped arrangements syndrome limited issue\nBut it will get fast tracked I think to the Supreme Court and then they will have to weigh in on this and then we will find out\nIf in fact the Supreme Court wants to reward people for breaking US law and make sure that there is a clear plan to change the political and demographic realities of the United states through\nContinued loopholes in the immigration system because it benefits Democrats that's we're going to find out and by the way if the Supreme Court rules against this and says that birthright citizenship is no longer or\nRather if you're born in this country or no longer going to be an automatic citizen what does that say about the scan the Democrats have been running with a lot of Republican complicity I might add all this time\nWhat does that say about what's been going on if that if that really isn't a valid interpretation of the fourteenth amendment and of of what's currently on the books in terms of the constitution so we really so the American people really would have been scammed all this time oh it when you look at this we are the outlier there are\nBrought to you by Omaha largest men's testosterone clinics limitless male medical has expanded to Seventy five hundred square feet mixture very live

Andrew Gillum is an example of somebody who I I don't know how you can\nThink he's a good idea of the state of Florida I mean I we played it on this show and the ... election I think is probably going to get more national attention than any other election and this measure\nBut give them the guy with a lot of people focused on obviously is a young telegenic African American and you know so and and the state of Florida politically\nIs a kind of Lynch Penn State for anybody in twenty twenty and that's why you know when you when you look at this and you try and assess\nThe conversation around this race you've got to remember that it's not just even about this it's about how it sets up the the future uh for the Democrat Party\nAnd you know there's going to give them though we've we've talked ... already talked about it before on the show doesn't know how we pay for some of these programs doesn't know how he would uh actually improve health care is really what it comes down to is a lot of these politicians they they talk of the game about how they're going to get more health care to people really ... they're gonna raise\nTaxes and expand Medicaid that's all it's going to be raised taxes expand Medicaid and Medicaid health outcomes are really poor and you're not going to get\nBetter health outcomes just by adding more state dollars thrown into programs you know we we've seen this with schools you can spend a lot of money on schools and have them be bad you can spend a whole lot ... a lot less money all schools and have them be good but the lid answer is always just more money for schools\nThat's more money more money and when you look and pull it apart you actually get into the nuts and bolts of what's happening in our education system which you see is that the money isn't going to the kids it's not even one of the teachers going through these bureaucrats administrators the teaching system\nWhat do you thing happens with the state\nState paid for medical systems a tremendous amount of waste and abuse so I mean Gillum is just a bad idea but you also get a sense he's kind of it's kind of a nasty guy\nUm you know he's very very willing to uh say whatever he thinks he has to say\nAbout the opposition which I guess it's true of all Democrats these days but it probably fourteen\nFat to have the given too much harbor\nA chore racism is enough votes\nSemite he himself when he became the Republican nominee went on Fox News is that to the voters afloat and that's a monkey the state of\nRace has been an issue from the very beginning and this campaign that because I introduced is having my grandmother used to have the same [noise]\nThat because you're both get dirty but he actually like\nDefended the want to do was to drag me into the gutter yeah for\nBecause they can survive getting dirty\nNow let me just take a moment does stand back with you and just admire what what happened there that is a rhetorical technique known as ... better rich CEO is I could talk about how my opponent is a\nComplete moron who would be nowhere without his family money but I'm not going to do that it is doing the thing that you say you will not do\nAs a form of attack and a a predator rich CEO in this case\nIs on full display he says well you know just said is said monkey it up about the state and he's clearly saying just than just as a racist that's what that is but then he but then he immediately switches to bars I don't want to play dirty and wrestle with pigs why won't do that\nOr the the classic cynical technique of politicians and it's right there on display\nFor you from uh from Gillum or who I Would notice that my understanding is Tallahassee has got a lot of problems in the city which is not surprising at all\nBut speaking of the supporters of the left by like this was during a moment of silence for Pittsburgh victims Marsha Blackburn\nThen they pay in this is nonsense\nPeople will say that was like oh they ... they'll they'll they'll be paying taxes to really\n\nA vast majority of of people who are earning what illegal aliens earn are going to over the course of their lifetime take much more and government benefits and they pay in taxes even close so how does this make us wealthier better off as a country by the way we're always hearing about how divided we are as a nation\nOh we're so divided okay how is it supposed to make us less divided to bring people into this country or allow them to come into the country and stay\nWho do not speak the language\nWho do not share our culture\nAnd whose first by definition first act on us soil is to break the law\nThat's going to bring us together that has some\nUnifying effect that are up to this point the most of us have been on aware of that that that strikes me as very strange that strikes me as very unlikely\n\nBut they've been lying to us about this for a long long time there are many many people who have a vested interest\nIn propagating this lie even further and propping up\nOh Schmidt by the way is not is not done with a big fat jokes stupid they stay very still ... keep playing it\nKellyanne Conway despicable early today goes on national television and she said well this shooter's motives were because there's an anti religious sentiment no man\nThe propaganda industry that she commands with a vial president that she serves about it by mark ... event and Rush Limbaugh\nAnd Breitbart News pastors and judicial watch and all the rest of them have blood on their hands for the insight Lance that they have made that have triggered\nAnd radicalized these crazy people it is delivered in in ... he said\nThe letter writer and I don't know if this guy's aggressively aggressively stupid and the fact that he was in charge of the McCain presidential campaign in at any level tells you really all you need to know but why McCain's campaign was due to he also was the one I think the thought that Sarah Palin at the VP was the great a great idea writer who was part of that whole process\nSo but it but to the to the main point here claiming that Breitbart and ... a rash and a little van and others have blood on their hands\nIs just is just a a a smear each just slanderous\nIt has no basis in any reality especially because the first of all really he's he's going to go out he's going to go after ... after ... after an anti Semitic shooting in a synagogue this complete buffoon on MSNBC speaking about propaganda that's out there he's going to go after mark Levin\nWow I mean it showed brazen that there I just can't figure out is she too stupid\nTo know the full scope of what he's saying or is he in fact just that cynical that he doesn't care and that MSNBC put this on their air and allows us to continue by the way I'm sure there were other segments of the right before right after this about how we need to restore civility in our conversation\nAfter they got this guy the guy got blood on time for the thing about the same to\nStage but with the now with the who\nLook marked within doesn't need me to catch his back but I I got to say you know that it's just it's just an outrage somebody was set of them are at war or about rush or any of total outrage by MSNBC is maybe that's why I don't spend as much time on it because MSNBC is almost\nIn terms of stupidity well it's more honest about being a bunch of left is it's really beneath contempt\nUh it it really is that a level where it's not worth analyzing it because you only watch that if you really believe that history does not matter that capitalism is not a good thing that a math is not an essential elements of good policy may have got it ... that's the only way you can watch MSNBC\nAnd that everybody should climate there are a victim and just fight over who's a bigger victim and that that's a recipe for healthy society that's the basis of the MSNBC watchers mind\nMan\nIs it has been rough watching all these people just make complete in Brussels with themselves just\nOutrageous stuff and then turn around and want to be taken seriously and other things oh wait wait since we're talking about the dumbest people on TV it let's just throw in one one more\nOne more out there who is a quote conservative or you know it was coming the laughs favorite all I Do is jump on the right person that is allegedly\nOn the right Jennifer Rubin who you know I I just before we before we get to her her little part of this\nOne of my favorite things that I have a reading in a long time was my friend Charles Cooke who's a brilliant writer at all I Wish we saw and heard more from Charles these days I think he's just enjoying life in Florida but\nI've always really liked Charles and thought he was very talented or but Charles did this piece that was comparing what Jennifer Rubin writes one year and then write the next year and it's like a person with schizophrenia fighting with herself in writing all the time\nLike this is a really good idea it was just terrible for Israel this is a really good bigger concern for conservative\nOr there's no consistency your principal whatsoever but you're Ruben sure enough he's an opening to trash Trump ready Semitism she's taken to play Fifteen\n... present the entire country he does not believe that people respond to a good thing he got out there talking about his tax plan it out there talking about these great trade deal he got down the line take out there and leading the bloody shirt and that's what he does All right\nI think it's that I I you know what guys we hit

lifestyle change and we're on nutrition activity and lifestyle company people talk about weight loss and diet all the time and we really have an understanding that\nWeight loss is a very difficult thing and it stems from places sell most of our clients come from doctors for friends and family and so you know anybody can sell a product we are not a product company we're short term lifestyle for people where the lifestyle of our program I should say\nWe don't want people to be coming back to us year after year after year we help them get the weight off really folks on lifestyle change behavior change and and they become self sustainable so\nThe first phase is is really focused on weight loss behavior change non scale victory so we understand\nThat everything's about weight but victories in life whether it's new size of pants or you know chasing after grandkids [noise]\nThings like that second phase again behavior change still focusing on that but we focus more on nutrition label reading how to differentiate who's out in the market and and helping people become self sustainable so drawing back some of those things that were in before and introducing new foods and then the sustain these people are on their own they still have their coach to come back\nAnd visit with but they really learned that healthy lifestyle and and how to live on their own without being reliable I'm profile just got to be pretty rewarding work we always go back to the number of people attribute us first saving their lives are saving their marriage or what whatever that maybe\nWe're really just providing the platform were there for the coaching it's really on our members to take it upon themselves to to make that change and go through that journey and change their life\nAnd that's another CEO use you know thing for me you know hard I mean I'll give me your name and thank you for listening to this diehard Omaha radio station [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n... you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw\nSome getting twenty five and thirty thousand people to these rallies nobody's ever seen it still has never been at this isn't bragging that has never been anything like what's happening I went to Illinois ... bowling seven forty ... this massive hangar pack and they had to use a second\nBang for the overflow nobody seen in now and always look what happened to Ted Cruz is doing great now\nWe let loose and he's not doing great\nThat's right it's not bragging as you tell it like it is Margot delicious all over the place how's it looking for the midterms is the Trump effect is going to carry the day is the cabinet wave still assessing answering these questions and more we have with us now Betty Johnson reporter at the Daily Caller Mr Johnson great to have you back\nPay but thank you so much for having yeah\nSo do you think that they're going to be a lot of lives eating Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream are on election night in order to just do the all the hurt and and deal with all the tears or they go in the house or how we look at right now\nYes Ben and Jerry's ice cream actually comes with a warning label on the fact that it does taste better\nIf you're crying liberal cheers into it and you mix it up and the extra salty and the extra weight it goes together beautifully\nThat's good and I think they're going to be a lot of that election night but there are trending\nPolls word for Republicans nationwide you have a lot of races are particularly after the cabin on the cabin off that you mentioned earlier\nLot of races that were tossed up a winning right a lot of races that were steady down to a lot of races that Republicans and Democrats seem to be able to cling onto a see that one um massively in the ... as\nWe used over tightening you extra races like Tennessee races I'm like a good story but it really is trying to get off work for the ...\nYou think that the Ted Cruz is going to from an electoral perspective kicked the skateboard out from under ... and tell them that there'll be heavy stuff so loud\n[laughter] there's actually a viral clip from Ted Cruz yesterday Republican on the Daily Caller\nOr where he where he told or where he told a reporter who asked about Texas getting their first let's you know senator\nOr what is there a shortage is there a shortage of Irish men in the U.S Senate because ... horses are actually Robert Francis ... years very very Irish Ted Cruz's with\nQueen ... and married to a billionaire by the way how does that not really ever get reported until now I've been reading about this guy for months I just found out that he's married to a billionaire family and tends to what his own financial interests are at stake side with the plutocrats over the people but he was shocked about ...\nWhat a shock I mean you got to come up how quick but kept the\nI didn't know if you do to count like count Dracula thing there that was Bernie at first I'm Glad we figured out it was it was ... but I Do feel like\nI Do feel like Bernie or rather bait Joe uh got got kind of a pass for being incredibly wealthy himself every time I see this guy he's got\nThe rolled up sleeves and he's been described as Kennedy yet and I'm like oh so he's a silver spoon her who's running around with a nickname for the culture that has not his own okay that's interesting\n[noise] yeah well correct at least as these on a skateboard there's less of a chance for him to hit someone while drunk driving in a vehicle and actually hurt them\nAnd then he could still flee the scene on a skateboard my friend don't think that's not possible\n[laughter] either way whatever happens whatever the cops but in the police report it was alive remember that but it was a lie there\nYou go to ... always lie about things like that so do you have any races that you're looking at a that you think are\nWhere we're you're expecting Republican to over perform expectations up to this point or you know who do you really let me at best question for your ... who do you really care about seeing get the W. on election night was only a few days away but I mean who is you get W used by their names are you going to say\nIt's a good day for freedom a good day for America\nRight so you have a of course you have Ted Cruz versus beta now what that is is just position reporting twenty that was the candidate\nA liberal journalist right now are writing the beta la Brea actually one shout out to the journalist right now that are that are already have that piece prepared because they do is down by double digits in Texas\nOr this isn't going to happen for him also the president of course is who is lost her campaign or an Israeli actually moving the needle\nFor me to comment on poetic trial to pull have followed everywhere\nHe has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful meant that\nThe president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence\nDirectly I got the same so how do you marry this situation with the president last week for national thought he had to do is say white nationalist to that he does have to take some responsibility for the pipe for writing this bio climate that we find ourselves answer\nPresence opposite race is obviously a demagogue condos anytime 'cause I'm a stokes up nationalist hey this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person and what they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to\nChange any of our tactics do not try to convince us they are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement they're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail\nWhy would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to want to get this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really\nA ... you know state\nPaid for health care and state paid for college which means you ... question of how much it who\nAnd then let the mayhem of the bureaucracy\nAh get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution of care and everything else but did you you're not even hearing and make a real picture about any of this ... this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election\nWar they were anticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric\nAnd all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans are they're so terrible on a show of all that stuff\nThey really thought that that would be enough to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that they're actually making the case because there's only some people were going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat\nWearing Trump early stage true believer many of whom listen to the show and high five to all of you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class had no idea what's happening until basically at at at already occurred on election day\nRight so you guys saw Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not\nBut you're obviously not going to change your mind based on what they said no matter what no matter what right I mean 'cause you see the result\nBut I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election and a few days right we're we're a week away from finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house that has profound implications for certainly the next two years I'm not I'm not the most important election of our lifetime that is not true okay\nThat'd be ... and his top what that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election\nWould probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty sixteen so twenty twenty will probably be the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this mid term shakes out\nAnd that's why I just think it's so noticeable but Democrats aren't even at the at the national level and they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues it's like the Joe Manchin effect\nHow is Joe Manchin even a Democrat 'cause he likes to unions I you know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common was on the left or people that are\nPretending to be a more centrist then they will vote she's actually fool the voters\nAnd then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that the more common tactic that's much more likely to be\nA what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media markets stuff about how protecting protecting preexisting conditions on Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout from a left his trumpet Trump is a racist he's terrible\nAnd you know they're just they're never going to stop\nSo that's why whenever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would if only trouble one what stopped being Trump and you'll like him this is nonsense waste are based on oh I mentioned twenty twenty and how do the second most important election of of my lifetime uh I like the trumpet it say about this last night and Laura Ingraham show a place that\nSo far I like 'em all\nI don't see anybody right now and I should shut\nAll I could to let me very happy with Hillary I like 'em all [laughter] I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against\nYou know the truth is that is the truth is nobody right now that Trump looks at\nAcross the aisle thinks oh wow I don't know if I could ... I think that person might have the you know the magic formula to beat me oh wow you know I don't know\nThere's nobody there was nobody that's even close I the only one who you think maybe as enough of a wild card that it'll be interesting is Bernie Sanders and I think what people figure out more about the more people know about Bernie Sanders policies at the national level the less they are going to like him but that's a pretty big vulnerability\nBertie goes do you talk to me ... but when you find out you're gonna have to pay Seventy percent of your income in taxes I I don't think you're going to want to feel the burn quite the way he does\n[noise] security breaches happen all the time now you made me think you know it usually is a big company and who knows if the bad guys of the actors will ever get my information well let me tell you something if you ever use public why for I guess what\nWhatever you're doing anything on your computer you're being cracked and your private information therefore can be put at risk you can also be sold and use the ways you don't want it to you that's why you won a virtual private network and express VPN is simply the best one you can get\nExpressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seems to be in the background of\nMy computer phones and tablets and turning on a ... protection is so simple it costs less than seven dollars a month you can do with one click\nI Know about all my security I'm telling you express VPN is what you need to protect your online activity today and find out you can get three months free and express VPN dot com slash box\nThat expressed VPN dot com slash book for three months free with a one year package [noise]\nEverything you do online is track and there's a tremendous amount of information that people can get from whatever it is that you're doing on your computer or your tablet or your smartphone and once the bad guys get their hands on that oh man you're in for a world of hurt I Know about\nProtecting your information security and good ... and that's why I use express vps expressed BBN's virtual private network with that means is that you just use expressed VPN or you don't have to worry about people getting all your private information\nAnd selling it and using it expressed VPN protects you run in the background or by Computer Fraud and tablet cost less than seven dollars a month to have you ever used public walk by and you want to keep hackers inspired from seeing your stuff expressed be the end of the solution to protect\nYour online activity today and find out how you get three months brief and express VPN dot com slash book that's express VPN dot com slash book for three months free with a one year ...
