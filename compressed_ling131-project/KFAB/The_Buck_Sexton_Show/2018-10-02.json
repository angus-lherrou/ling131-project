Dr Wendy Patrick both were the ... the shining and when a ... to book was scary Stephen King book but when Jack Nicholson took on that role\n[laughter]\nOh and or the late scat man Caruthers was all of them were great great film All right that's a scary one I'd give you that one all work and no play makes jak Dell boy [laughter]\nOkay well thanks I won't sleep\nOkay well thanks to it again I

rubble he ever did that was that was really a great role for him\nYou know uh we were just talking about this or a group of us were sitting around talking about the great\nAmerican actors of our time and I said Nicholson to me is under appreciated even though he's award winning but we haven't heard from Jack in a while and I'm nervous that he's not well you know there was talk while ago that he was not that he was having a\nBrain issue so I I've not heard or seen Jack Nicholson in so long I Want\nI I think Kavanaugh has been put a position that he is guilty until proven innocent yeah just of its upside down this point I think it's just a nightmare what's happening to him because after him it's just gonna keep rolling down the line\nWell that the the clarion call that was sounded by a Lindsey Graham last week and I thought Lindsey Graham's a statement that was a warning to Democrats should have been a warning to both sides because\nThis is nothing but the the policy of payback which is what we used to seeing the house and now we're seeing in the Senate and the Senate was always supposed to be the cooling saucer is you know you've heard that expression before\nBut this this catch me really ticked off because you did buck explained my theory I think I ran it by him I don't know if he shared with you I Believe all of this all of this bad behavior is blame squarely\nOn Harry Reid and I I don't know if anybody brought that up weighed but follow me on this Harry Reid in literature\nThat from ... but I Do listen regular okay\nAll right Harry Reid made the move\nTo get rid of the filibuster in the Senate to to get it so you didn't have sixty votes in the here's where it became a problem we remove that that a hindrance to getting a judge threw are getting anything done in the Senate without sixty votes\nAnd then it was weaponized by Mitch McConnell\nA couple of years later\nBut see if if you have a filibuster and I know a lot of my friends are going to say Mike you're you're wrong and that if you have a filibuster you're going to have candidates nominated who have to have an automatic appeal across the aisle\nNow to people who just won a conservative court or a liberal court that doesn't make sense\nThey say no no no you know elections have consequences you shouldn't have all the power you want well this is where we end up [noise] we we end up with this situation where now we're tearing each other apart and we're tearing apart are really good man\nAnd I see someone who would say\nAny comment last you know anybody new coming in and wouldn't last that

film so uh I think you would enjoy it [laughter]\nAs I was only on my list because I saw it as a child but I guess my real one is a\nFantastic good ones I Believe I yeah it's one where they started to have a little more special facts involved in movies but I I still go for the the kind of raw naked fear that we saw in a night of the living dead but that's what makes up\nA\nLot of good good well I appreciate you joining the conversation thanks for listening to a buck and and let's hold forth we've got a just what was it six weeks left before the midterms way of work to do we have to make sure everybody we know it\nGets out and boats are checking in I have time it gets to check in with John in Delaware has a thought about a scary movie and Chuck Schumer John welcome to the program\nAnd Mike welcome back to Delaware you always seem to be in Delaware and when I'm listening to you like that\nWell I live in Delaware\nOh do ya okay great man okay cool anywhere near Dover ... northern Delaware\nAh yeah yeah up in ah Newcastle county and I mentioned it earlier uh I enjoy time on the Delaware Bay when I can but yeah my wife and I lived\nIn Delaware and the ... you live in lower slower Delaware where people have their brains and they're still conservative so I'm up in the blue part of who say\nThat but once you get down into the robots area it starts turning a little bit below again\nYeah it ... ... but there's a little too close for people that don't know welcome to Delaware beach talk or the Delaware a little too close to Maryland and it gets it suffers from some of that Maryland a liberalism\nYou got that right man well I Want to say that that that my top scary movie of all time personally I Would have to go with the shining with Jack Nicholson\nThere's a lot at the shining is currently leading in all voting and its\nThe it's a great movie behind\nYou guys I I just now started the show believe it or not um on AM radio and and the ... show just started about ... minutes to go round that\nOh cool well in our\nOwn you guys so I'm just now catching I thought the show just started ... and\nKnow the first hour the shining was the leading vote getter despite my constant lobbying to have neither the living dead get the props that it deserves from fifty years of scaring the heck out of people but the shining is classic\nIt it well the shining it's such a ... very well directed movie and uh my only complaint with the shiny\nWe thought that Nicholson's character was weird from the very beginning and I think in order to have a real tragic characters shift you have to like the guy first he was weird for me to you\nDid actually he came off a little bit scary or maybe a little bit psychologically stable and it's set in my correct\nYeah yeah so ... here we are ... on a great political talk show we're analyzing scary movies but uh I'd ask John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer because I'm no fan of humor he was my senator for twenty plus years\nI just wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big out and he always said the Robin Hood saw no wearing what he said today that the judge dairy said that he was you know deeply deeply part is saying and this is a cat or didn't notice judge from a carrot eight\nChuck Schumer has got a big mouth and if we don't get our little boat and we don't you know get out there for the midterms in ... right\nAnd keep things the way if not better Schumer is going to be the big boss hog up there and we're going to have you here is now for the next God only knows our long I Can't stand it\nWell the only thing worse than Schumer would be Schumer and Pelosi so these are my\nThat's another one like you hit the nail on the head\nYeah these are two very scary realities people and we have to make sure that you take someone to the polls because the Democrats are mobilizing in ways that you have no idea\nAnd despite the fact that the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the obvious uh the way this was organized to destroy the man and all this nomination it is disgusting I'll get into some of that and I still didn't get to my network proclamation my my liberal network proclamation I Will get to it I promise\nPlus I Want to hear from you guys on your scariest movies are just around the corner and a little bit a doctor Gorka is joining us Sebastian Gorka will be
