vote Democrat\nBecause they know that\nImmigrants particularly the ... people well [laughter] illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for them but who really knows what's happening there uh but but immigrants in general\nUh tend to vote Democrat and people who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of the government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stopped we can't keep doing this the answers to it it's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up this problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey\nWe understand is very difficult

I guess we should just taken everyone and everybody everybody who has been waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process and it was respected our laws\nAre many people who are still waiting to get into this country and whoever respected our laws along I I guess they're just jumps they don't have\nAnd MSNBC CNN New York times Washington Post in their corner so they don't count\nThis is very very destructive and it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here and under what circumstances than it is just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a policy we will be a different country different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes\nYou cannot have open borders in a welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows says no other country in the world takes in a million people and makes the legal and God Bless them welcome to America legal citizens year in and you're at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nA lot\nEvery year working in a million for a legal process and when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand all my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster\nWell hold on a second we're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing can a number only go in one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything and if we have Trump even in office for if we're lucky the next six years\nTo try and stem the tide of recurrent migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\nDemocrats don't want to do because Wal\nFirst off would prove its utility very quickly and then they all look foolish or walls don't work no I'm pretty sure walls work\nYou know if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property and has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking onto their property in trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they say oh walls don't work and works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works\nSo why wouldn't workouts where all they don't have any good answers for you they just don't want it to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on look he has an unfulfilled promise now as to who's behind this march\nAnd who's\nThe strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I don't know\nBut I Do know that this is not a coincidence\nThat you have the largest of these migrants caravans that I that I Know of just a couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border this allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about that\nFact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their predictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things that they've said the twenty Fifth Amendment he has to be removed 'cause he's crazy Russia collusion the mainstream media has wasted over a year of the American people's time\nOn this fantasy\nThat Trump colluded with Russia\nWorse than a fantasy minute it's a plot it's a plot that was put into motion by anti Trump elements in our own government undermined the press the United states which did a year of our time on this year and a half of our time\nIt's insane is absolutely insane but\nThey can get enough people at the border looking sad and looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and talking about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books from your mom and they just ration about how for the safety of all involved and also yes as a deterrent\nYou separate people from their children at the border you should reunite them but this is the process that they have had and if they do this again I Know the Trump administration's change the way that they're going to do it because he outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours\nWe're going to be told it's heartless it's cruel it's you know it's evil it's a it's a Nazi concentration camps all over again I'm not making that up people were saying that about this\nPeople that we're still supposed to take seriously in public discourse which is\nIn itself just ...\nWe are in a fight my friends and we need to

mean in terms of candidates in terms of a bench\n\nKamala Harris I see here is is thinking about uh giving American families you know five hundred dollars a month you're going to hear more about I think universal basic income I think they're actually trying it now in a a trying it in a city in California right they're pushing for it out there\nThey have no new ideas they have nothing to tell people about that can get them excited all the news get people angry by telling them how terrible and awful or the Republicans are I think there are also in a bit of shock\nAnd this is where I'll talk to you a somewhat about the the Kavanaugh effect\nWhich is very very real these senators\nWho are leading the charge against Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate may have in fact caused the Republicans to gain seats I think you'll see\nFifty four fifty five GOP seats by the end of the election in the Senate and they were going to go to fifty four fifty five\nAh which is not a huge increase but in in a midterm election years pretty darned good I Know the fact that the house has even play historically that's just such an aberration the fact the house is a serious contests now is because not only did we see what was done to Brett Kavanaugh but also there was\nFor all to see\nSenator after senator with de next to their name\nActing in a way that was just grotesque the worst of American politics on display people solve is they took note I Believe that Schumer might leave might lose his job over this one I think that Schumer or is going to have to be replaced\nA set of minority leader over what happened it was a ... ... it was a debacle and they know it\nThat's why they don't talk about it anymore that's why there's so many fewer senators out there who are talking about this issue if they are to close\nTheir clothes or rather the state where there's a close race going on right people are not discussing Feinstein\nFor she's California She's saying whatever Feinstein has said that she wants to reopen the investigation into Kavanaugh well I think that everybody out there I Know this was said last night on Fox everybody out there who's running every\nEvery Democrat should be asked do you support\nReopening the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh that should be a question that that press ask them because it is being put out there by powerful numbers the Democratic party\nHas its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that should be the guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know at a but beyond that\nThere's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the last couple of weeks last few weeks that could change this election much how you got it right now\nAnd in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell you I had a I had a chat with Lindsey Graham last night\nSpoken for about twenty minutes we sort of sat down we're over Fox and I was I was up Lindsey we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on here is the bottom line the Kavanaugh effect is very real\nLindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh but here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game 'cause you know Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather [noise] uh the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging and healthcare help your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling shows that that actually for the people were going to vote\nThat matters to them Republicans do have had a gift recently and what you see is that the\nCabin all effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat\nOh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake is that's not gonna fly that's not going to work\n[noise] um the dynamic of this playing out right now is the uh the\nDynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think it's really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the needy because they're ... they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in a elections that are in states where it's kind of a ... a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a of a\nClose circle all across the board they want people to come and speak about the cabin on issue\nWhat Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nSo in very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls writes great but in states where it's a closer call or it's a little more purple where there you're\nThe Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did a Kavanaugh you can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any any more authority and they're already have all the wives the American people and Kevin all could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought that they would stop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop it just huge a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is dating anticipate that in a lot of\nClose fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women are scary is about what happened to capping off furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist you already\nAnd I voted you hate Trump doesn't matter what if somebody was like well you know sometimes\nI'm a little bit you know ... with some of what Trump has drawn but you're you're a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future of this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely fired up about this and that could be the game change\nIt could be the enthusiasm among center right wing in suburban districts that makes this house contract it's going to be down to the water\nDishes going to be really close Arctic could she'll go the Republicans would I Would feel like a miracle but it could still happen\nAnd\nIt's going to be because of Kavanaugh so folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh critic [noise]\nI've got

Turkish ditch Turkish sovereignty or I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already be an investigation\nThat is highly sensitive and I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get it how we get it\nBut if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were brought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak vice president Pence\nHowever is saying that there will be consequences political ten oh I can assure you\n\nIn some\n'em [laughter]\n\n[noise] what has been\nLie and\nThere will be consequences the vice president says noticed that people are pretty pretty thin on details of what those consequences would be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response\nWhich would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here and what would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia\nTruth is we don't want to major break with the Saudis um the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in\nThat countrymen representation in Saudi Arabia for doing just remember what happened with the Arab Spring\nWith at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women are going to school at all these ... which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean and it's going to be a really\nBig step forward and then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power let me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and I would\nOffer to you probably much more hard line is less than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach in Saudi Arabia right now only do show with the acceptance and the and the ... of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of\nElation ship with them is because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenarios of the government is overthrown and either of those places in Pakistan\nBecause you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary uh in Saudi Arabia we have very few powerful military allies left in the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then\nIt starts to get pretty thin Jordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not a strictly wealthier powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam eyes and they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East\nSaudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there Egypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems are and you look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping to place doesn't collapse into some kind of ethnic\nCivil war and you got it wrong clearly is not perfectly fine to the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government because it would be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say\nWe want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be a sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh getting shifted around a one way or another getting stop or whatever they they end up doing\nThis these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them that Chinese people are the loudest voices on this\nDo not have America's interest necessarily at heart they view this as an opportunity\nTo both criticized and antagonize the Trump Administration that's right as I've been telling you this is supposed to really just turned ... turn into a means of getting at Trump and saying that no matter what happens it's his fault will get into that in a moment\nOr other social media is full of lots and lots of different ways that they can make you disappear they'll tell you that it's just because of a violation

B. a seal you ask for a miracle I bring you the F. B. or to get that one but not really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and well I think it's because he knows that the hash\nTag resistance and Trump does is to just not worth getting rid of him the Aztec resistance would call them politically and utterly freak out if in fact there was a a ... a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care he got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein to step down at a ... a deputy attorney general\nBecause lawmakers are looking into reports about how rose aside once talked about wearing a wire drew record President Trump you know I really do believe that if when I was a little a little a little nobody CIA analyst if I had said that I was going to wear a wire to try and and trap just even the CIA director\nI I think I Would have been scored it out of the building by secured by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I said that in a meeting in front of people\nBut for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're like buck two weeks ago he said he was kidding yeah but I thought about\nDon't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard but you know Rosenstein or has he look he's an Obama administration\nHold over and he's clearly very tight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself\nBut that's why Mark Meadows is finally had enough here's with Fox News reports about meadows of the Freedom Caucus he says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down\nAs James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau meadows criticize Rosenstein for not accepting ... testified before the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reported comments\n[noise] you know roses ... there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and say whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because getting rid of them might feel kind of messy\nAnd that's not the only deep states kind of a deep state updates the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nThis treasury employee\nWho is charged with leaking financial fence and reports on Trump team people\nShe was apparently arrested where they flash drive in hand here's a quote from Fox the top Treasury Department employee was charged with leaking confidential financial documents pertaining to former Trump officials was apprehended the previous even with a flash drive in Tennessee allegedly ... information in her hand\nOh my gosh caught\nRed handed or flash handed when last week this week but the dramatic arrest late late Tuesday came on the heels of other high profile leak related prosecutions on the administration which has pledged to go on the offensive against leakers the presidents have called traders and cowards\nAre so this is now the Mayflower Edwards who is a senior official at the financial crimes enforcement network she gave a reporter bank reports allegedly documenting several suspicious financial transactions\nThis is so dirty as as I've been telling you I really want you understand this isn't leaking information that is necessarily accurate or even meaningful this is leaking rumors in a sense that the federal government has on hand that they can look into\nBut a suspicious financial transaction does not mean anything\nDoes not mean anything she also by the way released information about Paul Manafort ah Richard Gates Maria Butina\nHow much more of this do we have to see before we realized that this was all a manufactured narrative from the ... da to the uh General Flynn lying about the ambassador conversation there were a government employees that had a collective nervous breakdown\nAnd then took it upon themselves to just be disgusting little hash tag resistance fighters inside the flabby folds of the bureaucracy\nAnd take action to take down Trump and his people you don't see this happening on the other side you don't see this and the other direction\nSo more details you're on the senior financial a senior government financial official in what she did Edwards have thousands of these suspicious activity reports\nAlong with thousands of other files containing sensitive government information to a government provided flash drive she transmitted into the reporter by taking photos of them and taxing the photographs using an encrypted application according to charging documents which said Edwards eventually confessed to doing so\nFBI agents obtain a pen register and trap and trace order for Edward's cell phone during the investigation\nOh my gosh you know you you had this sea of this woman who ... who provided all this suspicious\nFinancial information are no no no no nothing clear here about anything that Trump did that's wrong but she provided all this information to reporters on Trump people tried to take them down very illegal\nTo do this very destructive to do this you also had reality winner remember her she got I don't know five years in prison something like that she leaked information having to with Russia and the information didn't prove anything it was really just trying to make another\nWho is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Wal Mart and\nI was gonna say Sears [noise] All right piece years all righty but these are very different views of what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul uh let me let me be able to Ron Paul suffers that was from an interview we did on rising by the way we're going to speak to for Congressman Paul\n[noise] ah [noise] he's right Ron Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct or there is\nA very clear history of currency in a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity\nIs very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now that\nSaid Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not found a way too much debt and all that she can be right put on what time line [noise]\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't want to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it's fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the the basic financial challenges that we all have ride telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I don't I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nTo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of right and you thousand eight we came up on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I just put his I\nPut his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and especially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our debt\nWe got to remember that\nWe're we're heading into we're heading to a bad place might not be two years from now might be twenty but we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political will\nYou know look this is I go home and I'm like you know what\nI I really wish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories a calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut when I get home\nThat's the thing they exist or\nYou know deciding to just eat half of wheel of three that's fun right now and when you're dealing with long term projection sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good\nWhen did you live in long term projections and the economy does that sound will to fancy rags debris debris delicious you are just fantastic uh I also like American cheese on American cheese burger yesterday was delicious [noise] ah [noise]\nNobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that has to think strategically about is you want to deal with your immediate\nNeeds answer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action it just means we need to be aware that the action is not going to come quickly and we should balance out what are\nWhat what what risks are acceptable what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy to our children and grandchildren's economies are and then you Gary Cohn with tariffs on China I I really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given them a lot of credit on the ... issue\nAnd um\nI've been willing to say that I ... I Know what the I Know what the argument is against terrorists and I know that the the smart set is almost always an entirely posted terms Trump has taken a different approach and\nI think he has earned the right to try and play it out however he can that said I Do have some concerns about where this is where this is going up the economy it's been a choppy few weeks and people that saw ... people have seen some stuff that's going on right now and the economy and that's that's\nWhen you got to start really thinking about what's what's happening next because I'm telling you the Democrats easiest path to power is\nA recession where they turn all this raises a creator on the left and they mobilize it and they're going to mobilize it in the direction\nOf socialist that's what they're going to do that is what is coming [noise] ah so\nBy the way I really do recommend you all checkout buck event dot com it's a a project I'm working all the stands for research because I'll go where the market is going that different from the overall economy but if you want to know where the stock market is going buck invent dot com smartest guys I've ever met when it comes to the market and we're doing a big event on October\nTwenty four totally free Bucky event dot com sign up check it out you'll see I'll be hosting with some other experts I'm just a host like a game show host but they're the guys are actually spending all we know what I mean it'll be a lot of fun to do check that out but I I'm going to keep watching the economy and see what's happening I just hope things stay steady until election day [noise] I just\nSaw the c._e._o. of mobile verification network earlier this week we caught up in the swamp here in DC and I said you know how's business going how's your growing so rapidly and getting so many new clients on board he said well simply put buck we're all about\nMaking sure that people's data is secure that they get fast answers and that they know the all the work is being done here the United states by trained professionals that what you get when it comes to a background investigations and vetting with global verification network\nAlso whenever you call them you'll get a person who answers your call and answers your questions right away\nCalled eight seven seven six nine five one one seven nine eight seven seven six nine five one one seven I jumped ... cents you this is a veteran owned and operated company my friends you can also go to my GV and dot com that's\nMy GV N. dot com for all background investigations whatever size you were company whatever size we're business might\nAgree Wilson executive director of Catholic charities Catholic charities we serve more than Seventy five thousand people per year with a full suite of program services including adoption to area food pantries in so much more who does the Omaha dot org to donate today we can't do it without you\nThursday I remember a team what is the day on the free I radiolab\nThirteen Days Phil Halloween time to focus in on the Gary fine and get into the ... with the heart radio original vision mellowing radio commercial pre Halloween hit that are both of mine in the area [laughter] both picked that perfect Halloween costume by your candy\nPerfect down to help me with all those activities we\nRadio Manohar radio\nAnd Geraldine my first uh forty W. i.s my blood alcohol level is point by poor but I still had twenty more years the drinking for the first time and forty one years I have hope all because the pain challenger\nNearer needed vehicle and do go to the MIT dot org\nMonsoon weather in ... ...\nLocal [noise] trying to stop\n...
