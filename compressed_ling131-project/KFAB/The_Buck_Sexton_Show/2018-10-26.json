Fox News federal and local authorities zeroing in on one state as they hunt for the person or persons responsible for ten suspected bombs into high profile Democrats and other investigators\nBureaucratic nightmare of an investigation going on merely to target their political enemies that's the whole purpose of it\nThey now have mobs in the streets mobs on the Supreme Court steps mobs on Capitol Hill me in the halls of Congress\nThey pretend that they're not mobs\nAnd then when there was finally the first time that they think they have an opening a whack a finger at the other side over incivility which remember it wouldn't\nBe the instability of a mob it wouldn't be the instability of an entire movement it would just be maybe\nOne wacko\nWho is standing what increasingly looks like yard bombs do very very prominent Democrats and leftists and they want to lecture all of us and they claim that they're not do it which just goes to show you\nHow much gas lighting goes on and our conversations with the left I I Will give you examples of as we will spend a bit of our time this hour working through just how dishonest the left is being with all this\nJust how delusional they really are but I did want to spend\nThem all with you first on what we what we now know about uh about these bombs\nIn fact I could have and it's just hear from the attorney general my buddy Jeff Sessions with a please\nThis department is responding to the suspicious packages that have been sent\nTo several political leaders and a media outlet and then ask last few days yesterday I spoke with FBI Director Chris Wray and\nAnd deputy director they found it and we met with in brief the president to bring him up today FBI ATF are working on this or profit ministry ration weaken damn the actions that led onto a these acts these activities and the strongest possible terms on terms\nInto determined to make sure that we get to the bottom of it injustices done\nThey will find who is responsible for this I'm very confident of that I don't know how quickly though and I don't know if it will be in time for us to make a\nFully informed decision us being the American people you and I already know this doesn't if it doesn't affect my vote doesn't affect my feeling about\nFor the Republican Party or anything else that has nothing to do all the safety threat\nThis is one very very stupid and ah and agree just an evil jerk\nI wanted to use another word but we're on radio um who is going to spend the rest of his life in prison it's just a question of how soon we put him through that process\nBut the ... bombs that have been found so far ... could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances\nThere was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia but they talked\nAbout how the bombs that haven't gone off it kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the YPG is going to have to say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment that the largest police department the country's as no these are these are ... and then the next\nSuspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar person opens it up and goes well I Know what to do it and then we have a tragedy someone loses limbs site\nMaybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs or it might be they can't take that risk not yet I Can't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think that is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to go there\nBut then again I actually professionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it and in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what is and is not real when it comes to terrorism or they have tended to get\nBuck slapped rather hard here's what I see if you were trying to come up with a means to change the entire national conversation away from Kavanaugh which\nWas toxic for Democrats in red states and Democrats in states where Democrats were struggling the Kavanaugh debacle self inflicted wound was toxic\nAnd the caravan making its way up through Mexico the far left activists when the Democratic party loves this story um but the people in places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who are figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea\nThat the Democrat Party is effectively an open borders party privileges certain people from certain places\nOf the world getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electoral prospects they don't like that and so if you wanted to switch that\nNarrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here now is in fact possible\nSome would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible problem this is one\nIncredibly stupid reckless and a ... and really for doing whatever side he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears a mock a hat and and loves Trump's so much they thought that the way to\nThe way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes\nThreatened people terrified people and and the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely that's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever am I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that if this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the timing\nIf the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging to the Democrats and in the process make the anti Trump media seem sympathetic\nAnd give them something to talk about that might sway some moderate to their side just in time the election\nWould this be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy I'm not saying it happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false black answers obviously yes\nSo that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I I refuse to take the position that well because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United\nStates for this that's where I think\nWe have to draw a very hard and fast line the Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly they have created this vicious toxic political environment they have\nNever thought for one moment there was anything decent are acceptable about Trump they wanted to remove him from office I even had an author on impeachment on my on my TV show or in the week who said yes this is the first time ever that there's been impeachment talk for a president who had not even been sworn in\nThey have a mass delusion problem they're having a collective nervous breakdown in slow motion over Trump and his movement and that's why things have become so tense and so nasty and so vicious\nSo would one individual change that dynamic you know\nWe will hold our final conclusions until we have more evidence but in the meantime I'm leaving open all reasonable options\nAnd some that the Democrats want to shut down or a long way from deserving that got a jam packed\nShowed about ... it's not just the bombs that I by the way so uh I I Want you to

obviously not for the the bomb making or or or the recipients of but does he bear responsibility for the tone that allowed it sure\nSure he does and that's part of the reason why I never endorse them and I've never been personally critical of him about it yeah it does bear responsibility for the divisions are as the biggest megaphone\nTrump they say is not responsible for the bombs but he is responsible for the mom\nThat's the formulation that you get here from the ... that's really what they're saying oh I'm In I'm not going to tell you that the reason this happened just Trump I'm just

violence meaning you should be violent against people or if you're a violent acts you should do\nThen he would be guilty of inciting violence I Know there's the problem with lead you have to talk to them like their first graders shorter some of the first graders listening 'cause you're smarter than lives but that's what you have to do you have to walk them through this\nNone other than a Mr fake tapper himself\nCNN Today tweeted out that in response to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that the first thing the media did was blamed Trump he said that's not the first thing\nWe evacuated CNN which is true in terrible on CNN should not have had to be evacuated because nobody should have ever threaten them and that's an awful thing but then he went on to say no one blames Trump not one person than CNN\n[noise] uh no that's not true and I know which half or would you 'cause he likes this game he'd say no one blame Trump for the bombs oh okay that's right no one thinks that Trump was in the west wing\nPutting together these bombs with his bare hands or whatever okay we're in the east wing no one thinks that\nWhat's happening but they're all saying including the president of the CNN network\nThat the environment around all of this is Trump's creation from fault and the environment led to the bombing so in essence from does have responsibility for that is what they're saying and that's exactly what Mika Brzezinski ... because I think her audience at the end at the MSNBC\nDemands it you know the intellectual honesty be damned they simply do not care\nIt does not matter to them that what they're doing is indefensible that it is wrong on so many levels to talk about divisions in this country as though there are a bad thing and then two in the next breath maybe even in the next sentence maybe even in the same sentence\nYou know we we have a significant commitment to the military on recently were very broad we won the freedom award which was the single biggest award than

people absolutely have the choice to make a on what they believe in\nAnd it couldn't be clearer and we're going to see that happen and the next couple of weeks when the elections take place and the president's going to continue to lay out that case but at the same time we're condemning violent and calling on all Americans to come together\nThere's a difference between comments made and actions taken the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball field\nThat should be a pretty pretty clear line right the standard here isn't some big shock it's not some huge surprise it's not something that we need to take a step back from an ... hold on a second ...\nHow do we how do we do that how do we deal with this right you are not responsible for what someone else does because of your politics\nYou may be responsible for violence if you directly incite violence and that's why even with our First Amendment there are\nSome exceptions for incitement to violence right if you're in front of a big crowd and you say burned down that store across the street and then they burned down that store you are morally called the Boeing and legally\nLiable for that ...\nYou know but but if you say I think we should have lower taxes in this country and then someone hears that and\nThey run down and they like the IRS building on fire\nYou are not responsible for that okay because if that were the case I\nThink about how that could be abused think about the way this would expand the hecklers veto think about how that would shut down discussion and debate anytime somebody wanted to just credited political beliefs audiologist all you have to do is that one person yes that's right and false like fashion\nAct like a complete idiot\nAll they have to do and that everyone says oh see see that and it's just common by the way you see this with this is a a continuation of a debate you have with radical Islam\nThe last will always rush to say that radical Islam is not in any way representative of Islam and at any jihad or jihad is our representative of the broader Islamic faith they will say that\nAnd then when you were responsible hold on a second I mean who are you to or you'd have to declare what isn't is not Islamic remember Obama sat at the un and the future just knocked belong to those whose land or the prophet of Islam one of the strangest things us presidents ever said and that kind of form\nA but they'll fight tooth and nail on that one meanwhile if some guy you know somewhere who's white named Billy Bob uh says something mean to somebody and and says something racist or whatever to someone and\nHim as a hate crime that one incident is magnified it did it by the media is oh my gosh there's look at all the hate in this country\nLook at how hateful we there's three hundred and twenty million of us want an idiot somewhere did something bad\nBut he's white and male and on the right so that means that the right has to own this whole thing because because one guy said something racist because one racist incident when is it the exception when is it the norm\nThis is a very important perception game that the media engages in all the time and this is where\nWe can't we can't give any ground\nWe do not have a political culture that embraces mob tactics intimidation and violence similar to what the left as we just simply do not doesn't matter that there's one incident this one individual has done this this has been roundly condemn\nWe ... with ... there's not a single conservative of any standing anywhere in the country who was that anything other than this is disgusting this person should spend the rest of his life in prison or work with persons\nProbably one guy but we'll see\nBut on the left you'll hear well there's no there's no such thing as mobs really there's no problem with getting up in people's faces and yelling at them there's no reason to demand civility when you're dealing with a political party that his show on uncivil in its ideas according to\nPeople like Hillary Clinton [noise] the

O. J. now has the ability to pull records you know they they might be able to see some communications perhaps between sweat make other people but you know this ...\nYou want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're going to sign ridiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean the whole thing is\nThey can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her July they must both be criminally prosecuted the law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room for interpretation here if they can prove it now\nThere is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because\nHer charges were so vague or the statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't\nBut then again she changed her testimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fixed but an obvious fix that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention\nOkay this really is too much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now but\nIf they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie I\nThink about what that does to the narrative and I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer consequences because they are doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life isn't attempted ruin nation of a human beings life that\nMust be punished crystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the\nUh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina\nThat they do across team rape curbs complete fabrication a total lie which you find a guy was raping her who was miles away and an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... and he should have gone to prison for a long time but the justice part and\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend stabbed to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today not only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process\nBut if we really do care about truth and decency injustice in our system\nIf we care about due process and\nThe right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed at the political whims of a left for their convenience\nThan people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left is going to kick in scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet is it clear to me that sweating as a liar absolutely absolutely\nI as I did I Know she's a liar not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone spiked\nPunch at a party which what what was that even mean that was such a crazy thing to say in the first place\nHe spiking much he's drinking the punch how would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's going to poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move think about that she didn't she didn't say spiking a drink spiking an entire punishable determines drink\nYeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just\nIt's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged deranged I mean\nAnd that's what they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie\nThe story will be she's not a sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was a sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the\nFinal nail in Kavanaugh's confirmation coughing she's of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences of our actions to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it\nAnd she ... she sworn affidavit that either has meaning or does it so I Hope Grassley pushes this and the DEA OJ needs to investigate this\nAnd uh we'll see how far they're able to be able to take it I think that this could end very very poorly for\n... and

cannot have the legal right to come to this country and get kind of part of this caravan any kind of in our country and well they returned home\n\nOkay that's true but but but\nThey're being coached along the way they are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't even have to\n\nIt's it's sort of switched around it used to be that Central American\nImmigrants at the border would would would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border\nAnd so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central America but now that's changed because of this asylum claim situation\nAnd as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced a border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the uh immigrations and Customs Enforcement\nProcess that they are from Honduras um they are going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and\nLetting the injured the United states and uh as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I must be in your pocket or whatever the issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum\nIs they need to change the asylum process so that you apply in your in your country or in the nearest country you can get you out of a U.S embassy and that there is a process as it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nI'm a because you're walking within walking distance the United states that's not\nThat's not the way that this law should be but uh as important that there's something called a safe third part said third country agreement is while I like to tell you things on the show that you want to hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that his time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some crazy concoction and we've we've discussed\nThe possibility of this uh at the government government level with Mexico but what it would mean is that we would set up at the border but on the Mexican side of the border we yes we would probably have to pay for this and I was a book they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it\nWe would set up a centrally trailers you know a holding facility Sunday is not attention facility but it's\nA what would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation it would be a place where people you know they have\nUh they're they're able to stay safe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the border and we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nAt port of entry court so you would start would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border\nAnd people that were waiting for their adjudication ... so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border\nWhich means that they don't uh ... they're not able to just go further and further and ensure United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is\nDenied guess what they they get to stay in Mexico or\nOr the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin of it that way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important we understand that they are not illegal immigrants they may cross illegally\nSo then they are in the U.S illegally but at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants go into the asylum process and then they're due process allows them to stay in the United states that\nIs the law I've talked to senior immigration officials about this is talk your wars about this that's how this works\nSo we need to take action here beyond just we're going to enforce the law the border that's great that's a good start but if you have this caravan of seven thousand that gets all the way even if it's only a thousand that gets to the border\nI'm at you know on a day at the election again that's not right in fact I think to have to understand I very much light pole\nSo okay\nI mean Bruce or Mike right I Want to bring you as a as an impartial observers here at you know you can tell it's a little there's a little bit back and forth but there's nothing to do crazy there right now

America bugs that thing is that\nGee what can I Do that will ah brighten up your day a little bit it's been a tough week for America right no question about the market's been getting battered obviously we've got these uh bombs getting sent all over the country people are being nasty to each other there's mobs everywhere and all that stuff right\nWhat can I Do that will just bring it all home and make us remember you know what\nIt's all going to be okay um well what if I told you that Chelsea Clinton's thinking about running for political office\nTo see what I did there that's right I got you ready for one thing and then I pulled out another how\nShe is thinking about it which being cheese gonna do it she's gonna do it\nFolks she was talking to the journal news at a stop on the tour for her new children's book starting now you can make a difference just\nJust try to you know she she really needs more cash she lives in a ten million dollar apartment in New York or mom's worth a hundred million her husband is a hedge fund guy but you know what what whatever kind of cash grabs you can go next right\nHaving children's books ghost written for oh man oh man it's amazing\nShe Chelsea said quote I think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it match my talents I'd have to think if it's the right choice for me she added she doesn't have any plans to run for office but it's something I think about\nAs I Hope every young person thinks about first of all no\nI Do not want put put aside Chelsea Clinton for a second here why put aside a Chelsea and just know that not every person not every person should be thinking about running for office at all okay there's there's a really very limited number of people that have the kind of\nA thick skin temperament\nSelf aggrandizing attitude and yes that you'll call to serve but increasingly I think\nPoliticians are mostly megalomaniac um there there is an increasingly small number of people I think that really should do this\nAnd I think that everybody should I Love is where I Want to talk about term limits I mean this is just this notion that we have the political class that we do and they just stay in power forever is because the system is set up to the people that determine what the system is staying power but maybe the conversation about terminals will have to wait for another time\nI just think that the Chelsea Clinton is the notion that somebody would\nWant to vote for this person who's never had a real job are and who was sort of let's not forget according to even some leaked emails were started very poorly\nAt the uh you know the foundation the bill and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation where she was supposed to be a a boss and a figurehead at the same time she was not well regarded there are people thought that she acted kind of like the ... boss's daughter which is what she was\nAnd I you know this is one problem are going to have on the right now and I want to get too deep into this but\nWe one thing that we have given up is for for quite a while we're not going to be able to complain about nepotism or just not not with any not without being as hypocritical as the left is\nSo I and I'm not saying that this is the end of the world I'm not saying it's a huge deal but just to understand that when they try to put forward\nChelsea Clinton and they will there's cause the Clinton it's it's the Clinton named the Clinton brand is still so well known and by so many Democrats despite what they'll say about Hillary behind closed doors are they still think of the Clinton at the Kennedy ask dynasty they really do\nAnd Chelsea doesn't have any of the baggage of bill or Hillary baggage I don't know a baggage I'll just you know likes to say hot ladies uh doesn't have any of that so they're going to trot her out and people like me will say she has no record of any accomplishment she's a brat she's never had a real job\nAnd and likes to go and give lectures what is she getting people lectures on what is she going to give speeches on having jobs that she's been given because of who are parents are no the the the struggle Israel being a\nA political celebrity and incredibly you know it'd be three incredibly wealthy people throw thirty thousand dollars at you for a speech when you're not even go to public speaking that's what she has I'm not trying to be mean I'm trying to just give a real assessment of the situation\nA and I'm telling you she's going to run so if you think that we've had the end of talking about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton dynasty\nAnd I know I said that this was going to this was meant to cheer you up at a I guess you could say had fake yoyo because obviously this is a go
