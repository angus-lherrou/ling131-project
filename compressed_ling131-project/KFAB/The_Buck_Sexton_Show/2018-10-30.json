synagogue over the weekend\nAnd\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump\nWas too friendly and too favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews it still Trump's fault now if we take this theory\nAt face value this theory that Trump is just raised hate in America let's be clear that that means that not Trump is responsible\nNo matter who in gauges and a hate crime against anyone else you know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic you know hate crime in this country\nLet's say you know ... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremist let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault I Want to know where the lines are drawn here and I think the answer by the way they would claim it's Trump's fault because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were to radicalize it would be because of Trump's\nAnti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because she has implicitly encourage them they'll say\nIf a anti\nSemite who is anti Trump or they you know good on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there's violence and bloodshed here in America and there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness\nAt it's at the root of it all it is Trump's fault they say this is delusional and\nIt's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe\nThat he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time in ways that I Can't even begin to fathom\nI I I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live in brief\nPolitics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and anchors and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like what are they\nWhat it will play something for you later you'll here's what is that even me\nWho are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions I mean this is how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously\nOn this they will try to escalate rhetoric while saying that rest a rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side as bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents let them beat you into submission bludgeon you into silence on issues that matter to you by\nAttaching all these issues all these problems all this violence is nothing to do with it they're calling President Trump and anti Semite I mean President Trump grew up in New York City he's served as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Trump is is has had\nCountless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish his son in law's Jewish market convert to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti Semite\nNot even a little bit not even close but they say this the\nMedia says they pat themselves on the deck oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power\nKnow you're a bunch\nOf destructive little individuals that are saying this\nIt's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else\nWho hates the president who despises his position for Jews\nDecides to be violent engages in this in this replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy trying to track attach Trump to this though it's just\nSo intellectually dishonest it show unfair and\nIt just goes to show you that there is there's no effort in good faith there is no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault by the press drive I I agree with Trump\nAnd that the press does drive a lot of this because the press is full of a bunch of training self obsessed self righteous jerks\nNot all of them obviously and I know ... book you're in the media the I'm telling you what Ninety percent of the media is like\nThey are not good\nPeople they're not\nHonest or not ethical it's all about the self it's all about the agenda they are activists posing as truth tellers eighties destroying this country from the inside they're the ones undermining institutions they're the ones undermining public trust\nAnd they turn around and accused everybody else did exactly that they tell you that Trump won't take responsibility to take responsibility for nothing\nWrong story after wrong story all critical of Trump oh that's just a coincidence as if we're idiots we're really supposed to believe that yeah sure it's just a coincidence\n\nThey are disgraceful and they're tearing this country apart and I have to say that it's very frustrating as well because it's the ... if we were able to focus on what's really happening in America and the in the direction of the country right now\nAnd how we're all doing this country is doing very well this country is on the right path\nBut the left can't make a fair arguing about why it's not so what do they do they make it about a motion to make it about anger and viciousness and destructive politics\nAnd law and that's what they're doing that's what they're doing with the president\nAnd we're going to continue to see this unfortunate where we're going to talk about the

but it is telling them that what you're doing a is okay and that's why yes there are always been an anti Semitic incidents in American history\nNationalism go hand in hand with anti Semitism the entire idea of anti Semitism is to put shoes outside the body politic outside the death of ... of ... and that's what Donald Trump does that mean that is what his party is now committed to doing\nA lemon nation is rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point he doesn't dog whistle teams as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him\nAnd this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Trump's fault I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that uh\nIt is directly somewhat you know they'll always put his paw far Trump's fall to the extent\nOr you know Trump Trump shit old some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful but when you have the\nIndividuals in the media who have taken Trump's entire presidency so personally and as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are\nAre there are no limits really on the vial that they will throw at this present there are no there's no good faith there's no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him and ask you a supporter\nDo all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this\nHeaving hatred of the Trump voter to a that's a part of the anti Trump movement they they despise the voters they don't because they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining were good with it were like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us because of that\nAnd that's why they feel completely justified and saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a\nAnother Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the difference is it was always\nOn the friend in the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated this ah what's happened and what so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories and it is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that he can go on TV that Dana Milbank the Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he was explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump why didn't Trump condemn white nationalist and people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surging and will say well we're on a second\nTrump has called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate he said this many many times then they'll say well the ... from talking about like national is so much you can't win folks you you know there's there's nothing he can do that will make them stop\nCalling him a racist stopped calling him a white nationalist they they do not extend the most basic\nLevel of good faith do them in any of these discussions and and they love to try it out these these fake conservatives and he's fake Republicans like Jennifer Reuben who's that she is the queen of fake Republicans the Washington Post still lists or other Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing\nBut you know she she blames Trump not just for what happened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like the poor\nAnd I got a ton of the ... side of town on how to fly in fact\nI Will say that we've had at fifty seven percent tax and the last hair and anti snack hate crimes\nFor the biggest thing and anti Semitism is that here's our outsiders they are Atlanta they define a nation by name\nBy whites and that's and if even believe that they do not believe that she was our white hot and that everyone else is Ellie and everyone else has the threat that troll America is not\nAll men are created equal it's not an ideal is adequate only and it is flattening fill out the entire idea of anti Semitism is to put choose outside the body politic and that's like Donald Trump guys\nThat's what he does by having a Jewish daughter and a Jewish son in law and numerous Jewish grandchildren\nThat's what he does by having senior Jewish advisors in the White House by being a better friend to Israel by leaps and bounds than Obama ever was\n... foreign foreign president who is probably the most popular American presidents in Israel the state of the Jewish people for president of that stature to be called an anti Semite just goes to show you how desperate\nThe left release to try to make this sick\nAnd I know that there is a fight within the Jewish community right now about well he's actually spoke to a rabbi about it today I'm On my other show or what we do well he's good on Israel but they don't like some of his domestic policies but they do like some of his other domestic policies but they don't like is\nA you know just tweeting at his ... and you know and that's great the Jewish communities vibrant with political disagreements like like any vibrant community would be over politics it's not a monolith in any sense\nBut there's not this overwhelming belief and all that he's anti Semite that's just that's fantasy land stuff that's just not true it's not reality\nAnd they're so desperate to try to make this\nWhat people believe what they think and what you're seeing here in this last\nCouple of weeks before the midterm election is that the Democrats really all they have is that Trump is hateful Trump is terrible they hate Trump and so they want people to vote against Trump they think that Trump is\nAnd believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worth as human beings and as citizens of this great nation\nSo when the last try so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right I mean the right\nA meeting all of it I was at its peak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves and the right and you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way are they conservative though you know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing and left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead\nOf the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in the common good as defined by a core of elites\nThat all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave as elites in separate from the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to beat the other side politically which would be us\nWe are the individual is we are the individual rights\nWe're all God's creation we're all\nHuman beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life\nAnd that has an obligation on all of us um when when they try to\nMake this case that racism and anti Semitism and these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I have a a real feeling of uh of outrage at that because it's show\nOn true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nA it is a shame that so many of the\nThat the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really believe that I Know this from talking to them they really believe that conservatives\nAre racist they believe that and you and I said you knowing that that is a lie it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left that\nAdvocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender\nThey're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race and gender and these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear\nThat our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people\nAnd there has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two party this is why Democrats you get so\nGarr I say triggered when it has brought up that they are the Democrats are the part or a party of\nSlavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats Democrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how does the masses view an issue\nWhat did they demand what did they show what where's their rage directed that has been\nThe aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party there's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and the natural law that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers said it's at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths\nAbout human beings what is always true about people what is always good for society\nTo promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just [noise] it is the exact opposite of a true conservative to believe that first left them because they can use a person who's left because of gender less then because of religion [noise]\nThat is not who are [noise] and I know that you know that as I Know

P. R. C. down in Houston every night Mitchell Jesse Kelly ... have you on\n... to be here buck happy to do it rather\nUh so I you know I I'm always a little\nFrustrated 'cause I'm not surprise surprise not the right works I Know that after a terrible shooting incident wherever it is there there's always just ingestion of oh why do you bring up armed guards\nAs though that some crazy idea\nOr you know I've I've seen plenty of armed guards and or armed police at major religious sites where I grew up in New York City I just don't know Jesse why this gets dismissed by the ... I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the leftist dismisses this out of hand we really do just want to save lives\nThen that's where it gets dismissed for simple reason just because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the truth it is a simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make believe we have armed guards\nEverywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place that the target or potential target\nHas an armed guard side of it or close to ... that's called security that's the norm that's the real world but even bringing up an actual solution is just going to get your reactions a horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every law abiding citizen\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place that\nGenerally speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting necessarily depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in the Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know none of the parishioners are ever armed or you know I don't know in other congregations there ever arm\nUh but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you are\nBut the the idea that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological out of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a ...\nAnd ... that's that's either a law abiding gun owners showing their side arm war is trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement\nThe last thought that ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean this seems very basic\nWell it seems basic to you both because you were CIA and you have comments that you do you acknowledge the way the world really is but I I one thing I have come to grips with\nIs how frightening guns of any kind or for those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one never been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it\nAnd honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nI Know I think he may go to the point and you know I Know you're not just the tax in but also were a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there but you know you you look at\nThe the cultural differences in the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp\nAs an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts I mean they think this is crazy sounding but it just goes to show that part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have similarities with guns all that's a big part of it\nThey've also been raised to think where they'd they'd been led to believe by their peers and those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the states are always a bad thing really I mean that's really the belief and also by the way Jessie the people who are part of the state apparatus meaning there aren't police or military who want to have guns or at best suspect and at worst a threat\nYeah my kids are not the vote shot fires before real gun not just Bebe gun shot guns they're familiar with them they have had gun safety drilled into their heads\nThey know where the weapons are in our whole they know they're never allowed to touch them unless I'm Around that lie and guess what they're safe with them but you but what it looks really funny as you mentioned a cultural issue and I understand having lived in the northeast I've lived all over how people view it differently\nBut here in Texas and other places that I've lived it is the norm for people to carry in church I put up a tweet the other day I think you are in saying if you are license\nIf you were trained to do so to not have your weapon on you in a place of worship you have massive amounts of people that are prime targets for evil sitting there with their back to the door stop living in this\nRosy world of make believe and acknowledge the world as it is sick monsters like this scum bags shot up the synagogue ... is not the last one on earth I promise you so he's carrying church\nAbsolutely I I carry in church every single Sunday swell in general if your city I bought but in church a hundred percent of the time I'm Jerry voted on it and they were not just it's really funny\nYou would love this we have these things called notice it's up to the church I go to we have these cowboy churches where people will just show up in boots in jeans and I'm not kidding they ride horses to church they will open carry firearms\nIn church the one my buddy goes to he has a Copenhagen in his lip as it gets the sermon a pastor in a post on is it\nNow you can make fun of that that people will is so absurd redneck caricature but the bottom line is that's the safest church on the planet ain't nobody shooting that place\nWould think so I think that I think it's a fair point so I just again a if we're going to talk about\nSolutions real solution is should be treated at least or at least real or you know I\nAnd or at least you're not supposed to say you want it\nThat's where we are with us she she has not given up one bit she still thinks\nThat this is the way that it's all going to go and and what a what a a a a crazy story and her mind it's got to be for running against Brock Obama losing run against Trump and losing\nAnd in the end though in her mind justice prevails and she sets right the world and you can tell that she said oh you know there's so much work to do in her ... her mind set her attitude is alright America you know I'm the one that's got to fix fix the mess\nThat that Trump created and oh by the way you own this to me you owe me the presidency\nThat hasn't changed one bit and she is very much still in that mindset so I Know it's a little early but keep in mind that next Jews or this coming Tuesday went out yeah next Tuesday is next Tuesday the midterms will be over and the presidential election will begin\nA next Tuesday is when we start to talk about who's really going to run the Democrats I think about what you're going to have a huge deal the candidates on the\nDemocratic side I think you're going to have a a massive field of all kinds of people including some real characters I'm not totally convinced that I have an ... he still thinks that or doesn't still think that he's going to run on I'm not convinced\nAs crazy as that may really be to anybody who's living in the real world I Would not be surprised if you did in fact have an ... candidacy I could see I could see that happening and I think that you look at some of the others out there\nElizabeth Warren probably still going to run again focus conscious herself still going to run because she thinks that in the Arab Trump\nAll that matters is that you deliver for your side and no matter how humiliating her whole fake Native American or deal may have been she thinks that she can still deliver\nA socialism for America that's that is what the fights going to be make no mistake about it this is going to be about this election\nWill be about socialism the last election was about the crony corrupt ... Clinton's that was quite alliteration but you know what I mean the last election was about the progressive media elite establishment finally getting getting the upper cut that is so deserved after all these years\nAnd the next election is going to be socialism\nNo doubt in my mind it's going to be open forget about the kind of Bernie Sanders cuddly I just want free school stuff is going to be open a Seventy percent tax rate kind of\nRedistribute the wealth reparations for all kinds of historical wrongs a massive government intervention the healthcare\nMarkets open borders so that you can dilute whatever pain the productive citizens feel by just drowning out their votes with with new arrivals are that's going to be with the next elections all about and what's with that in mind by the way that I think of some of these\nSome of these never Trump ... are just getting crazier and crazier you know they they'd gone from Russia collusion and now they have to find something else to justify their their hatred\nAnd I mean Max Boot I feel weird even talking about him because he's such a weirdo and show in significant in terms of his influence and his thinking in the in the conservative movement in fact the only influence he had was to get us into wars that we're a at least in one case very\nBad idea [noise] um but you know\nHe'll just slander Trump with stuff like the\nFox News on that crowd Breitbart and enforcing the Daily Caller Republican congressman they vilify George Soros for years and basically because George Soros is a rich through and so when they talk about Soros they're talking about\nA rich Jew who's in control of everything or when they talk about global us which is a trend that first right when ... when Trump says Kobus rightwing extremist here and Jews this is repugnant dog with language has gone out and you're right it's not just ... a lot of Republicans it's a lot of folks at Fox News they really everything that he's saying is ...\nBy the way everything people don't refer to anti\nSemitism when there's criticism of Sheldon Adelson who is a very wealthy Jewish Republican donor\nThat's apparently not anti Semitic this notion that global is it some kind of dog was global is is a term that's been used in international relations\nAre for decades and has nothing to do with someone being Jewish ... Jimmy Carter was a global is I mean there there are lots of people that you could look at him referred you historically that work for you then as global nothing to do with Judaism or certainly with anti Semitism\nUm but ... says that if you're going to go to the other team\nBut not enough to just say I don't like Trump you have to say I despise Trump I hate Trump I'll do anything I'll say anything I Will bend the knee and beg forgiveness from a left and be a turn coat and slander all my former friends and allies I don't know how these people sleep at night\nI Can't imagine turning on all the people that I respect and work with no now and and ideologically in line with and later just turn around because it was\nConvenient for me and call them all ...

about the war on a pool before\nBut now they finally decided that it's not just that there there were some concerns or some ideas out there that they were going to have somebody else voice a pool 'cause Hank owes area who is the\nUh the guy who wrote voice and that was a white guy you know the whole lot of voices voice actor but he he's a white guy voicing a brown guy which is obviously on this for the social justice love it's a big no no\nBut they're actually just going to or at least the latest sporting I saw as yeah that's right there are writing him out of the show saying that uh you know that that they're running on the show now some people are\nPushing back on that saying that it's not true that he's not being written out of the show and I I think they are responding to back last year because people were saying really that this is where it is now\nNow now you you can't have this cartoon characters been around for Twenty years and and I would note a pool is yes he's a stereotype or on the show for sure there's no question right he's a stereotype but he's also not ... you know he's a family managed to successful business owner I really mean that I mean it's not\nHe's not being put down in fact he's often used on the show to highlight the silliness stupidity and ... of other people\nWhereas you know he's actually kind of living the American dream has got a nice wife you heard or on the than the when we came into secondary got a whole bunch of kids he's a business owner I mean you know that's what a lot of people aspires you in this country for themselves\nAnd and he's not you know there's this big difference between laughing Adam laughing with a pool is I've seen enough of the same thing to see many episodes certainly not all of them it's been on for Twenty years\nBut of who they laughed with character you know you're laughing with it and you find him funny he does insightful political commentary yes he has an accent and yes there is some stereotypes behind it but it's all being used for the purpose of\nNot just entertainment but also a inside and I just think that they're being really unfair to the character but I I Would say this\nYou know over the weekend 'cause the political correctness thing everyone hates it except for the twenty percent of the country are so that are just social justice left\nManiacs everyone hates this cult of political correctness this idea that we can't laugh at anything any more nothing is allowed to be funny anymore everything has to be treated with this you know this deadly seriousness and there's no way for us to just be normal people uh who can laugh at things that a normal person would find funny\nWe all reject this but we find ourselves still stuck in the totalitarian psychological prison all the time of the politically correct speech and and thought police but I'm\nHappy though that they're not I'd I'd rather them get rid of a food than just you know do what they usually do which is either take the character and remove any hint of humor from him\nRights and all of a sudden a pool was going to have like an English accent and be a Harvard professor and just make fun of like the stupid fat\nWhite people like The Simpsons character Homer all the time you know that that's one way that they would go\nOr the social justice would a warriors would want this to go\nA ... and in another way that they would go would be to use them to make social justice you know to make more social justice related point you know and all of a sudden a food so I just I I don't want any of that you know I just part of me is happy they'd rather get rid of this character then destroy the character I I think that's a\nThat's one maybe silver linings holding but it's just indicative of how I don't even know what what's allowed to be ...\nThe lottery funny anymore because you know it's going to change in a year and not based on humor but based on what is acceptable based on\nWhere the left wing draws these boundaries and these lines and something as as really honestly durable and the comedy world as the Simpson has been around for decades their college courses taught on the social commentary and Simpsons believe it or not that's a real thing and The Simpsons has really stood the test of time\nWhen The Simpsons isn't safe anymore that then you know there's really nothing and there's so little out there that I find funny it so often the case\nThat humor is now blended with political commentary because it's a it's a cheap and an easy way to try to build audience right away what you do is you go from a laugh but you have the right people and then there are more prone to pretend you're not funny jokes are funny I mean this would be able to Amy Schumer she's not funny she just plays the politics right\nAnd people pretend like she's a comedian she's not a comedian she's a crappy political commentary a person a spokesperson or whatever you wanna call or pundit\nWho also makes jokes there's a lot of that these days and not a lot of actual comedy so you know at a pool looks like he's gone that's the way this country's going these days [noise]\n[noise]\n\nEverybody I'm
