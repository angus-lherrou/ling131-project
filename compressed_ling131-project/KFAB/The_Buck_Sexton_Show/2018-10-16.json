P. D. crews working to get the power back on after yesterday's snow spokesperson Jody Baker says crews are now making individual repairs\n... is taking a little bit longer than previous repairs\nThat this would bolster her claim I don't know which is worse here uh that Elizabeth Warren is show\nDelusional she thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as it as to think that this will stop\nContinued mockery of her for racial fraud I mean the hill where I work in response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the real headline here if I may finally be civil\nIs it there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor a couple of hundred years ago and since then it has been one long on on on interrupted line of white people in fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American\nCompared to the general white American population she is less than\nAverage inner connection to the Native American population meaning you and to me listening as if you happen to be white and an American and a lot of you or not but if you have been white an American\nIs likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are\nHere we are she she must have thought that this was going to\nUh give her some degree of of credibility I I don't know what she's thinking I mean ten generations ago there's no realistically there's no way to know if even the Ken generations ago if this is accurate\nAnd then when you when you look at the Boston Globe analysis and you start to read some of this you realize that this is all it's all\nKinda hazy in nonsense anyway quote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of Warren's DNA done by Carlos boost the Monterey who's a professor at Stanford a really he tracks DNA Analysis via population migration\nHe quote concluded that the vast majority of warns ancestry is European but the result strongest support the existence of an on ad mix a Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago um this folks\nIf Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person\nIs that if Elizabeth Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American literally any white person in the country could credibly claim to be Native American\nFor professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even matter if you call yourself Native American it would no longer make any difference if you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's every but we're all Native American by their standard\nThis is completely nuts this is completely nuts\nAnd the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling her Pocahontas as\nWe know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed to force this incredible uh on for stare on on her part is just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting in the top\nFour or five of early support from the Democrats for running for president and most of the polls that I've seen in fact as being CNN poll out where I think she came in for third or fourth\nPlace um and and when you look at this analysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat is\nAmazing to me that that anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she was right [laughter] I mean she's\nShe's like one one thousand Native American may be and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration from South of the border in the United states\nSo she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes and yet people in the media are saying sushi prove that Trump is wrong Trump needs to pay up\nNow what what\nAre they had desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh Elizabeth Warren has completely clown herself here I mean it just made a complete mess of things and so there that the media has\nTo go even further and they have to somehow pretend like\nYeah that's right you prove thinks that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it but well what else are they going to do I mean this is a this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips\nIs bonkers\nAnd on this notion even that that she has any Native American ancestry let me just give you this is from his post\nUh this analysis in the Boston Globe quote detecting DNA for Native Americans is particularly tricky because there was an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison\nThis is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal numbers not to participate in genetic databases to make up for the ... a dearth of Native American DNA bustamante guy during this analysis use samples from Mexico Peru and Columbia just stand in for Native American\nThat's because scientists believe that the groups Americans are ... to his Native Americans came to this land via the bearing straight about twelve thousand years ago and sold them what's now America but also market further south whose report explaining to use a reference populations genetic material has been sequenced for was designed for ... accuracy\nA so folks he's using South American DNA on this theory that oh well because they all across the Bering Strait\nI mean this is crazy this is crazy he's not even\nUsing Native American DNA to look for DNA that crosses over with with Elizabeth Warren's back right now I\nI uh there's more here there's more there's more in the in the why it matters and you're hearing all these pathetic justifications

look at what's really happening on across the board right now with with the media and with the effort to take down Trump anything is acceptable as long as it is for\nThe cost I mean anything is going to be considered okay here as long as it is a evidence or ... useful in the anti Trump cause I just I\nI've reached that kind of a new a new level here at a new degree of understanding of just where the media is taking all this stuff and and what they're willing to do what they're willing to put the American people through a in terms of propaganda and and\nThe whys and there's no way that a normal person could have read that Boston Globe report today\nAnd come away from it with anything other than wow that is a massive mistake that Warren has made here and she's clearly not Native American she never should have claimed to be Native American there's nothing\nHer that justifies this notion of Being American and yet you know all I see right now on the on the front page of CNN here's a perfect example I see nothing in their main headlines all about the Saudi guy got which we'll talk more about your market show you later\nBut nothing about that you go down one two three four five six seven eight eight stories down the CNN front page right now and you get quote Warren's DNA never matter to\nTrump or how\nIs this Trump's fault in one world is this is the takeaway here that Trump isn't a\nYou know accepting her DNA results or something these people are insane they really are I I ... or they're ... it's just impossible for them to be a ... embarrassed here's another reason other version Huffington Post Trump denies this is their top story about this Trump\nDenies making charity pledged tied to Elizabeth Warren DNA test Trump sad and was it was very specific Trump said that if she makes it through\nThe primaries and is the Democrat now than me and then and then she proves that she has Native American heritage in that case will get a million dollars for favorite charity so that's what he said okay he denies what they're saying he said which is he would just give her a million dollars if you Bruce you Native American\nAnd not even is not the point because if she Native American everybody's\nNative American and anyone who's trying to be honest anybody who's looking at this from the perspective of I Would like to really present the facts and and get to the truth here would automatically understand is I'd vicious just pathetic it is\nAbsolute nonsense that I'm seeing here from\nAll these different all these different sources the way that they're covering this I mean they're they're trying so hard to actually\nCover is the right word because they're really covering for Warren\nAnd this is because what they think happened today is a ... thing happened today is that she's no longer really going to be a serious contender for twenty twenty this is laughable she's a clown she's a joke\nShe was a joke she should be at least\nHere's ABC News which is supposed to be unbiased Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results on Native American ancestry a Trump says quote who cares\nThat's their headline that the headline to\nSee this is a perfect case of media bias at work they think that they're progressive great hope for twenty twenty is in jeopardy right now because of her own just bone headed stupidity I mean this is just on cinco de dum on think of lead them\nAnd they're going to do whatever they can to try and and lessen the damaged or they're going to try to keep her brand keep her hopes for twenty twenty going\nAnd that means that that means all these different headlines where they're focused in on either Trump's response out of context or just that she released or DNA results this is a this is an embarrassment she's the one one thousand\nNative American maybe they didn't that prove that you've Native American and and now you\nSay get you what are we really going to do what it was really the result is going to be here of this in the long term I Would say that if someone if I for example I I Believe and this is based on family members of mine who have gone through this process but I Believe that I probably would have\nSomething around the around the ... uh lines of a one percent African DNA and now you might say buck I think everybody yeah maybe ever but I'm just talking about me I'm speaking from the perspective okay I think I kind of a one percent of Indian\nIf I applied to college now but that's not a that's not a federal criminal law or anything right and people say oh but you know she she didn't get any better but now she was hired through affirmative action that's why she did this because it was a huge career boost all through her career\nAnd it's a way of getting through the admissions process we're getting to the hiring process much more easily if I applied to Harvard where she was a law professor which is an embarrassment to Harvard by the way ... should be embarrassed and I said that I was African American\nPeople would rightly think that that was disgusting\nAnd I would be roundly criticized for that\nAnd and I think that that's that's fair that's true that's accurate I not African American and and it's a dishonest thing and it would be a dishonest thing for me to\nClaim that I was African American okay but why is that a terrible thing deserving of appropriate ... why is that something that we can all agree the media would get so upset about and Elizabeth Warren doing the exact same thing\nBut I just would I Would caution you all at the ACLU is not a reliable source at all or I'm Sorry ... Southern Poverty law that the truth of the ACLU as well so yes you keep that keep that in\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is not a reliable source when it comes to deciding who is a a a political extremist or a right wing extremist a white nationalist\nAny any of those things you cannot trust the Southern Poverty Law Center it has become a massive fundraising organization and a left wing really a left wing hate group and a lot of cases I mean any group that has to pay a multimillion dollar settlement you mentioned was ah for being an anti Muslim extremist when he's a Muslim\nIs a group that you probably want to take with a grain of salt whenever it comes to these uh these different demonstrations and and how they're reporting on who's there and what's going on so that's that's one part of it but then there's the other which is just\nThis idea that it is a normal thing to want to show up and do these counter protests and they call them counter protests but when people show up to a demonstration right and they're all wearing black and they have gas masks and shields and and and homemade weapons\nThey're not showing up because they want to engage in a battle of ideas they want to engage in a battle they want to fight people\nAnd the fact that they showed up with their spray and these other things tells you all that you need to know of but I just think it's so interesting which media outlets will and will not covered as this makes for really compelling footage\nThis is a story that you would think they'd want to tell you have a almost entirely white by the way antifa radicals who are attacking this this patriot\nPrayer group of ... they're called the law and order group rather they weren't a march for law and order I I've got an I've got to wonder\nIs is that just say is that a euphemism are they actually white nationals I mean I have no idea and I know that I Can't trust\n'em I I Can't trust the media to produce honest assessments of this and tell us what really happened\nFor example do just that they accept that there are counterprotesters and that you know the kind of approach as you just showed up and like they didn't want any problems man but you know there were problems well maybe it's because they showed up and the whole purpose of their presence was to ignite some kind of a confrontation right\nHe's gotten a gay man they gauge it you know ... you\nKnow they're showing up and they're screaming about fascism and Trump being a Nazi and they wanna they wanna hit people and they want to attack people and they want to do this little home videos of this because these are radical their political radicals\nAnd you know you could argue that the only thing that really separates them from a domestic terrorist organization is that to date anti has put a limit on the degree of their violence right they have not engaged in to my knowledge I might be getting something\nLethal action against Syria but they have engaged in violent action and keep in mind that violent action\nIf you have a very different very different political circumstances that could escalate it could escalate rather rapidly\nAnd all of a sudden a group that has issued lethality in the past when it comes with violence may maybe in a position where\nThey feel like that is open to them and in fact that's the path way that they take so I I Would just note that that's something that that I Want everyone to be aware of the ... has not been to this point\nA group that is engaged in straight up terrorism it used to be that the anarchists who are money a lot of anti for uh the anarchists in this country we're the real terrorists I mean the the sort of when I'm In real terrorists I mean they were the primary terror threat they're the ones who are assassinating presidents trying to blow up the stock exchange\nThat's where I was anarchists not Islamic radicals\nThere was another incident by the way I I Know I Would get hit if I didn't bring this went up there was another incident on a friday in New York City actually right in the neighborhood I think where I grew up in fact when I looked at the videos I could tell even the videos didn't show you much what street I think they were on when they had this fight\nOr there was this ... this group that the Proud Boys\nAnd I've never really understood\n... who they are or what what they are I I've heard that they have they have some\nI should actually probably just call Gavin McGinnis and ask you the metropolitan Republican club invited the Proud Boys are which is called it quote right wing fraternal organization in this in this one piece from reading and there were two or three counter protesters that were beat up now\nI don't know I wasn't there and I haven't seen much I've only seen a little bit of footage but were these counter protesters who are just there to have a discussion I think if you show up ... if you think that these are right wing radicals which obviously the counterprotesters do and you show up at one of their events\nAre are you planning to antagonize them and try to incite a confrontation or you really just want to share your thoughts do they think that they're going to scare the proud\nBoys I mean this is this what we ask that question what are they really doing their [noise]\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to

a communist\nSo Trump's as a kind of a Democrat\nHe also says you know that Trump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that category of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to\nWe need to make sure that we run all these stories about how Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have the right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love these White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about a so then I take a step back and I say hold on a minute\nGiven what we know about all the different leagues\nAnd all the people that are in the White House including Republicans who are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party\nPeople that are not on board with Trump at all we know that there's somebody right now who roads if you if you believe in New York Times and I don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now who wrote an op ed effectively saying that we're working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and\nTo go to these if you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the non editorial as we never found out of this guy was the anonymous\nEditorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody in this White House of course it would be silly to do that and that's also why I I give him more leeway than I Would then other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's\nConvenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if your Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become turn coats on it\nHow many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent recognition within party circles I mean you're talking about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpeting Moore I'm a Democrat\nIn that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be insane\nFor the president's a trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record and I'm like you're not telling me that he was really some of them you know telling you what I mean it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the facade\nOf you know I'm really giving you some access and inside here and I'm trying to build\nThis report and then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record it would make them look even better\nYou know they're like off the record I volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies for a burning building like is that really does that does that really have to be off the record senator so and so\nI guess so ah and then\nYou know the the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here\nLeslie stall in this interview uh had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left and the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position\nA since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that a stalled descent and they always do well it's your policy\nIt's your policy to separate parents from children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault\nAnd Trump's has but no it's the law and I don't think that they even I don't think he's media critics even really understand\nThat to say that it's the law is to say that it's actually the Congress\nThat does bear some of if not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either a napped or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is to find a way to adjust a law\nThat it's a bad law or to repeal it entirely\nIsn't really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration for him when he felt\nFrustrated with Congress ... articles er Cox I'm like well what about the sorry\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislative branches authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be and saying well it's just about enforcement is not just about enforcement when you don't enforce something at all\nIt's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted\nBy Congress and I think that's\nPart of this that just immediately that the the press puts aside pushes aside and they really assume I mean they really thought that they would uh they would be in a place where\nTrump and the Republicans would just get hammered on immigration they would be or they would be just crushed because of what I've been going out of the border and I think that they miscalculated\nThat for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told that\nYou know immigrants or do jobs or whatever and legal south folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing but a net positive for\nThe economy and they would like to have some re establishment of\nThe rule of law when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has been build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff that remains a remains to be done and I have a lot of concerns or whether it will even happen especially if the Democrats take the house\nBut all this on this issue of the border you can tell lovely so she just wants to oh the parents being separated from their children\nHappen under Obama it's a law that still on the books that was the law when Obama was an office and oh by the way the people that are getting separated from their children at the border were overwhelmingly explicitly trying to break US law\nThey were being picked up after crossing illegally then claiming asylum\nAnd this is after they it is essentially ignored the laws of this country because they think that you know they don't have to pay any attention to it you know if there's not going to be any consequences as off at all for that we should ask the question why I think that's fair news radio\nOr living [noise]\n\n\nThe FBI calls home titles asked one of the fastest growing crimes my

... were out there for me it constantly Saudi consulate in\nIstanbul and now we have this\nVery real looming international relations crisis on our hands or how did we\nHow did we get to this point how do we find ourselves in a situation where we have to deal with this you know the the president has raised the possibility of rogue killers\nBecause the president's I'm sure he's said that he spoke to\nA king Solomon behind the scenes keep in mind the king of Saudi Arabia is a pretty uh what's the word in from old men at this point it's really a NBS Mohammed bin Solomon who is the thirty three year old crown prince he's the guy who runs stuff\nHe's the one who has done this whole charm offensive in this country in big business and big media and big government all being buddy buddy with and the ...\nSo that's why this is such a shockwave through the elite communities the the Davos set is little oh my gosh we do know we can we can have the Saudis funding trips for us anymore\nUh and and there's there's the reality of what their soldiers of Saudi Arabia which is interesting and I'll get to that um and and there's also the pending\nProbably will be the case at some point when you watch the ... when you listen I'll watch when you listen to this show I Will have confirmation of it but as of right now it sounds like they are planning to say that this was a rogue element within the Saudi Government that's the latest reporting here\nOn the plan is for the Saudi Government to throw some intelligence official under the bus I've also seen early reports that it may be a maybe the Saudi government's position that an intelligence official decided to interrogate and it went\nOver the line um but the Saudis can't hide anymore that this guy was killed was killed in their\nCustody they're calling it quote an interrogation that went wrong that's that's the latest on that so it doesn't really seem like a there's any room for the Saudis to keep the assembling on is that they're they're caught the Saudis are in a jam here I'm as they should be the Saudi regime is\nA terrible and ah and disgusting government but we're not really often told that because they have a tremendous amount of sway even our own media they own a lot of shares a lot of very important media companies\nBut here's what you see the ... the payment that's going to happen it's already started to happen because you have this issue of a repressive fatalities Harry in\nMuslim how often do you hear about that a Muslim majority nation not just the Muslim majority nation entirely Muslim nation the most Muslim country by percentage I Believe in the world I mean maybe Somalia I mean there are a couple of other countries that are right up there but\nThe Saudis do not allow non Muslims to be you know citizens of the peninsula I mean the Saudis are\nDid they do not allow Christian worship or ceremonies were houses of worship to be a Jew can be built on on Saturday So this is a a hyper Islamist government which you don't ever hear hyper Islam his regime\nUm and I talked to a little bit about that holy but unholy alliance between the ... hobbies or the Salafis fundamentalist Islam and is Bedouin tribe\nA house of Saud that as the Saudi regime Saudi royal family so you know there's all this complexity on the issue but but here's what what's happening right now\nThis is going to quickly become a crisis that ... that is much more about what Trump does for our media than what it really means I'm already hearing you know\nBecause Trump ... up with dictators that's why this happens this is the line here there's all the time Trump is so is coddled dictators here here's what I Want to say to anybody in response to that cause you'll hear this all over the place the media next few days I don't think it's possible to call dictators\nMore than Obama did I I think it'd be very hard you'd have to work really hard to do so because Obama made some very clear errors in dealing with authoritarians is strongly for one is his word didn't mean anything when it came to consequences\nThe erasing of the red line in Syria led to a free for all by the Assad regime but also by the Russians that were backing up the Assad regime by the Iranians who sending troops into Syria\nObama's unwillingness to enforce a red line in Syria had tremendous consequences and you can say that he wasn't really coddling that dictator but he certainly made a lot easier for him\nObama and the left along with him do coddle all\nMarxist revolutionary style dictators in in in the western hemisphere\nThey did coddle Fidel Castro's Cuba a communist Cuba was receiving all kinds of\nA favorable treatment under the minister rationing and no punishments really doled out no carrot and stick just carrots when the Obama administration was dealing with them and the same thing could be said of Venezuela where yes Obama was not an increasingly overtime was less favorable toward the\nRegime of first job is and then made euro but\nObama had a soft spot for these marks his revolutionary types no question no question and then of course the mullahs in Tehran you know you want to talk about a soft spot how about getting them a deal that effectively\nPrevents any Israeli or other allied military action against the Iranian nuclear program and let them get wealthy and let them keep their nuclear program until they decide that they want to have a breakout at that point it's too late and\nThey'd have too much money and we're not going to stop them you know you you look at all these things you look at all these issues and you think your cell phone on a second what ... how do I even here this time what is this line about how\nTrump is coddling dictators he's too favorable toward dictators when when the reality as we see it is oh you mean nothing Trump does will ever quiet these critics nothing Trump could ever say we'll ever get them to stop claiming that he is in the pocket of\nOf of either ... or Kim Jong on\nMean he said it in the interview over the weekend with Leslie stall she goes well you said you're you said you're in love with Kim Jong il because like I I mean I'm just I'm Talking here you know I'm trying to say and we've got a good report you know what do you want me to say you're not going to get any or saying he's a a filthy evil murdering\n... myself when I was just you know I mean on Okonjo showed a curse word the oval office but all too much much worse stuff in the oval office you know Bill Clinton's\nDisgrace\nOr it's something that the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye they aggressively aggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people like Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was part of the Clinton machinery for example\nAnd he is treated with with ... he's a hundred million dollar men now ABC News anchor that has to be ... who decides to pay that much money it's\nIt's a stunning thing really is oh without Stephanopoulos who would watch these shows everybody would watch these shows these are platforms wherever they putting these roles is going to get a certain amount of viewership but he seems to get it excused\nFrom being a part of the country machinery and Hillary who just had her clearance taken away I wanted me to Hillary just was finally told you don't get to have a security clearance anymore for cereal and flagrant violations of national\nSecurity protocols for anybody who has a clearance she was just all that now she still hasn't raised show has been achieved even a modicum of honesty you could say to Bob from Obama not a smidgen ... she doesn't have a smidgen of honesty she's such a liar\nAnd she knows that she well she still thinks that she has a a political future\nAnd it would be a problem for her to the left has gone show all in on this whole\nMe too movement they've made this such a a prominent\nPart of what the left dance where now it's the ... movement of the moment I we've had black lives matter or we've had Occupy Wall street we've had these different\nA political ... revolutionary leftist movements in this country and right now it's the me too movement it will change they will move to some other intellectual fat or fashion in some time just just wait for it\nBut in the meantime they have to make sure that they don't have the weaponization of some of these things occurring\nBack on them like they don't want to score and their own goals here with me too movement and that DNA blurs and I've always felt that the enablers in this whole process we're getting off far too easy you know the people men and women around someone like Harvey Weinstein people men and women around someone like\nA Les Moonves you know those who were\nNecessary in this whole\nProcess are ... they don't get in trouble they don't really get called out and Hillary was the ultimate in that not only did she stand by her man of course as we know for the most obvious and a self interest\nThat political reasons imaginable Bush she went on the attack against these women and whenever I hear people say things like don't they have a right to be believed I always want to respond well\nTo the women that Hillary demeaned I mean did did the women that were completely attack verbally and the media down to their very character\nThey were all considered to be fighters for the cause at the time\nAnd there has been no accountability for that whatsoever and there's no accountability to stay for Hillary when when she held accountable for the fact that she was\nEssential in her husband's not just denials but continued flagrant violations of\nThe public trust and an overhaul Bill Clinton was accused of rape folks rape not just your ... and I really don't like and this happens you know this usage of the term\nSexual assault and sexual harassment being conflated with sexual assault and all of a sudden people are like well you know both sides have their problems you've got Clarence Thomas on one side Bill Clinton on the other no\nClarence Thomas was accused and I don't think particularly credibly accused of saying some inappropriate stuff in the office\nI mean a worst case basis Clarence Thomas should have been pulled aside by age aren't told hey you know knock that offered this going to be professional consequences that if he did it I think he did it Bill Clinton could have spent decades in prison for what he did the allegations against Bill Clinton were up of rape by force and that's\nThat's going to send you to prison for very long time I mean your your life is essentially over\nAnd he went on to be the ... the United states for eight years so yes Hillary coming out now and saying that she wasn't a part of any of this she lies now with such fluidity and so shamelessly I Would tell you all if you if you want to have a a quick and fun read go back and read\nChristopher Hitchens no one

where that is still true it it turns out that there are very few things that we can point to\nAnd say oh they would never they would never allow that thing to happen anymore because those examples that we used to use are increasingly now the reality on the left\nRight so this is that this is the perfect example you have the daily call here with a piece that a biological male\nWho identifies as a transgender woman\nWon a woman's world championships cycling event on Sunday you know Rachel McKinnon a professor at the College of Charleston won the women's sprint thirty five to thirty nine age bracket at the twenty Eighteen UCI master's tracks cycling world championship in Los Angeles\nSo we have somebody who is the first transgender woman world champion\nEver and we're supposed to celebrate this do they really expect us to celebrate this this is supposed to be treated like it is in some way a victory a victory for whom advocate for transgender rights\nCertainly not a victory for women the reason that we have sex segregated sports is not because of sexism and maybe this is where progressive\nJust can't follow the logic training or maybe they just are unable to understand this but the reason we have sex segregated sports is because men are overwhelmingly and invariably biologically larger heavier stronger and faster\nThan women as a function of hormones and genetics that's just that's the truth I mean I I used to occasionally with some friends of mine a scrimmage with some of the women's varsity teams when I was in college and then I can tell you that I a reasonably athletic\nCollege male would probably be a three sport superstar for most female programs if he had had some of the of the same skills by playing let's say on a high school team I mean that that's just the truth\nBut that's why we have sex segregated sports but the leftist show devoted to this idea of transgender rights in transgender resume\nAs something that must be celebrated remember I told you the the way that the progressive approach these issues is it starts with just just tolerant be tolerant and then it's you know be inclusive and then it's\nCelebrate it and then it's you know except except this or else which is basically a version celebrated but\nThey they always have this sliding scale and it will start just with oh just tolerate it that's the first thing and and then you have to you know later you off from it and then it'll be told the celebrated that's I skipped affirmed to celebrate their\nBefore but here we have it I mean if I told you five years ago that we would see pieces about how men could compete in female sporting events because they say they're transgender and that would be considered fair somehow on the left\nYou'd say buck that's just crazy and I would say well yes it's crazy but now it's true now it's happening\nA this that's why these here you have this is the ... this was the women's world championships women's world championships and or you have your men competing in these events now\nThe whole notion that we have to say biological mail I Would note is a misnomer because male is a function of biology as his female we can pretend that these things are separate we could pretend that they're distinct but we're just\nOnly fooling ourselves and and it can't be a shock to anybody that are on a day or it shouldn't come as a shock to on the same day we were told that somebody can claim to be Native American because they are point point point zero zero zero zero zero one seven whatever [noise]\nNative American and not even really Native American but actually from Hispanic or Latino or you know it's a background and it's not even clear that it's actually Native American that same day when science no longer matters is a day and watch all that we have to celebrate this this madness of a transgender ism\nAs somehow the best thing possible\nFor the future of the civil rights movement in this country I mean this is the new civil rights and that's why the left to show devoted to it it's a new civil rights movement but also there's\nAn underlying antipathy there's an underlying disdain that the a progressive last has for the distinctions between sexes\nFor male female gender roles or even male female gender stereotypes that they hate all of it they think they can eradicate it news radio\nOf living [noise]\n\nWith all the
