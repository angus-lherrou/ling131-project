she will vote in favor of judge Brett Kavanaugh for a Supreme Court seat\nThe allegation fail to me the more likely than not standard\nCollins says a presumption of innocence plus a lack of cooperation means sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh do not fairly prevent him from serving on the court\nShortly after Collins made her announcement another undecided Senate or West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he too will vote for Kavanaugh both announcements likely secure enough support for Kavanaugh before Saturday confirmation\nFox's German helping on Capitol Hill

Administration for withholding federal funds from so called sanctuary cities California\nFederal judge William Oric sided with the state and the city of San Francisco ruling that the Justice Department cannot withhold law enforcement grant money because the city or state declares itself a sanctuary judge or said the Justice Department mandate that local law enforcement agencies cooperate with federal immigration officials\nNot only violates separation of powers rules but also congressional spending authority the state attorney general said the grant announced that the Trump Administration wanted to withhold would've put more than twenty eight million dollars at risk to law enforcement\nFox's just gr Rosenthal investor concerns over rising interest rates pushing stock

brilliantly staged brilliantly written delivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time response\nSo after all of the theater this week after all the circus like atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington DC you ended with an epic finish\nSo bravo to you geo pay bravo to you\nAnd to the what was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure I think Spartacus got arrested today I'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for\nAh for Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I talked\nTo guys last night I found the ah yearbooks from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was the new year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar\nAnd I don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a\nBook or we call a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who\nSaid he had um\nGroped a young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called us stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was let's go all the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you\nGo back to the protests but there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember what sparked all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating\nMr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and on the day when that happened\nChris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue\nIn his role a Chris Matthews was on the air talking about\nRevenge\nAnd I tell you all of this all of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats it said when\nYou go out and develop all of your missions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two graves because you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth\nThis year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nSays this time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't a Chris Matthews\nIf you don't if you don't go after vengeance and he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss\nOr I'll I'll tell you talk about backfiring because the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today\nThey sounded like a bunch of people especially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a\nA good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity it's an absolute attorney\nSo I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interests of those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens when you get the house and the Senate and the president say in the very next election the midterms\nHistory tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the GOP to retain the house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that we share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun and I have a really\nRidiculous question for you I Know the other day I asked a question about what is the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum anger\nAt

system worked and it it didn't work really well because the only one Democrat out of forty nine Democrats is voting to confirm\nJudge Kavanaugh to elevate him to justice Kavanaugh only one out of forty nine\nThat's not a good thing\nThat really is not a good thing but there is good knows how to a new poll out of Fox that says are the things that are most important to people in the midterms the number one thing\nIs uh the economy now number two is health care and if you paid attention to date to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to\nPresident Trump in his speeches at these campaign rallies\nHe is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected so with the number one issue being the economy and the number to issue being health care the president a well he's already addressed the economy with the economy the economy's working it's bought off right now\nThree point seven percent unemployment the lowest\nSince Nineteen sixty nine and companies\nAre now are actually working to more people who left the employment world to come back to work they're trying to come up with new ways to get\nSome of the women who left to go have families to come back to work there are trying to get people to fill jobs in the manufacturing sector\nTo come back to work there are\nThousands upon thousands of good jobs in both manufacturing and then the trades\nThat are unfilled oh you have to do is listen\nTo what Mike Rowe talks about if you don't follow Mike Rowe on Twitter or Facebook or visit\nMike Rowe works on the line Mike Rowe works all one word you're missing out if you would like to have a career that you're probably never going to worry about being unemployed there are literally\nTens of thousands of jobs that are good paying jobs we're talking fifty to a hundred and fifty grand a year and\nThey are jobs you might need a little trade school for but micro works will show you\nHow you can uh get a skill and then go to work and my puts out scholarships for stuff like that\nSo uh check that I didn't mean to get off track oh also the fifth number one in all the top issues of what voters are looking for in the midterms to fit thing guns because Democrats are going to try and make gun rights again a big deal\nAnd Donald Trump is a I think Donald Trump is throwing a couple of bones towards the people who are a kind of squishy on guns now I'm a Second Amendment guy I'm On a\nLifetime enter a member I'm a concealed carry weapons permit holder I'm a believer in\nGetting trained and being sure you know how to operate\nYour firearms and keep them safe but I also understand that people are ... another bonus word of the day today hop all a phobia you don't want to ... ... is someone who when they hear the word gun\nThey immediately lose it on the little sister who hears the word gun\nAnd instantly her blood pressure goes up I could buy a pop tart into the shape of a gun and my sister would have a problem but the president has said he's going to sign something on bump stocks\nAnd if you are a fan of bump stocks than a I'm Sorry\nBut uh\nIf there if it's illegal to own an automatic weapon a fully automatic weapon I think bump stocks are skirting that law\nAnd I think we could win points with some of those uh ... folks\nIf we would say bump stocks are are good thank you disagree with me convince me\nThat's just one of those things that this gun owner the center a member is in lockstep\nWith the president or so that that's where I'm at All right that's a couple of things are going on today 'cause we still have\nA lot to get two for the midterms and I will give you my a plan for how I think the GOP can stay engaged and stay moving in the same direction towards the midterm because if the midterms were held\nA tomorrow or next Tuesday I think the GOP will have a good chance of maintaining control of the house and picking up a seat or two in the Senate\nSo there's a chance that if the midterms were held under the current conditions with the current kind of attitude that we have\nThat uh we won't see Speaker Pelosi and that's the ad I Would keep making is an ad with Nancy Pelosi with the speaker's gavel talking about taking way your your tax cuts talking about putting back\nSome of the regulations that Donald Trump has managed to get rolled back\nSo I think there's some are some possibilities there for us but it's just not Nancy Pelosi that's going to maybe save the house I think what we need to do and this is the Senate needing to stand up\nI think the Senate needs to step forward especially the Judiciary Committee\nAnd find out who leaked the letter from professor Ford who leaked the letter who was behind\nWell we know who was behind the dock sing of the three senators but I think we need to find out what was in the envelope that Sheila Jackson Lee handed to one of Christine Blasey Ford's attorney's just happened it happened on the same day\nThat the dock thing happened so I I think we need to see the Senate stand up and push for with some of the things that Grassley has been talking about\nInvestigating the people who perpetrated this fraud for the past three weeks that almost cost us a Supreme Court nominee and also did considerably damage the reputation of a good man and judge Kavanaugh\nThe news files on my computer I read about online

you hear me talking about how I didn't see it first I listened to it on the radio and then I watched it later I was more impressed after it\nWhen I watch the because I realized this GOP is finally starting to get his presentation act together you know the two women in the background the whole set up was just perfect\nWell you sound like an old Yankee Republican or that's what a what do you know in the past you know she she has been confusing but I mean today I got to give her credit I mean God Bless her just beautiful\nYeah I think she laid out a primary fishy case and why this guy deserved to be where he's going to be hopefully after tomorrow and why\nAll of the ... and hollering while it should not be listened to as a legitimate criminal charges but she also brought up I thought I really respect the case for the victim the alleged victim here not a victim of judge Kavanaugh but if somebody\nI I was so impressed lay and and I'm not usually as Susan Collins fan so that's a good now did you have a bad jingle to share with us\nOf course I Do I used to be the spaghetti ocean a commercial which one you got to go way back for that that's neat round spaghetti you can eat with this

pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how're you doing I'm ... yeah I Wonder\nI Wonder if I say that I think one of the reasons why this fish or ... or cheerful is because as we speak the truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump are so popular with people because\nWe're so used to all these politicians just here said he wants to be doing something else you know never followed up all sounds good come up to a lecture\nBut when somebody actually scripture in our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power before Trump that was a pretty rare thing and I think she tapped into that raised\nBy you know ... some of the consistency usually people look at the television and they're just like you know why\nOr why would why would you go back to a party you know ten times reader people the drug to raise stuff that everybody was out of common sense just has to say you know this is\nAn out of one thing I could say the media is so complex and I hope these people never get

enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\n[noise] yeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue in the election and\nI understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm going but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country until the same thing that if the Republican Party kids simply keep this problem is the most important have its promises then they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of share that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where my heart just can't\nStand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud and Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nUm I did the granite Fox is you know they give it a big huge hug and\nI've been a real critic of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never Trump hers and have come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises I'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promised that they kept their promised to support a constitutional is\nA Supreme Court justice than we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans\nAnd Trump supporters and conservatives\nMost of that coalition or or conservative I think that there's great promise now more problems than I felt a very long time\nWe're talking to match lab or I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also all over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC Matt\nUh if you want to tell me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle ...\nWell let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute here I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together when we had the majority in the Senate and when a mirror Garland was a pet for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together\nAnd that's why we're where we are\nWhen you're a hundred percent correct\nHe deserves credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that he has ... you know not done yet a\nTomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee ticket shepherd shepherded through the Senate and under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was just way to get the next book is an excellent could be replacing a liberal and a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick up ... millers autobiography and read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mole that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo I I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question\nYou'll have like five daughters un mercy have five young young daughters\nWe do we have five daughters have ...\nHow has this last three weeks been at the dinner tables in the ... house\nThat's a really great question because I've had a lot of pretty serious conversations with my two older girls one is a\nSophomore in high school um goes to a high school that's kind of a sister school to Georgetown Prep and\nThey all feel silver lined by the ah by the treatment of these Catholic institutions I think there's a real unacceptable or talk about Catholics of their institutions which were disgusted about and I've talked to my eighth grader and I talk to them how\nThey have to be careful out there with social media and drinking and of course boys and you know all these little lessons of life which are really important to know but I also ah you know what happens at our dinner table a lot\nIs because they see their parents on TV which they think is really kind of like ... deal\nBut you know you gotta fight and I'll tell you what Brett Kavanaugh taught me just last couple of weeks that I wouldn't have thought ... was this type of person as well as I Know he's pretty\nHe's pretty mild mannered you know he's low key\nBut you know what he did when they went to what the character assassination he fought back he fought back hard and when we talk about the around the dinner table we talk about that because they see their parents being criticized at the end we tell them that we're proud of what we do and they don't have to agree with us politically when they grow up they have to agree with us now by the way life is just mandatory\n[laughter] that would ever believe they won that we talk about\nThe need in a democracy to stand up for yourself and to speak your mind and I think for especially young women that's really important lesson\nWell it's important that they know they have that arrow in their quiver and also that it's not the first era you pull out every time\nYou know and I think having a show that he waited until he had to go there\nAnd then he fought back I thought that was a very powerful time and I thought today I did it with Susan Collins match slap I Can't thank you for taking time out of what should be celebrated or dinner night for you and your wife\nAnd I appreciate you for being a friend not only of mine but of this show and of the conservatism everywhere\nThanks Mike you're a good man and I got to say that God Bless America I think we have a great future before us\nFrom your lips got keep us going the right way thank your bat [laughter] we'll see you soon\nTheir egos match lap or if you've never been to sea pac\nWhich happens every year in the spring it's even in a non presidential election year\nIt is worth the trip if you're anywhere near DC and

an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes the salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I Would have said you're on your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe but no that's exactly how this worked out\nSusan Collins gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she give a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady decline for more than Thirty years one can only hope that the cabin a nomination it's where the process\nHas finally hit\nAgainst this backdrop ... and it's AT T H and intervention well senator to decide what the constitution said fights\nAnd consent to ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said that he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court\nAnd with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative to liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them\nSo uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today in your argument that she made her case was to talk about something that the left would not let us get through and that was the presumption of innocence\nThat if you were charged with something you cues of doing something in this country if we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence than it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nPrint some Senate venison since
