they are\nTrying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not failing themselves as the new Donald Trump's ... they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out\nAnd said the holder comments were bad that's her phrase that was being criticized writing but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service to civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to\n... what made them almost unbeatable was for the average\nPerson right they they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least tried to hide it this switch is\nNow overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic\nParty and it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not emulating Martin Luther\nKing yeah that was really the the ... that was his Vail mhm\nI mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back and they ... they would have followed Malcolm\nX.\nThings might have been worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nBack very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean people want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no 'cause you know animals harassing innocent people in a restaurant I mean that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people mhm right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who\nWho go down these roads ... you know the alt right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking is either they're horrible horrible and the people in the totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist right like there's very few people are like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you\nKnow and I don't know not to you know Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really outside of Steve Bannon you've\nSeen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even not seats that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I'll be ... there was an actual death in Charlottesville right now again everyone would ... say that that is horrific um but you know the mother was over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even

going to keep the Senate and they have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal save them and they they really going to all of a sudden you know just discovered that oh Russia manipulated this election certainly is that going to be the play it might be but I don't think they have any real belief that that will that will stick to that will work\nWhat do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain of Trump is racist Trump is a is a a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things\nBut what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president that they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you hook you'll hear on the left the worst president while time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed for that reason\nAnd it turns out he's doing a really good shop the economy is chicken but and I'm here in for a lot of people who know and this is their life's work has studied is that\nEven though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan would have called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better\nSome people have that a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying that as you get worse last Eighteen months and it has it\nSo what do they kill themselves what did they come away with and this then brings me to the outrage mobs anti fall and the uh you know the the the women's march ... creatures in the anti Kavanaugh hordes and the the stalkers\nBecause that's really what we're talking about these stalkers who are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them away at a Republican who put a block slap on some hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later\nBig high five\nBut this is increasingly looking like the last is gonna have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable\nIn terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can to stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from from reaching its its intended goals\nFrom doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it\nAnd I think that what set in with many of them is is not just have a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nIn the last must be telling themselves we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we couldn't at least get them going at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turned on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nAm more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month\nWhat does that mean for the left\nHow do they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative I don't hear it yet all I hear as rage and noise and anger\nAnd if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint to counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I Know that it will not be rational and it will not be in the best interest of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with Kavanaugh the very end of the nomination process\nIt's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture something\nThey will create whole claw some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough that they have a successful midterm election I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nBut I get the feeling that they must be cooking something up because they they never give you any sense despite the economy as strong as it is despite all of the different things you could point you that that has happened last Eighteen months just good for America period they never or reflective on the situation and an honest way\nIt's always Trump lied Trump cheated Trump is a liar and a cheat why haven't we seen his taxes he groped women without their consent why does he have you know such tan skin and and it's crazy orange hair and all this other you know blonde hair all that that they just hate him so much\nThey don't look at this for what it really is and I do think that the the rage mobster anger than ever because they are reaction to Trump's success they would like you to believe that they are\nAnd opposition force their hash tag resistant they stand up for Trump's but that's only part of the story the other part of it is that they are now inflicted\nWith self doubt they won't talk about it they won't share with you but how could they not be this was the man they said was incapable of leading incapable of running the federal government and capable of being a successful president\nAnd he is blowing away the critics right now that's got to be a strange place for them to be there obviously not adjusting well to it there have been sore losers from the start\nBut now I I think the Trump is living rent free in their heads in a way that it it's just going to get worse for that and I don't know where it goes but if they if they don't take it leaves the house\nAnd I'm ... I'm telling you that because what I have a cabinet I'm starting to feel like maybe we could pull out a surprise you eat in the you know the pollsters over at a you know five twenty eight or five thirty eight or whatever it's called now they're saying about twenty five or thirty percent chance the Republicans hold out that's not enough and\nI think it's a little higher than that too but we

Papadopoulos our vendors Juan\nNone of these people had anything to do with Russia collusion and yet we sit here\nAnd wait for this final report to give us the ... the ... and state outcome of this ... what a mess what a total mess I mean I can say this to bring us back to what we're discussing earlier in the hour\nUnder any normal circumstances of the American electorate judging this president on the merits of his presidency and therefore the party he leads the Republican Party by how things are going and basing their votes upon that\nBy any objective criteria\nThat we can point to the country is better off now than it was a couple of years ago\nTrump is a more effective commander in chief then Obama was the economy is growing more rapidly and has more more head re more room to grow even further because of what has been done because of the tax cut the deregulation\nAnd yet what has been the focus this whole time that that it's not the Democrats have been making these Ernest appeals about how they would better run the economy all they do is try to tear down they just play the politics of the attack dog all the time\nThey don't offer a creative solutions I don't what they offer you is more\nConstant nonsense about the Mueller probe what they offer is a continued national conversation on whether or not you know there's something in Trump's tax returns from Fifteen Years ago that would be so bad\nThey really have nothing and that's what\nI think is getting up so worried right now they just don't have anything to point to and say see we we've got this week we can actually make your lives better all they can say is Trump is so terrible that anything would be better than him by the way it was it today a Robert De Niro\nWas saying that a ... is a bagel O'Rourke in Texas\nIs going to be able to be Trump man I I Hope they try that yeah wrote a socialist who like lies about his first name to seem more diverse or run a socialist and and see how that goes for you that's really what they want though\nThey want somebody who's a young Bernie Sanders that is where the Democrat that's where the Democrat Party is right now\nAnd you know I I worry about this because right now the country at least half the country is pretty sober minded about what's going on and what's possible was plausible\nIf we have that big economic even if it's just cyclical and that's just the reality of having the fed so involved in a monetary policy running up these massive debts\nEven if there is a cyclical shaping the economy and it's just a downturn\n... and and if it happens in a certain period of time you know that's when all of a sudden\nI get worried that you could have a moment in time where it look at ... rock Obama\n... bomber was basically the most far left senator in the United States Senate and was able to win the presidency no small part of that was people are feeling economic pain they were scared and the Democrats were demagogue ing the crap out of the issue\nBut that could happen again so while I look at bay to an end his and his sort of fellow travelers the Democrat Party see what I did there are now\nI think that they're not really a threat to beating from but if we don't pay attention to the long game with the economy they could be and that that keeps me up a little bit at night that it gets me worry but ah we've got a lot more team you're back news radio eleven\nIs going to be getting in a ... major Fox News viewership and and the president directly plugging him that helps with their donations it helps with their brand awareness it's free media it's one of those things that the president or the president loves doing and relish is using the bully pulpit\nTo push candidate in terms of what he's going to say I have a pretty good idea\nThey he he's been having the same campaign rally now for basically the last two weeks almost every single night he's got one tonight he's got one tomorrow night he's had one I think five nights prior and it it just it's a it's an hour long its rockets he talks about the flag\nHe talks about his record North Korea he loves to bring people inside the room and it's just it's a very high energy environment\nYeah I certainly picked up that there is no low energy Jeb vibe at the Trump rallies that is that is absolutely the case of ... what are we what are we expecting by the way on on the policies on for for next week is there anything that that that you think is going to get up on the radar either from the White House side or do do we know they're really going to\n... or ... rather some of those documents Trump talked about that anything we should be prepared for this coming week\nYou know I I I don't think that there's much that we should look for just because lawmakers are all out on the campaign trail they were desperate\nThat last ... last night to push through those judicial nomination so the Senate could go home everybody's focused on re election that being said uh you know in terms of on reduction that's something I you know I've been asking a lot of questions about at the White House\nKnew at resident about that right I mean you ask them about the reaction to the oval\nYeah absolutely I I after a week before you did I say and and and I you know that's something that we've both been interested in but the issue is that he had he had to take the issue over to the inspector general and I asked Sarah Sanders about that and the last press breathing that we had and she refused to commit\nTo a timeline of before the mid term so for now I don't think we're going to be seeing anything in terms of those on redacted documents and I really don't expect\nYou know knowing the inspector general horror with\nHe he is is a very uh very cognizant of of dropping things and\nPolitically sensitive times and he does take quite a long time in order to do these reviews so it's probably not coming anytime soon\nWhat's the best part of being a White House correspondent be in the White House all those are\nThe best part is just being able to see I mean you can be they're up front to to to get yelled at by kid rock like we were yesterday or somebody said one of our what our colleagues where we were just standing there I mean you're you're standing there waiting for these people to come in and you shot questions at a\nAnd a ... somebody asked him Mr Iraq which I thought it was funny they called him Mr rock and he's in Mr rock are you going to fire or do you think Trump should fire Jeff Sessions he said he should fire all view before [laughter] wow\nThat's amazing so by the way you know usually as as a as a New Yorker and as a journalist I feel like\nYou've always got to take the um you know act like you've been there before attitudes all things so I I Would very rarely be like oh here's a here's a person of of prominence let me take a selfie with him I Would judge no one for going up the kid rock 'cause I have a selfie 'cause this kid right [laughter]\nYeah exactly it's it's it's like that's it day to day stuff that you know oh if Jim Brown is here kid rock is here\nUh you know Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski or you get to meet people and talk to people that you you'd never your wildest dreams would be able to and then at the other on the other hand you also get to talk to the president the United states and you get to ask him questions on the most consequential issues of the day so\nIt's got to be the most fun president in our history to get to have a conversation with him and I know you were in the oval recently I was the only reason I recently it's a it's like the Trump show you really don't interview him so much as you try to guide this this one man phenomenon as he is speaking\n[laughter] yeah it really is a force of nature and and it's like you said you you you you'll throw something out there and he'll latch onto it and then he'll he'll flip it around three hundred and sixty degrees and then go another one eighty and another direction and you you try and flip in Ninety two a little bit of where you want to go and you just see what a gift\nAnd that that really is exactly how you say it it's it's\nWe we love to tell you know and the press it it's just one of those things where you can always get an honest answer out of Trump and it's it's hilarious\nI think yesterday or two days ago somebody asked him\nAnd said have you talked to the Saudis about you know this current situation with this this missing journalist probably murdered journalist and he he just said I don't want to say that yes [laughter]\n\nWell you know who did you talk to you that I don't want to say but at a very very high level and he just started going into all of the the discussion there is is the most\nOh I see on TV that what we what

sort of the subject of quite a lot of jokes over the last twenty four hours I won't get but unfortunately I'm it's entirely true er which makes us to jail\nAnd is the pizza and the u._k. anything that
