F. A. B. I'm sue Daniels and all of a sudden I heard\nThat man was working there sixty ninth and Harrison in la vista this morning as police and an armed men exchanged gunfire that suspect twenty five year old Jonathan ... took off running into a house the homeowner held him down until officers arrived\nTestimony from Kavanaugh and a doctor for I ran into bought that day and it was raining crazy in Washington DC and that's kind of where we set up this week in felons yadda yadda yadda\nBut as I was there I stood inside the Senate office building and covered some of the protests and I asked or tried to ask Elizabeth Warren when she was going to take a DNA test and she turned and ran away wouldn't answer it got mad at me\nA than a Jeff Merkley of Oregon another Democrat was there and I asked him\nIf he didn't think Joe Biden statement on FBI reports about sexual abuse in sexual harassment because he said they they were not worth anything if that didn't hurt his arguments and he\nDenied knowing about it which is a lie and then he turned and ran away and I wish I were in D.C today I'm not I'm In the constitutionally protected free speech bunker in the woods of Delaware and I'm watching\nThe reports of the busloads and busloads of people who are headed to DC\nAnd I watched some of the marches around the Capitol today with women holding a pre printed signs and women wearing the shirts that say be a hero and the signs that say cabin nope\nAnd all the stuff that has been printed by George Soros funded groups are printed by planned\nParenthood by the way can we talk about Planned Parenthood opposing judge Kavanaugh don't they get a billion dollars or more in taxpayer funding I think they do I think it might even be more than that\nPlanned Parenthood gets a lot of our money gets money from me gets money from you\nAnd when I was at the protest last week a week ago Planned Parenthood it's set up camp\nOn the benches in the quad drained go inside the U.S Senate office building and they were working the room handing out free T shirts to anybody who wanted them three T shirts and they have pre printed signs\nThey also had stationary and directions on how you could write a letter to your a senator or congressman to tell them that they needed to be vocal about Kevin Oh and this is all\nYour tax dollars at work I thought I thought Planned Parenthood was all about women's health and I thought so giving away free T shirts to oppose\nA nominee to the Supreme Court that's that's really what's your all about it seems like we need to pull that funding back\nAnd I know some of you are going to say look Planned Parenthood does things really good things well Planned Parenthood does not do mammogram so anyone who tells you as Planned Parenthood did today\nThat are ... are all about breast health they might be but Planned Parenthood doesn't give mammograms they don't provide that so there's a little bit of ... there as well\nWe we have much to get into day well like I said we've got to talk about China\nGetting inside our phones and spying on us it it's not just um it's not just a Dianne Feinstein\nWho had a Chinese spy apparently all of us who have a cell phone or computer may have a Chinese spy or first call the night goes to a New Mexico the land of the rising sun Jeremy joins the conversation tonight Jeremy welcome to the buck Sexton show just due to my friends\nHas to do a first off how happy knowledge day by the way\nThey're happy attend for\nBig knowledge day [noise] um I I I really think that Kavanaugh is gonna be he'll be confirmed and all I wouldn't doubt it if there's going to be a few Democrats that that the Democrat leadership to just say go ahead and vote for him that way you'll look good in front of your people\nUm I I I really feel for professor Ford as a you know and and and that kept me off because they were mistreated by the Democrats if you look at her testimony especially you know about the the question about what she\nWas asked that you know\nWe have come come to you in California\nThe interview she basically was like I didn't know this nobody told me this lawyers after Democrats for not informed of this option they want it because they wanted her to come to DC and they even tried to tell her to say oh tell her that's attorney client privilege\nAs she was like no I I would've I would've entertain them coming to me and and answer their questions in California I think that she really did not want things to go public that she just had some recollection that she wanted to keep quiet\nThen the Democrats said this is something we can use to a store and she she will\nI feel very badly for her obviously if you listen to her testimony something happened to Christine for something happened to her at a party but she can't she can't put Brett Kavanaugh there none of the people she said were there could put in there\nThe story changed the dates changed the story about having to doorways at her house really doesn't hold up because one of those entrances was made for an office at the house so it wasn't about being panicked\nThe story about being afraid to fly doesn't hold up because she flew all around the world in big planes in small planes\nI Know that that if you're afraid of flying because my wife is terrified of flying\nAnd if it's for work or pleasure it doesn't matter she thinks if you're in that plane something bad is going to happen\nSo a ... if she truly had a fear of flying it wouldn't just affected in business relations affected in every aspect of her life so there's just too much there\nTo hang on Kavanaugh now did something happened to her yeah probably she was in a school where there's a lot of drinking and by the way\nWe'll get into the devil's triangle tonight because they yearbooks are really going to weigh into my conversations this evening I've done a little bit of snooping Jeremy Jeremy uh can I ask when you graduated high school\nI graduated in Ninety

people I I Love my in laws but it never acknowledge the trauma that happened they tried to sweep it under the rug and they didn't want to talk about it\nParents should not do that that was after\nWe got married and frankly you know start having sex and that ain't back up those those feelings mills heart things came back up and just the other day she got word that her cousin that she thought was not going to be getting out of jail anytime soon\nWas ... was released from jail a about a month ago and she's like why didn't my parents did she have like a mini panic attack so parents that are out there if you have kids don't be afraid to let them talk to you\nKnow it's going to the rest of their lives and they need to work on it when it happens in every time it comes up to be there\nAnd and

appreciate this audience it's a a brilliant audience without question you guys are engaged you understand we'll talk history a little bit later\nWe'll we'll talk about all that stuff but before the break we were talking with Robert who was bringing up some important points in Alabama\nAbout Kavanaugh and about the Supreme Court Robert thanks for hanging on you want it to make a point about what's more important\nYes if you look at the civil rights act in the voting rights act in sixty four sixty five you'll see a presidential what they've been doing to Democrats have been doing for over two years we had the courage down here they were all Democrats they weren't ever go damn voted through because\nThe senators had to go back to their states get reelected ... ... ...\nOh not a guest I'm I'm Glad they got past but they light foundation for which ... back then and they're using it ever since I was a reasonable hour they cannot care because it's just a second point if you're creating court judges through three\nIt's very tough their seventies type your\nYoungest show a story that she probably within the next six years\nThat would give Trump\nBecause you don't win reelection totally totally\nIf you base it on the economy and if we think James Carville for it's the economy stupid then yeah the the president stands a real good chance against one of the seven thousand possible democratic candidates who are being talked about to face him\nAnd this would be if Donald Trump get one more\nThis would be a landmark this would be total game changing in terms of moving the court to a more conservative or at the position than anyone could ever see so uh I'm with you on a think cabinet gets through what what did you think the vote was the vote counts going to be Robert\n[noise] is going to pass it's going to throw this uh the deciding vote as his leadership is the best advice pressed is ... ... ... ... ... case but\nThat's right that's right and he would he's there waiting to go he's got a little office off the side of the Senate and if you've ever seen it's kinda cool but thank you Robert appreciate your hanging hanging on got to check in with a Charlie in Ocean City Maryland Charlie\nYeah that's a just outside of DC the swamp plants\nI Know where it is a I spend time in Delaware so I Will occasionally wandered down to your part of the world's ... it's the miniature golf capital of the world isn't it\nYeah well they had a couple of courses on around the outside parameters well I I was mostly managers\nI I'm a golfer I Love playing golf my my uh followers on Twitter no my obsession with golf but I was driving down there two weekends ago we're at a gym show or something my wife and I had this we're going down the main drag headed to the convention center in Ocean City\nI said look at that's a crazy miniature golf course in in a block later there's another one then\nThere's another one there has to be at least ten on that strip\nThey've been there for years\nIt's crazy so where are you on the on the confirmation Kevin do you think he gets a he gets confirmed\n... your previous caller here right on the nail on okay this is going to be to decide or because of the stiff neck a Democrats just don't know what they're doing\nWell I I just\nThat's what that's what I wanted to call about because Trump\nThey usually do but he is he forced the media I mean he absolutely forced them\nTo put out what the ... a professor had said in the hearings which the media didn't report\nThey report it cabin all but they didn't report professor and in his rally in Tennessee they claim he mocked her but he didn't he presented to the people the entire case she had\nAnd he forced the media which they hate doing it but he forced them to\nOpenly discuss that\nYeah that was a tough call but I I Do think Lindsey Graham was fascinating ah yesterday at the Atlantic form when he said I Would have told them you're not helping cut it out and this is Lindsey Graham where was he a couple of years ago I like I'm I'm Glad he's there\nAnd maybe he was not presidential timber maybe Lindsey Graham was better as a as a wing man for the president because he certainly has done a great job so you think it's gonna be fifty fifty and do you think it's ... gonna be the vote now do you think\nAh here's here's a wild scenario Charlie\nWhat if Joe Manchin comes out Joe Manchin of West Virginia Democrat and West Virginia facing a really tough race in a very red state that's pro Trump if Joe Manchin comes out and says he's going to vote for Kavanaugh\nAnd that gives Susan Collins cover to vote no do you think that's a possibility\nWell she has to face reelection to yeah and from what I understand all four of the Democrats that are up for reelection are falling behind in their polling as of today\nBut they are and Heidi Heitkamp is said she will not\nVote no matter what so Heidi Heitkamp maybe throwing in the towel looking for her next job within the DNC or within the next administration if she thinks\nIt's going to be a Democratic president see down the pike so that's already a foregone conclusion mansion he doesn't know but here's the weird thing and and this is what I don't like when the Democrats do this I think this is disgusting there is\nA pool of money about two million dollars that they have gone to Susan Collins this is democratic money they've gone to Susan Collins and said look you're facing re election in a small state like Maine\nSo Kavanaugh got heat for that for that answer for confronting White House over his obsession with a teenager who may have consumed enough beer to vomit and then it got we went from ... to boot thing\nOr what have you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce a [noise] a refers to flatulence we were sixteen [noise] okay [noise]\nSo that went on for a while\nAnd and they were obsessed with the F word and I'm sure the senator has never heard the F word in his life sitting this this whole obsession with your books in high school yearbooks got me thinking\nSo what did I Do I die ... into the high school yearbooks as some of the people on this committee the Democrats on this committee\nI went and looked at Richard Blumenthal Da Nang debt\nThe guy who has a committed stolen valor in my opinion by claiming he was fighting in Vietnam when he wasn't\nHe uh he did serve this country in the marine corps reserves achieving the rank them sergeant now that's not really achieving there are a lot of sergeants I Know who did work hard but if you're going to college and then you're getting in the military they tend to make you an officer right out of the blocks\nSo Da Nang deck is saying that he was serving in Vietnam then had to come back and make a cheerful apology or this guy was a child of privilege was in a private school and are played on the tennis team and was on the swim team\nAnd then I started looking at Cory Booker Spartacus Spartacus Booker who was a football player in his school and if you look at the end Cory bookers senior page on on the uh high school yearbook\nYou can see Cory bookers nickname was sugar that's what he was known to the students in his high school sugar\nThat sugar low sugar can we find out what sugar means what does that mean because some people in the eighties referred to cocaine is sugar\nShould we assume that Cory Booker may have been doing drugs because his name was sugar and in his senior year your book quote Cory Booker has the phrase\nLet's go all the way so what's\nGoing on with Cory Booker what does that mean Cory Booker this is the guy who remember wrote the essay about groping a woman at the age of Fifteen the essay about stealing second amusing air quotes they're\nSo why are we putting the year books of all of the Judiciary Committee people up somewhere why aren't we taking Cory bookers stealing second Cory Booker Spartacus and ask him what does he mean by let's\nGo all the way he was grabbing Fifteen year olds\nAnd then made it to it there's your guy who's admit it there's a guy who corroborate zone damning testimony\nAre shifting gears in a minute here you know I Need to tell you about something important as important as this show important to you\nEspecially if you're a homeowner you know the FBI calls home titled theft one of the fastest growing crime so

may have caught this moment\nChinese Communist party is rewarding or coercing American businesses movie studios universities think tank scholars journalists and local state and federal officials\nAnd worst of all China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen\nAnd ... and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections\nVice president Mike Pence delivering a very serious address about China and why China is trying to do also going on in the background discussions with North Korea over what the next meetings going to be with Donald Trump and Kim Jong on\nAnd this part of the world is kind of important and meanwhile were arguing over high school yearbooks and ... and moving and God Knows what else\nAnd I think it's time we paid a little more attention to it so I reached out to a guy who I think is just one of the best in terms of understanding the region his name is Gordon Chang he's an author a columnist you see 'em on TV all the time he gets it a Gordon Chang thank you for taking time to talk to us today\nHow are ya I'm fine thank you and thank you so much for this opportunity\nWell I this is kind of an important part of the world you know more than twenty percent of the world's population\nA resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area but on us\nAnd I'm I'm a little tense or not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them but I think China is starting to get to be\nA a little bolder why why suddenly now are they coming within forty five yards of\nOur naval ships and trying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents or we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidence\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these um encounters\nThe the Chinese have been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder the one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that the navy released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing\nBack off you know under the current administration we're now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China\nAnd that's a good thing Soviet ... working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that and vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you haven't listened to people you can find it it's on line and you\nCan do something is Kiki is going to C SPAN and watching which I recommend 'cause I think\nVice president Pence has the potential\nTo be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations\nUh Mike Pence appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions and I I think he is a real secret weapon for this administration\nAnd that speech to me was welcomed now Gordon Chang if we're looking at China\nAnd like you said the bold steps that they made the bold moves they made this weekend and the things we've seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the tariffs\nIs this a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now as fragile um Beijing as pouring a lot of money into the uh the money supply in order to keep things going and and I think that the Chinese understand that long term they can't win a struggle with the United states\nAnd so what they're doing right now is trying to huffing and puffing and bluffs um the American public into caving I don't think that that will work but nonetheless um that's I think the Chinese reaction to this\nThe Chinese have been waging a trade war against the United states for a very long time and we've been sort of oblivious to it um but what the Trump Administration has done and what the president has done is say no we're just not going to accept any more of this and that's why we see these tariffs\nAnd we've got to remember these tariffs are for the theft of us intellectual property they're meant to be a remedy and China steals hundreds of billions of dollars of us are ... year this is completely unsustainable\nAnd it's great that the administration has said no we're not going to accept this grievous last year in Iraq we're going to do something about it\nWell I I'm a free trade guy but I started to embrace what Donald Trump is doing because I see these as temporary it's kind of a temporary punch\nAnd it's almost saying or we're going to get into a fight with you only because we know we can outlast you and so I'm hoping that ultimately Donald Trump's invasion of trade is a free trade but if it means he has to break them back a little bit I personally\nCan swallow that now let's let's shift gears to North Korea\nI have to tell you Gordon Chang I\nWas a little bit wary when Donald Trump came out and said he had fallen in love with Kim Jong un I never heard of president say anything\nLike that but I and and I'm not quite sure where this is going 'cause I don't trust Kim Jong own as far as I could even hope to throw in a boat where are we in this negotiation with North Korea\nRight now I'm secretary of state Tom tail is going to go to pee on young for one day trip on Sunday apparently he is going to be trying to set the time for a second Trump Kim summit the first one of course was in June\nUm there's been very little progress since June and right now I'm the Chinese the Russians and even the south Koreans are openly violating sanctions\nWhile I think myself I think the reason why North Korea is kind of stall on out and some of the other issues that we've had going on is because they're all waiting to see after these midterms if\nTrump is going to get impeached or add more problems because if that happens when they're in the clear\nThey're there they will find we won't find anyone else to put up there that can deal with like Donald Trump does and that's what they're open for\nThat are just getting her feet and waiting to see what happens in our media plays into that too because they keep her vote and all that\nInteresting thought gym but I Do think a diplomacy on this level takes time\nI also believe as I told some of my more liberal friends who are frosting at the mouth going we're going to get the house and they were going to we might get the Senate and we're going to impeach Donald Trump and then we're going to get them out and I say you realize that meets president parents will be a reality and if you think President Trump\nHas been tough on liberals and on on\nPeople who are sticking it to America\nWay to use the word President Pence would do and they were going to get him till we got a plan for him to so I'm not sure about that I just\nI think diplomacy on this level takes time we saw progress in the Russia situation today with seven more Russian soldiers\nBeing indicted now they're never going to extradite him here\nBut Donald Trump's been tougher on Russia than Brock Obama ever dreamed he could be tough on Russia\nSo uh I think it's about time and it's about Trump being blustery in his speaking and then the the uh the pragmatic approach has to go through all the steps of diplomacy to keep an eye and that you but thank him for checking in\nLet's ah stay in Pennsylvania and ah see what's on Felix his mind Felix welcome to the buck sects than shows her\nHey Michael hey I was a big fan of Howard Stern back in the bank and I want I Want to vindicate him
