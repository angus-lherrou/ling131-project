B.\nUh we'll now that I Know now that the seas are say oc for sale a\nTerribly as the male bombing suspect apparently a Trump supporter but still nonetheless what he said we proved to be twelve folk pipe bombs\nOr Democrats or course hopping all over the saying that all the soldiers all because of Trump's are heated rhetoric\nAlthough it should be pointed out that ah when it came to James Hodgkinson on October of last year\nWho had a goal of blowing away absolutely every Republican on the baseball field managed to shoot three fortunately killing none when it was brought up that that man was part of Bernie Sanders' campaign\nThe Democrats were quite virulent in a chastising anybody who would attribute a this man's motives\nTo anything that had been done by Bernie Sanders' campaign anybody who ever even brought up the possibility that heated democratic rhetoric\nComing from uh the the left had anything to do with Hodgkinson being motivated to do harm to others whenever that was even entertained is a possibility that was immediately slam Nancy Pelosi said how they even thinking how dare they\nSo I'm going to be very very quick\nTo shreds to pieces anybody who entertain the idea\nThat while on one hand we shouldn't have thought of political rhetoric having any motivation behind Hodgkin's and we should immediately considered Trump's rhetoric the complete reason a behind the actions of Cesar ...\nAssuming he's a founder to actually be the guy anyway without further do we have assisting and you'll planning an analyzing Stephen Nelson White House reportable Washington Examiner formula with US News and World Report Steven thanks for joining us today we appreciate it\nYeah they certainly\nNow you had a piece about the bombs possibly being a hoax and hope still could have been the case whether it was motivated from the left or the right the hook still could have been the case and it almost seems as if\nThat was still a very much what we saw a still is permissible still horrifying still frightening but these pipe bombs one after another after another we're proving to be really nothing more than stage props I'm your take on ...\nBut we don't really do that yet we're still learning about the suspect to was arrested today um I just got off the phone with his former boss um who is currently employed him to get mail stricter ah\nIn the nineties so are we really don't know what's going on in this guy's head we know that he of course had\nA a pro Trump stickers on his car or his former employer told me he you know just really couldn't find his footing in life that that doesn't really know what happened to him but that it it certainly didn't have the speed on the ground I guess ...\nRight now and what about my jokes the positioning of the two of because clearly of Mr Hodgkinson\nUh the one who attacked Steve ... unto others James Hodgkinson uh his elevator didn't necessarily go to the upper floors either um and when people entertained the prospect that he was motivated by heated democratic rhetoric as I said\nHe was slammed by the left or I should say people who are considering that were slammed by the left for even entertaining such a proposition however right now you have the left doing the very thing they condemned others doing or am I mistaken\n[noise] well you know I I guess things are usually more complicated than people who commit these kind of crimes aren't acting as agents of political parties are mainstream politicians um so I I don't\nI don't know that it was necessarily fair to blame a Bernie Sanders you know works blame Donald Trump it's people who appear to have an affinity for them to commit crimes\nThank you thank you Steve that's all I'm saying\nThere is such a thing as nut cases on both sides of the aisle but just because they're acts are are are egregious doesn't mean that by default the political perspective from which they ... is one that is enough itself the reason for set of actions and that's a reasonable thing to surmise is not\nA ... you know there there is here in Democrats and Trump critics say that uh his rhetoric about his opponents by contributed to something like that it's um\nWe we obviously that that's a theory I Can't be proven at this point we do if this man was in some sort of vulnerable mental state and you know we just ... you know I I I'm sure there's some way where that theory could hold up but it's it's not\nYou were not able to test it right now we don't we don't know anything about this guy really except for the few details were starting to learn about his employment and crew\nThe streets I'm so it it certainly is too early to blame anyone I except\nFor I don't hear what you're saying that individuals are responsible for their own actions I mean because otherwise by that measure we're going to say\nThat nobody could ever give a fiery speech again because some nut case out there might think of it as as grounds for bad acts and\nAnd and and clearly in a nation in which we enjoyed the first amendment in the right of free speech or we can't allow that to be the guide of whether or not we speak out the two ... towards others when it comes to inflame political passions what am I missing\nWell you you know there is a point where it giving 'em heated speeches he needed to cross the line and you know what people consider acceptable or you know not to invoke the ... fascism examples but you know I I don't think I Would say that\nI'm Hitler's blameless for you know his insurance committing crimes or you know ...\nPlaying list for the pilots that his supporters were committing I'm pressing Trump of course as it is very different case but um [noise] I mean I think there's going to be\nCareful before we start comparing Trump to Hitler anybody to Hitler and I say this is somebody who lost relatives in ... I'm not all you want to do that uh but at the same time I mean if we're going to look at heated political rhetoric I mean it would be in my estimation a a\nA an act of taking double standard thinking oh to the craziest of heights or if we're going to lose if we're going to focus on Trump having referenced the body slamming of a of a journalist\nAnd his smiling at it uh uh but then turn around and ignore people like former attorney general Eric Holder when he says kick the more we have a congressman Maxine Waters telling her supporters hey when you see Trump people that you don't like\nFormer crowd around them and push back on them which of course restrained people you're physically restrain them which is an act of violence because as as you know you're preventing people from the right to freedom of assembly I got news for you if somebody gets in front of me and restrained me and shouts at me and keeps me on the corner", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Battle Line with Alan Nathan", "city": "Omaha", "day": "29"}
