call you should've had a matrix for your debts did you do a chapter seven yeah\nOK should ever had a matrix for your debts and lifted all your debt to the best of you know I mean even if you didn't list of that it can still be bankrupted did they not put anything down for this long at all it\nDid it on I mean credit it as a student loan and we were under the impression there are attorney that it you know wouldn't matter whether we put it down or not I mean we start getting credit rating that\nDoesn't matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that

Love the titans but a lot of rabies too so hey the best\nOne was oh\nWell that day the best football team playing that but yet they doubted our guys would agree with that there was a bad day it was\nBut um so you you've done that travels or whatever she does from other NFL work as well as some of the other teams of cold and you're going to both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm ... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check was Fifteen thousand and I'm gonna get another one next week it\nWhat do I do ... how ... how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelmed money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents know how do I tell my friends know um should I go by this car almost\nAny names but there are some um rookies out there that had the opportunity to to to mentor and they're you know they they they're going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd that was the coolest thing was with the ravens I can say this was all of them signed up for every dollar a couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar play and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see that a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly um on average sucking the low end is about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they didn't know how to budget that so I'm just excited because I'm seeing them saying hey I Want to help\nYou know these guys are texting me they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about this you know it's just real cool to see the show and players want to be good on a field but they also want to make the right decisions off the field as well\n[noise] I was telling a leadership team this week when I was talking to a group of pressures we were with yesterday that aren't you can't attribute\nA life skills book to someone just because we're successful in one area or in starting to get a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there\nWell I have that I I I Would think an unusual question but maybe not I have a twenty year old granddaughter she is living on her own now um she was working fulltime tech more than fill time she had two jobs when she lived in the world\nBut um [noise] had to move and so she's renting a room for hours away from the Denver area and she was only able to get part time she is still making her bell\nShe does she does know about they ran the I I've been trying to get her into a class I Will at some point um and it says she does have a car payment cheese making that she's you know has room rental room she's making that [noise]\nUm but just barely as you can imagine on working at a rally as part time so uh the problem is that she is making it but now she just found out she has five not for about five wisdom teeth in her mouth all of which have to come out and we'll be Wellington that's why our\n... why did she move away from her income\nBecause um it was a dangerous area her house with being shot up her father's trapped with blown up at ... at a house on it with a life threatening situation um she walked into the house twice and it without being if people were in\nThere and I got that burglar I had jobs right\nShe had a job\nAnd she ... she moved so far away that she couldn't do that job when you can move out of the hood and move into a decent area and keep the job\nWell she couldn't find a rental in the Denver area that which within her range\nShe felt yeah I don't know yeah I don't do so in Denver at the very very expensive and kill area and so she moved somebody offered her room over in a lot of the faith\n... so so she got into a mess 'cause she overreacted and I'm jumped away from her income without an income set up on the other end and now she's dolled up well\nSee I I didn't have to tell you that the company she was working for promised her they will transfer to fulltime even their home so when she when they had told her yeah we'll we'll give you a full time day or two we understand\nAnd so she got there and all of a sudden it with a right now it's part time it will working full time but now it's like I got ya so she didn't she didn't move thinking she was having fulltime gotcha okay fulltime\nSo Bob are you asking should you help her with her waist and uh with some situation\nOh I Would yeah I I Will help her as much as I can with her weight and keep situation um is there any other ideas I mean what does money does the girl do\nShe's external that his yeah yeah ... ... jobs in my\n... you have to let her\nShe made the decision says he has to live with the consequences of that decision understand you want to help her as a granddaughter but at the same time as young millennials they need to start feeling the weight of their decisions if they make a bad decision\nMom and ground pirate grandparents should not come to help them out all the time I made one bad decision day my dad kicked me out the house\nAnd he said hey you're going to learn from that cost acquaintance because he knew that the only way that I could really become the young man that I was going to become so\nWe bought a ... I wouldn't help her as much I agree with ... she needs to get multiple jobs she left a good job I have friends in Denver I understand you're saying it's expensive but it's not that expensive to where she had to move that far away or for a good solid career path that she had going on\nYou know so until these people come in with a fulltime you work through the things you ... you know labor features you babysit your dog walk you do other stuff to backfill and and that'll get her where she can eat yeah and if you want to help her out what the wisdom teeth expense there's nothing wrong with that\nUm but I'm not going to go along with the idea that somewhere in this process she was forced right\nAnd she's a victim over circumstances she overreacted or circumstance gay and uh when you told me that that people cannot live in Denver because the rent is hot or there's a whole lot of people living in Denver proving you wrong proving yeah and um so you know you've got that ... you know\nShe just use that as an excuse and said I'm outta here I'm going to another city\nAnd did not have her feet solid under but work three four jobs and then the other thing comes in its full time job and you can drop a couple of those and maybe you can help her with the wisdom to help her make to make the\n... the turn their financially Ted is with us in Kansas City Hi Ted you're question for Anthony\nAnthony um [noise] I have two daughters they're both doing very well eighth and ninth game for four one K. caution neither one want anything to do is that they're both fabulous favors and we get ...\nI'm ... I'm the one is making a ton of money she's a welder she's on the road she saves money great and she's starting to do the four oh one K. is\nMy question is should I advised her\nTo just go to a Edward Jones or someone or or what are your piece or do her work ones and keep transferring now um\nDo you know for work with are matching matching her as well\nAnd and I that's the question is is you get the packets she'll she ... her to the welders your show Ron sites you can be there for three months she could be there for six months\nSo but they do all we send to the retirement pay for our country and have lead to get into that so I guess that would be the question if they are matching it would be worth the rolling it over every time she changes job\nTo exactly yeah yeah that's that's exactly right absolutely and then in addition to that on the side to the to have stability peace in their lives are just a Roth IRA ratio was a smart rush for pro and then they try each time but you're saying she's working short stance and so she's going to end up with ten or Fifteen of these little for one maybe four one K. someday\nShe could rights or should she each time she leaves well into their stable one she has\nYes yep yes always take your four O. one K. with you into a direct transfer roll over when you leave always do that um but they they technically or won't each one will technically be a separate account number but you can still look at the whole\nYou know your whole portfolio in one place than from all the different rollovers and stuff as you go alone so good question I Would question\nEighteen years old that's amazing that is amazing yeah that debt free welder she's making anywhere between eighty two hundred thousand dollars a year and already starting to invest in two or four one K. day that sounds like an everyday millionaire to me I think\nIt is like this is talk of the dad every day and he has said it's very good well he's taught him well I mean they don't have debt and um and they're not afraid to go to you know do a trade or a man trades are paying a\n... a day they're out there is a technical stuff and stuff like welding and in in the construction world and that kind of stuff the trades are paying big\nYou know you know Dave I just had the opportunity to go to the White House a couple of months ago and that's one thing that President Trump and his daughter talked about was we went to see that trade sealed active there so many jobs out there that are hiring and ah I agree with Dave that's that's a treat to go right now\nI'm well I mean if if you don't do college and you can do that yes there and if you do that you might not want it to college I mean it's it's you can go any direction you want to go these days there's a lot of opportunity out

know I see how their patients okay the acting like all of that the um\nThe mortgage and everything else all the bells and then I'm just I'm I'm there with my son I pay for my son I'm like torture for school and then like I I Try to take care of like you know find groceries and pay off credit cards mhm\nOkay [noise] so like my what my plan what to do is just to try and see what I'm trying to get back into politics cool again\nAnd I even tried to sign up for like a real estate license the you know just that's just for that to be like a side hustle mhm but it's like um I even thought of like trying to invest but then like you know not hearing from your shows and\nThe and you don't need to invest it and they didn't actually need to finish one of these degrees and get your income or you live in are you working fulltime\nOur crime okay why\nBecause you can hide behind your caring for your mother yeah well we don't like it it kind of like they don't jak all night my son in law makes it tough yeah I can imagine but\nYeah I imagine okay I'm Sorry honey you're going to let you got your plate full here's the say here's the thing I'm you've got to figure in order to have a career\nLong term in either one of these things healthcare management or pharmacy you're going to be able to work full time on a true yes how are you going to do that\nWell um\nI haven't really thought of it like you know future wife but like you know I I tend to focus on trying to um fish fish all\nThat well there is no reason to listen to reason to finish the degrees is to get your income up right yeah we're not collecting degrees you know the mom and her\nOkay we'll we only need degrees to be able to ... to make more money and you can make more money unless you're a bowl or you put your life in a situation where you can work fulltime and that means that you're going to arrange for other care for your mother aren't you\nYeah\nLong term not today but as you graduated from either one of these degree field in order to take advantage of having that degree you're going to have to be able to work I Am I wrong about that\nSo yeah\nYou know so I don't want you going into bed any further I don't want you\nAre collecting degrees just to collect degrees you say you did I'm heartbroken that you've got this close to the finish line on that pharmacy degree and have basically paid for it\nBut weren't able to finish it I Wish you could get back in line on that at some point because that's a hundred two hundred and fifty thousand dollar your job and your life changes dramatically and you've got the money then to actually hire someone to care for your mother but actually the money that she has coming in from retirement would pay for a caregiver\nUm you know in her situation than you may have to go that route you may not have another way around it so you just got to look at that and think about long term okay five years from today where am I going and step by step how am I going to get there the hundred and eighty thousand dollars doesn't scare me if you're making a hundred and fifty a year\nI Want you to pay it off really fast is really bad but it doesn't scare me it does scare

yourself in the corner here short term you you took care of your mom\nMuch there's a wonderful thing you did a long term or you're going to take care of your son\nWhich involves arranging other care

whatever number of years and so once you've got your emergency fund in place and your debt free then there's really nothing left to do with this money except three things which is what you should always do with money\nYou should enjoy some of it\nI'm a small portion of it not much you make enough with no debt to enjoy your salary or you should give some of any money that you have and you should um invest some of it and so the majority of this money\nAnd if I'm In your shoes is going to be invested and uh the ... the portion that you know you're going to leave alone you're pretty comfortable that you're gonna leave alone at least five years\nI'm just going to buy some good mutual funds with it I invest in four types of mutual funds in my retirement and in my long term investing which is five years or longer in growth growth in income aggressive growth and international\nI probably would set\nA hundred ... a hundred and fifty of this in something or a little more conservative than that that is growing some but I'm probably going to pull that money out in the next five years and buy a house with it\nAnd um you know something along those lines again it's not a requirement and I would make sure I was settled in you liked the um\nUh the flexibility that you've got now and I think that's a bad I mean I think that's a good thing uh I think you're on hold on to that flexibility for a while I don't want to look up and find your thirty five years old and still having not bought a home\nOr in especially in your situation 'cause you're in such a great situation so I Would give some I Would enjoy swimming I Would invest the majority of it\nAh some of it towards a home in the future maybe just a simple on index fund and asking the five hundred no load and there's no commission just let it grow um\nIt is going to go it's going to follow the market whatever the market does and then the rest of it I Would invest longer term than that just to build wealth with if you start at your age say with 'em\nAround two hundred thousand of this and you invest it you know and it sits there for forty years in grows a stock market rates of return which has been eleven point eight percent since it started ... you're going to be so wealthy is going to be unbelievable and it's a it's a wonderful way to\nUm honor your great grandfather's legacy sound sit down with a smart vest or pro is what I Would tell you to click smart ... dot com it'll drop down a list of the smart Mr pros and your area when you fill in your stuff you pick out one you like or two or three and interview them I don't care\nAnd go from there and sit down with someone and start to learn about mutual funds how they work what they are how to invest\nAnd I think it's good to have two buckets of investing here one with a five year mindset for buying a home and one where the forty or mindset for just becoming on believe a blue wonderfully wealthy [noise]\nUh I asked an is with us in
