have to work to eat yeah okay so I mean what if she just didn't want to work\nWell uh I feel like for her type of spending that's the ...\nI'm I'm sure like money mhm mhm\nAnd how old are you I'm Eighteen okay right\nWell there's a rule that we have discovered in these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother is not going to take an Eighteen year olds input\nOn her spending habits you don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering am I wrong no you're not wrong at all\nYou know it's just difficult now you know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you there's a couple of things um one is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend and do this and I used to do this and man when I got on this budget I got on this humble up system I got on this plan to get out of debt I'm doing so good and you just tell your story\nIs your story is not condemning her\nIt's just lose just holding up the idea that there's hope right\nTo tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad who could shut down a dog with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually yes my dad has talked to her he's actually one of the people that we should call and we both watch your show\nMhm okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny ah this would be

this there's a problem here\nAnd we sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life\nAnd we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save so that we have you know we live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you real cause you're he's got standing he's got a position in the household to have a discussion\nWhere as an Eighteen year old you don't and um it's not just not you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not whole or whatever I'm just saying in your mom's highs you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing\nAnd um you know he can sit down and if it was at my house on insurance I Would just sit down and we have a discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there was a problem and we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a long time and it's time for him to deal with it now\nThat's that's

journey what happened and and show other people how it's done\nOn right after we graduated we had so much in school that um and we just we need to get rid of this and and\nI grew up in a single family home that my mom worked really really hard and you know I wanted to say I want to take advantage every advantage that we had and get our you know get everything in line and be successful or yawn so ...\nAnd I felt entitled like I deserved a jeep wrangler and I work too hard and so we really were fighting and I just felt in title I was acting like a little boy and I needed to be coming in and I just knew I she deserves better and I just I had to you know let my pride down\nSo what happened what what was the breaking point what kicked it into gear because obviously you flipped hobbies and shoot the way she looked at you just then when you said that was a ... and it was it was really the way every man wants his wife to look at them know what you just did was incredible so uh tell me about that what happened well\nMaybe we just argued a lot and you wanted to have a very healthy and happy marriage and I just remember standing in the kitchen three years ago that he held my face and his hands and he was like we are going to get rid of fast and I think um\nWe just finally got on the same page and felt like we were connecting mhm um because you mentioned a lot that when your priorities are nine in your budget your priorities are aligned in your marriage and so for us that was kind of just something that was really important ...\nYeah and I just I didn't have any hope I didn't think we could do it what\nWhat ... what we got this we're going to do this\nWhat happened um I just I\nI think I just didn't want to hurt her anymore Mm hurting I Love her so much and I don't want to it just wasn't fair to her and I was the one who's spending money and going out to eat doing whatever I Want to do and so\nAnd I was hearing your not important yeah finally we're like we're the most important thing and I know and we need to get our finances in line and be on the same age in our our life moving\nForward and so at that point it's game on yeah and what what kind of income where you making at that point three years ago I think between eighty them about eighty okay so you're still come up from ... to one twenty five during that three years yet hurry impressive very cool so then okay you've made the decision were on the same page then what happened to\nMake a budget and it kind of\nIt was I felt constricted at first and then I kept listening ratio and it's like almost like gave me permission to spend money and I felt safe to spend money it wasn't like oh this is going to cost me a night on the couch and felt like okay we're on the same page and I felt an acting more when I found this happier and I was like you know what stuff doesn't make me happy anymore and I don't need\nA jeep wrangler I Need new clothes and they don't need to go out to eat like I'm just happy this is more important than anything else and winning traction yeah and then I could see the light and adrenaline rush off the attraction for like I did I was like we can do this and I'm like okay we're going through the kitchen sink I'm selling stuff I'm I don't care what kind of car drive so yeah wrangler gone\nWell there you go you're under funding it automatically them so that's perfect yeah yeah I Would I Would put the whole five thousand through there which is going to save you about Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nThat's a nice benefit death and I thank\nThanks for the call Anders next in Canada hey Andrew how are you\nAll are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] cage so we have just recently paid off our house and yeah so we are completely debt free and I just wanted to ask you a question about next steps okay\nHey so we live in a two bedroom\nTownhouse pretty tight we have a family of four and the one on the way\n... so we\nAre a moral case here for a little while but in the next few years we want to\nSave up and pay cash for a large good\n... so my income is roughly a hundred thousand a year my wife now that she is on maternity leave really making anything\nIs she going back to work she won't be no okay so you have a hundred thousand dollar household income watcher townhouse worth\nTwo hundred and forty to fifty and when you move up what what price would you move up to\nRoughly four hundred\nOkay she and a hundred and sixty thousand it's gone up in value during that time so you need a hundred and something thousand dollars how long is it going to take you to save a hundred and something thousand dollars\nFor our question is I I Am a wave the Fifteen Percent a month long mhm on my employer nachos four percent of them\nSo we have the Nineteen percent [noise] ... that's going Ninety percent of my income that's going to retire mhm my question is would it make sense to go back to three baby step three D. no and no you know\nWhat a what is your age\nUh I'm thirty and my wife is cleaner okay\nWell you got plenty of time you're going to be OK I'm into here here's what's gonna happen during the next three years five years whatever it is your income is going to go up and the value of your town house are going to go up or slow value of what you're trying to buy is going to go up to right but it's so we're not dealing with a fixed\nItem to do forecasting with the fixed item your your income is not fixed it's you and you're going to see some increases and the value of the town houses not fixed and of course your target is not fixed\nUm and so we don't know exactly where you're going to end up there\nBut um no I I Would stay at Fifteen Percent if I were in your shoes and then I Would just save aggressively I Would take extra jobs any other money that comes your way inheritance is bonuses anything else the role that in the house fund don't consume it anytime you can get your hands on anything just do it in the house fun though in the house fun though in the house fund\nAnd um but we know if you save thirty thousand dollars a year\nThat in three years and some change you'd have another hundred thousand but with this town should almost be there so I think your three I think you've got three year plan you might have a four year plan something like that while doing the Fifteen Percent but it's going to\nThe tide will be a tight budget to do that but you got trashed by not going to send you back into that you know that and you didn't have to go back into your smart man Cindy's immobile Mississippi Hi Cindy how are you\nHigh for a Mobile Alabama I Would\nThink so I'm looking at killing going where are you from woman okay how can I help\nWell we're new to the financial peace University We're entering our third week and my husband is the fiduciary for his brother who passed away he was one hundred percent disabled veteran and he left quite a large estate\nMy husband has an attorney immobile who is I'm taking it to the court or at least to six months and then it'll be distributed and um my husband I'm just concerned that the Veterans Administration will come around and in any day or maybe three years from now and say no we need that money back\nBecause it wasn't used for my\nMom and I don't know ... money that came from the VA is right in the hugest state yeah so they gave him a lump sum due to his disability\nYou know he was one hundred percent disabled in every month he received money from the Veterans Administration and has been paid all his you know care bills and everything like that mhm\nBut because Mike would give it away on the first day he got it the Veterans Administration have been a a family member to walk over his estate and some of my husband's doing that for Twenty years oh my lousy so the state great\nRestaurant it's not they're not going to come after that they're not paid paid a disabled veteran for being ... and yet a family member managed it well for the good of the veteran who has now passed they they've got no standing whatsoever to come after that okay All right no I I think you're fine is your husband\nThe show later\n[laughter] no no he had written a wheel with my brother my could very well with my husband's help to give some to his nieces and then distributed amongst is dividing brothers and sisters to\nSo much was the ...\nI think it's around two hundred and fifty I think each of the three siblings are going to get Seventy and the driver five six nieces will get ten thousand each from I'm not really sure there's also some gold coins\nYou know your husband is a good man and he\nWas he was very much and we ended up taking my to all his Veterans Administration appointment at the last years of his life because the VA healthcare was not a ... cent unless my cat a representative there because like this one hundred percent disabled\nHim we miss him now that I'm back in the money\nYou know definitely definitely but

interest right the policy holders of about four to five percent supported by higher interest rates\nSet by the federal government during this time but a decade of rock bottom interest rates in the wake of their financial crisis hurt insurers profitability reducing the return on the bonds an underpinning their products and so they jak the right so\nHere's what happens with a universal live policy why these things are happening why people are pissed off about it so you're told that if you pay a premium you'll have the policy of your whole life a portion of the premium goes to pay for the insurance and a portion goes into your investment called the cash value\nThe problem is these things are based on the insurance inside of them is based on an A R T which is an annual renewable term\nIf you think about it every year you live you're more likely to dodge statistically forty six year olds more likely to live to die statistically than a forty five year old on average Seventy six year old is more likely to die than fifty six year old on average statistically speaking so they charge more\nIt costs more because of the probability of death to ensure someone who's older or by get that and so if the let's say you had a hundred dollar a month or two hundred dollar a month premium okay and if it started\nOut at age thirty five\nAnd the cost to cover you at age thirty five was fifty dollars a month of the two under then you'd have a hundred and fifty going into investment that should be just fine right but then what happens is over time\nThe cost to cover you let's say let's let's get you up to age sixty might be two hundred and fifty dollars which you're only paying two hundred\nFifty dollars coming from eating your savings up that you put in\nAnd so your insurance costs goes up every year to the point that it passes the premium it eats up the savings when the savings is gone the insurance company comes to you knocking on your door and says now\nIt costs three hundred dollars a month for you to just have insurance no savings\nBecause not only have as the increasing premium or eaten up what you were paying or the increasing cost of insurance eaten up your premium but it's also going over that eaten up your savings now there's nothing left and we're not going to cover you anymore unless you pay this new higher premium for insurance\nOnly huge is God's
