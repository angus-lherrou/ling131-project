[laughter] oh mushroom process you know keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter]\nSo ah ... the deal is if it's a cash value life insurance policy there are three types of his whole life universal very more universal live and just verbal life\nAnd a universe alive or variable universal life and the variable universal sometimes has a mutual fund selection inside of it there's years\nYes enough yeah okay and so what happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it because you're not seeing good return\n... no it's about eight percent returns but all the fees built into it I think eat up that it not more yeah yeah\nAnd you usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve\nDon't that somewhere in the seven range after fees which if you just bought the mutual fund you might have made ten or twelve and your case you're making eight and their fees are getting your down probably in the four range actually will be my guess usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying a mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking you in the teeth to the tune of another four or five percent that's where it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable term\nAnd uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy his term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then it adjusts up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year for one year it's\nNot the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year so you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain is doing poorly okay uh-huh less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs just increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[noise] I have not okay and uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and gives you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat make sense it does plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it\nSo it's a horrible plan when you die [noise] but uh it's just really bad while you're alive and it gets really worse when you die so what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage into your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just did that just ready to get re upped and this also means you're probably need a new financial advisor\n'cause I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial advisor it's certainly possible [laughter]\nSo it sounds like the way it doesn't sound like a most of the people in the mutual fund world don't sell this crap\nI say that I Am ... and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them do sell this crap because nobody believes in the garbage except the life insurance people nobody anymore nobody there is no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces as by whole live life insurance or by cash value in terms of any kind of there isn't one out there\nThere are just the cost of math is just so horrible and you figured that part out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and hadn't a pea under shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you ever understood at that you'd drop it and him to probably so I'm thinking you need a new advisor and you need to get some term insurance in place and you need to drop this garbage that's what I Would do\nThanks for the call brother open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five just making friends in the insurance

think that they get fired with having to back it and having a plan together and they think into that plant\n\nAnd I'd say for for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the willingly left and the fact that um\nWhile before we met and I can look back of my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met and we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nYeah that's ...\nYes yes and are very bad on that money\nYou know just ...
