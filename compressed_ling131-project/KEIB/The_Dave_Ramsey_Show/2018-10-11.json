twelfth amazing\nYou're talking about the building you know the practice itself on sale I have a\nI have a hundred thousand have in ... and the practice it'd be five hundred so it'd be really tough to scrape together and other four hundred thousand dollar\nIn a year I mean if you could ever get tied up for a year and close it lets you know uh and then by the real estate the second year more than a year lease it will for the first year and Lisa so here's the problem I I heard one I'm struggling with you but you haven't obviously have a ... be gleefully fabulous income\nI mean crazy wonderful income but I Do not tell people to borrow money to buy businesses\nAnd I'm not going to tell you to borrow money to buy this I think you can save up the money and a year\nAnd I think it'd be just didn't you know negotiate with this guy put together a deal and\nEven if you um took it over ran it for a year and I had an option to buy put a hundred thousand dollars that down as your option to buy the practice and then clothes on the practice in one year in cash for it and close on the real estate the next year and pay cash for it and that's how I Would do it if I were in your shoes um\nI Do not borrow money mark and I do not tell people on the show to borrow money for business purchases\nUm I don't believe in it I think it gets you into problems and I'm a you know if this guy wants to sell this ... this practice to you that child will have to sell it if I were negotiating the deal\nBut I mean certainly you can do what you want to do I think that practice um you know I suspect it's going to even add more to your income and then in the third year of this discussion you can probably pay off your house I didn't ask what your mortgage balance was but um\nI don't go into debt to buy to do business\nWith this business has too much risk with it an even dental practice is too much risk with them especially when you're completely changing the format of what you're doing in that you're picking up a whole second location and practice management comes into play them\nAnd so there's risk here there's a real risk here\nI'm so I'm paying cash for it or I'm not buying it and that's how I Would go about it a good question I don't know what you'll do a you certainly got a lot of income and that that covers a lot multitude of sins\nBut that's how I Would do it thanks for the call open phones at Tripoli eight to five five two to five uh Melissa is on Facebook and Dave Ramsey a Facebook dot com ... what exactly does it mean if the term insurance is Twenty years I'm forty three\nShould I go for longer or shorter term\nWell that means that policy will not change for Twenty years\nIt's called twenty year level term and you'll have the same premium and the same amount of coverage for Twenty years after Twenty years the premium will go up dramatically um or you can go have another medical exam and buy a new policy that will not be\nGo up nearly as much as that one would go up now the question is how long do you need life insurance\nIf you've got a six year old and a twelve year old in Twenty years you don't have a twenty six year old and a thirty two year old hopefully they're gone\nThat's the idea we train them to leave\nAnd come back with grandbabies that's their job okay that's the process here this is how life works so kids are grown and gone Twenty years from now you would be a hundred percent debt free because we never tell you to take out more than a Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage\nAnd Twenty years from now if you were doing the baby steps that we teach you'd be putting have been putting Fifteen Percent of your household income away for Twenty years which would probably make you well in excess of a millionaire\nDepending on what your household income is so let's just say you have seven\nHundred thousand dollars in them paid for house and no kids at home\nYou die I think your husband could struggle through\nOur reverse it he dies you could probably struggled through seven ourselves hours no kids who don't want to pay for us to the point is being out of data building well does away with the need for life insurance you don't need a journal life they only live live in rooms is needed is 'cause your age and needs to commission his whole life this is the Dave Ramsey show\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance\nSince has the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not

I mean that's a lot of house that's good yeah we got it on sale yeah good for you [laughter]\nI like it was this in calm and no debt in the world as young as you are you guys are killing at yeah we don't know what to do with ourselves now gas we've always had\nYou know the nice thing about following your plan there's always one step at a time and\nYou always have a goal that you're working on and now that we're like done we don't really know what to\nDo next [laughter] shopping some invest some of the ... about all you can do it on an oil done you know\nWas it feel it's really awesome a it's a long time coming it's a lot of planning but now it's just you see one bill go and then another bill go another bill go into more power comeback one month in another month another month and it feels really good cool what do you teach a law oh good\nOkay so a law professor and empty\n... not bad to have a long way to go it was a lot of work to get to where we are bad\nAnd ah I think you know coming out of medical school it's um you you have this big want that\nIs that you know and I remember getting statements in the mail from the loan company and I would just kind of open them and put them and put him to the side because it's so overwhelming you know and um I I was nervous about having\nTo make an Eighteen hundred to two thousand dollar payment every month for ten years and then end up paying almost double what I'd have borrowed ... and it's basically like paying off a mortgage so um we were\nWe actually had a great I'm attending physician that during my fourth year med school actually sat us down and said\nYou know we're we're going to talk about money and we were thinking oh easy and it teaches about billing or how to run a practice and he's like no Sunday you're going to make a lot of money and you need to know what to do with it so you don't end up like me and my sixties and I can't retire because I\nBecause I have that still wow um and so he's he's the one that I heard your name from and got the total money make or a book and read that and\nI'm probably was another year or two before I really started the program 'cause\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out how you're going to pay out that while you're taking out ... ... um and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want it to start or marriage off rights or we wanted to sort of gotten the same page ... or ... or what have you with a sort of what our future was ...\nSo how Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of the evenings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five thousand now that\nI'm into I think I really don't see doing that girl a minute ago yeah yeah\nAnd our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I'd like to go to this class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and I'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged\nAnd so we got married August twenty twelve and so to this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd you an end\nExactly in the last two and a half years yes okay\nSo here's the thing we know about putting miles on a car and you know this is the more miles you put on the car the more you destroy its value correct\nCorrect and so if I'm going to travel um or for instance people who travel for a living people road warriors I call them they you know there there have to travel for work all the time I'm In that case you want to drive in that case you want to drive the least expensive vehicle to get the job done because you are destroying whatever you drive\nI mean you more and more grab a hundred thousand dollar car you is going to be worth nothing by the time you've finished traveling\nAnd show 'em unless you've just got millions of dollars you can afford to lose a hundred grand but but you know most people don't have that so basically what we're saying is you're going to take the Seventeen thousand our vehicle and you're going to cause it to drop in value faster than anything else what's your household income\nUm I make about eighty thousand until you're single photo bachelor right through regular small okay All right I'm always hanging out you have any debt or just the car that's ... ... um eleven thousand okay\nAll right well there's nothing you know I'm hearing here this crazy as long as you realize that you know the Seventeen thousand dollar car might be worth um you're going to lose a few thousand dollars extra on it just because you're going to travel in it okay\nAs long as you're willing to do that with the kind of money you make you should be okay let's get the car paid off as soon as possible so your preferences keep it in drive it is that right\nOr my publisher to keep it for five or six years yeah but my friends and co worker whatever the fate betray they're going to try to get crazy to keep it to trade it in for what um last night on I I was sitting around the brand new BMW for forty uh-huh exile falling in love with\nRon well that'd be easy to fall in love with that but the but that's even more expensive so we're going to destroy even more expensive car if you want to travel and that right\nYeah and to upgrade to a brand new one you know that would be twenty percent less\nWell number one they're in there and you don't have the money to do that so that's ludicrous we wouldn't do it on that basis alone but on the idea that you're going to travel and I know you don't want to you know you don't want to upgrade and destroying more expensive cars about how you\nShow if you if you're gonna travel you need to run the wheels offer something that's not going to cost you as much\nSo we don't upgrade in order to lose more money when we don't have any money that that doesn't make sense at all so whoever your friends are I mean they're they're encouraging you to do stupidity but I've had friends that have encouraged me to do to ... I didn't have to do it though uh Brian's with us in Bakersfield, California hey Brian how are you\nBetter than I did the day how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nOkay they saw before I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased say ridiculous car [laughter] and as soon as I found you I was like crap\n[laughter] off what'd you bought\nWe bought a two thousand fans came off the sex with all the bells and whistles\nSo we eat yeah\nWell not for the sake of my pocket her yeah well I guess but I mean the cars great now okay All right yeah so what we're all on the ... thing\nWe'll thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your house and I'm\nHere won't be making sixty sixty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my overtime oh yeah those are just argued on you know\nSo and I'm next year I'll be getting a Fifteen Percent right plus and other factors that rate down the road yeah I'm so here's my age I'm calling to see if you work if you're OK with is a memo I finally agreed to let it go\nGood and sell it good it's worth Twenty one thousand oh God yeah she ... down into it or die that bad\nYeah and I that that it only took like three months good lord so Twenty one guy on trade in\nYes uh well I mean you know twenty three on private sale\nSomething that that's not enough to spread on private so she sent his car went from thirty five thousand uh twenty three thousand and one year\nActually technically it was forty thousand two thirty five thousand I I also canceled the warranty on it\n'cause we had a extending warranty yeah and and we found out that it's funny how when you pay off vehicle already reached ... miles all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and for chief counsel Africa you or did it\nThe cars one of our old\n... and I almost a year old\nYeah All right so yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nFinance or me and my wife is looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could say about that money and I already have it by next thank um refund\nBut what I was thinking is because our monthly payment at the throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars so because I also have a student loan and assume payments like one sixty eight but almost done with that we have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what it what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm bottled a difference and then go to the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars and just make payments off for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making a mess\nMhm yeah I mean we okay with that yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing the your second car\nThe money by on just on\nThe five thousand dollar car there you're buying how are you financing it\nI'll just go ahead just like you know just like you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your debt by half\nGray\nUm by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting the carpet often\nAnd getting the whole that your dog with this other car which is absolutely horrendous to great car I'm surprised that thing just dropped that foreign value I'm sure you got your numbers right on that\n'cause I I mean I [noise] the\nCars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a card guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like it that's incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding his values so check it out and make sure your number your numbers are a little high\nOn terms of lost money I think you maybe you have a loss as much I'm hoping you lost as much as you'd think you've lost so let's dig into that a little bit further and you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to sell it private sales it should be in this situation about five thousand dollar difference\nIn other words you should be able to get five or more out of showing it private show than you would for ... on something that expensive I'm so really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but\nWow what a dad gummed kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing\nAnd good luck with it but yes I Would get out of it for sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking I mean there's nothing good and the story thanks for the call [noise]\nSo that puts this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books thanks for hanging out with this American Dreams childs

Tennessee Hi Josh how are you\nMaking your taking my call ... speak with you too sir how can I help [noise]\nWell I have ... about a ... a ... about a nine thousand two hundred and thirty six pounds a hundred thirty six dollars or from school debt\nI'm from an advanced degree and just kind of really looking at the best advice on how to pay that off I Know that you're not a fan of the public service loan forgiveness program and I'm\nI'm just wondering maybe about income driven plan where the government might take it for than of unpaid interest monthly or ... or just go ahead and getting down to knock out quicker you can\nKnow the third one is about one year we added up faster that way what your income dropped\nNow after taxes that bring home about physical workout change\nWhat do you do for a living\nI'm a nurse practitioner at a nonprofit hospitals here\nOkay my um saint Jude okay cool her actual wonderful wonderful place\nUm the um well I don't know whether\nYou can pick up extra time there or not but with a ... nurse practitioner you're very marketable when you can pick up other times you can work as much as you want to work as much as you're able to work logistically\nUm and I would get out and and I would just try to pay this off in about two years and be done with it instead of monkey around with some kind of a government plan here's the problem with the public service loan forgiveness program it isn't happening\nLast year thirty to thirty thousand people put an an application for their loans to be forgiven\nNinety ... Ninety six people were approved so I mean that's those are the odds you want you know I Want I Want to wait ten years only to find out that the government's scam me basically\nSo I'm not I think you just work like a crazy man pick up as many hours as you can pick up the great news is you're nursing I mean it's just a wonderful career path because you can add hours or add you know\nPick up some he our time or whatever you need to do I don't know on the short term when you make sixty thousand dollars extra money so fast his firm believer in two years you could just make sixty thousand extra you know I'm again you'll be working a lot but it just be done with it and just you know I'm\nA I'm I'm a band I ate all fast guy I mean just get it done I take the pain and get it done and then you can get on with the rest of your life and you've got you got to go again a great career track so you're going to be in really good shape\nThank you Josh what you do a saint Jude good stuff All right Tim is uh weather's in Binghamton New York Hi Jim how are you\nA Dave how're you doing better than I deserve how can I help [noise]\nOh well I have a quick question I'm about three hundred dollars in debt among or twenty five\nAnd my car is about to go where I'm trying to also save any pay off the debt as quick as possible to a question is is right now I'm putting seven percent of my paycheck\nIn my four one K. shed doing all that down to about ... ... it just started throwing money at this loan right now I'm doing about a hundred dollars a week at it you know just to get it knocked out as fast as possible but I was your opinion should also thank you for so much I you know you\nCan tune videos and lifting your show you've helped me avoid a lot\nOf bad decisions like buying a crappy hours and going into like a twenty thousand dollar car loan show I really appreciate that\nGood so well thank you um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "11"}
