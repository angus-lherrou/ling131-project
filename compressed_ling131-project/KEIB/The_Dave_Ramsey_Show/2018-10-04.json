offer you don't have to say it but you know what the number is correct\nOr we're not quite there yet okay\nWell we'll get even more so let's say that it's a very attractive number\nAnd I want you to say okay they give us a really attractive number that raises my eyebrows and then I Want you to think or if they do what they say they're going to do and you stay around for a little bit but then eventually you're out\nIf you get the number that makes you really excited but you know that it's possible that they push you out at some point in the near future and you are just left with the number and memories\nAre you going to be okay with that I think that's what Christie simply that it's really shiny and it should be shiny I think there's a lot of shy but let me ask you what you want is that why you cool with that\n[noise] you know years from now if you would be cool with that [noise] [noise] yes I think I Would be okay when you know hey you got to go with your gut on the one that's the thing is like in business we would love for there to be an absolute formula that says this is always right\nThis is always wrong there's black and white and are certainly some of that but a lot of times as business owners were making a value call there's going to be rescued away\nEither way you're going to take on risk of okay I'm going to sell it and then I'm Out like I'm Out forever I'm giving up this baby I I'm getting up ownership to what the growth could be in the next three to five Fifteen Years or you could stay with it you know like men there was a risk where I gave up that awesome offer the shiny things so\nThat's the thing in business you're you're really asking Reuben I think of value decision of what do you want what's in line with your goals where you want to be in three years you want to be sitting ... think dreaming about something new with that\nAwesome I'm Out in your bank account or do you want to be in the business and you actually taking credit for all that growth both both could be great it's really up to the ribbon it's your business and try to\nGo with your heart run the scenarios use commonsense goatee heart let's go to Adam is on the line in New York New York Adam how can we say\nHey guys thanks for taking my call so uh I'm In a career very started career you can income wife and I hate all pretty much all of our data the house and it's coming to the point right now where you know I had this idea for the past Fifteen Years and\nI don't know where to start to kind of watch the business ideas so what it is is I'm looking for a pet currently public place that offers food and beverage to you know bringing the community together um found a prime location um landowner one two hundred thousand a year for a week and basically it just kinda [noise]\nI Know there's a demand out there for it I reached search but from there don't even know where to start\nHow would you monetize this is the sale of the food and beverage is\nYeah so it would be failed food and beverage or along with kind of like a membership fee to get inside the crime is\nJust so you can drink\nWe are like a mix between it's a mix between like a like a gym membership and public dog park that offer just you know unlimited access to the facility but that also food and beverage is for a book\nOkay I've got a question for you for this market 'cause you said you've done research you said there's demand for it for this particular particular market that you're going to serve that's going to pay this membership fee and so on what problem or you solving for them through the fitness\n[noise] so in the area that I mean right now they don't have any type of public access dog park for at least twenty five mile to a private effort out rather than calling\nSo this is a dog park meet food and beverage meets tech\nYeah So Adam she's asking the core thing there is no place to take your dog isn't that the big ... you you there's no place to take your dog to run around there's no public dog park\nThat though there are um but what the town does is they are constantly lemonade eighty hours of access or anything like that so this is kind of just a blend between all three I'm primarily yes dog park\nUm but then also it kind of like a gentrified type of situation where you know if I Want to go there and have some type of craft beer or food\nTruck style food um you know all that is on crime is\nI say here's what I meant challenge us Adam 'cause I Know we're running short on time\nI I don't think your idea is bad and you seem like you've done your research and I totally get this I can totally see hipsters with their dogs and their laptops eat and drink and expensive ... like I can totally see what I Want to challenge you to do is think of a one point of arson that that can point out version\nI Want you to think of what is the lowest lowest hanging fruit what is a way to baby steps your way into the business without the risk and the commitment of two hundred grand that you may or may not have when the demands may not be there yet\nHow can you start this up on the ground floor organically in a local park in your backyard or really unimpressive version\nTo justify it get some revenue coming in before you take the next step I just want you to prove the idea before you take out some raskin cost and that type of thing so I just want to challenge you what that's the big dream what the baby version of that dream that you protest first\nThat's really good advice this is an idea I don't know it's a good idea but I got to give it to this might be a thing where you start to sit down with local town leaders and go hey we need a full public\nPark just for like ... no limits none of this stuff just anytime you want to show up your show that's meeting the first need then go hey what are the chances that I could get a license to sell so that you got to buy stuff that was at one point or you gotta start getting mines in the root cause the two hundred\nThousand dollar amount it's hard can to get people to pay for something they set for free I don't know what it's like in New York but in Tennessee dog parks are free so\nI think if you sell the food and the drawl of it all yeah but people have a free paper hanging out to get food they don't have a membership I don't know I just got to understand what problem yourself informed as good like hey Christie right thanks so they don't want to thank our producer James child there assist associate producer Zach Bennett and of course you America thank you so much for\nThe day range

bank\nA bank is owned by stock holders that Wendy bank makes a profit and they should make a profit we want them to make some profit\nWhen the bank makes a profit the stock holders the owners of the company\nYet that profit basically I mean if if the\nDispersed in the form of um dividends or the value of the stock has increased because the bank continue ... whatever it is but basically the owners of a bank are stockholders and that's where the profit goes\nA credit union is operated more like a cooperative\nWhere the owners of a credit union are there it's actually not for profit technically speaking and um the not the owners of the credit union are the credit union members which are also the customers\nAnd so as a customer of the credit union those services in interest rates or whatever you pay the credit union they profit that has created\nIs returned to their members in the form of increased services or in the form of actual dispersed much\nI mean sometimes you actually get a little check from your credit you put into your account and so uh that's the difference uh banks don't don't offer banks don't like credit union as they say they have an unfair advantage\nBecause there have nonprofit status I'm more or less really not true\nUm the it's real simple the credit union simply does not make a profit because whatever profit has made this fall back into cheaper checking accounts better interest rates on loans or higher interest rates on savings\nAnd so the you know basically they end up not making a profit so if a bank wanted to uh make less profit could do the same thing\nSo they don't have a disadvantage they're just trying to keep stock holders happy and sell stuff to customers the credit union has customers that are the stockholders in a sense the owners are the members and so it returns and all of that really doesn't matter ... bit\nIf you don't get good service from the organization\nAnd so we endorsed credit unions are not because of their nonprofit status but because they have reasonably priced goods and ... are reasonably priced banking services for you to use hand you'll be treated not like a number\nYou we treated ... by you know people that actually care you'll also have that similar experience at a local community by a regional banks and that's who I Do business with personally\nI don't personally have an account right now a credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts and our our personal accounts are all have local uh ... are ...\nAnd all and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone to talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charge you for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings or their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated or not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city's endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nThat he may not become one of our best justices ever based on this

doing this so how long did the hundred and fifty two thousand plus or a hundred ...\nIt took a seven point eight years love it [laughter] and your range of income during that time we started out Dave at a hundred and eight thousand dollars a year and now we're north of two hundred thousand which is awesome yeah yeah or the kids are all gone\nYet we have one at home that we never see her or he just started her freshman year at nursing\nJust thinking as your income went up you've got rid of all the payroll yes we're saying we love it love it and got rid of the dead on top of that so what kind of that was the one hundred and fifty two thousand\nA stupid that all of it um our smallest at with a fleet that we finance tough flew to the flu season and stuff are looked at that time we were down ... and then our our largest stat with our student loan and then of course our house okay\nAll right so I'm thinking James is gonna bump out with like Jeff Roe toll maybe I'm thinking I don't know\nWhat can I Do hear did you say you're paid off your house or how your have you played out here I'm looking at where the ball that made us you know that at some point eight years that's about the normal time you did the whole thing top to bottom Wheldon aunt lived life while you're doing it with college and cars and the whole bit yeah [laughter] wow\nVery fine so tell me the story what got you started on doing this seven point eight years ago\nCeltic this one [laughter] so I was at work Dave and I was talking to a good friend of mine named Josh and he was telling us about his ... story and I started reading I started listening to you and I came home one day and I was just\nMad well and he really wasn't mad he was passed I don't know if\nI could step past my I got out I was just [laughter] so I said\nThey we've worked so hard I'm and\nGod's blessed us so much and here we sit and we got nothing to show for it yeah um and you know it\nYou know it just really tore us up and so that day we went out we bought a home study kit\nAnd we forced um all four of our kids to go through the Thirteen week only study kit with us while I'm and we did it and what's awesome days is all four of our kids now live on a budget they're all just kill it and they're doing what we should've done when we were Eighteen and twenty\nSay wow they like to say we were torturing them I'm sure\nYeah like Iran she's a cuss word Thirteen weeks ... it was even longer torture sessions you should have been at the Ramsey house when we made our kids go\n[laughter] that was nasty\nIt was ugly wow well why do you guys so it took so what was the biggest thing you learned that you tell people this is how we got out of that we did this this and this\nAnd I love to use them hope\nThat I like to use the across stick for hope\nUm I think first being honest with yourself I'm saying you screwed up\nYou did this you got to get out of it right now I'm looking for options and opportunity if you don't use it sell it and if you're not working go to work\nAnd pay for a plan to do the budget due this year ... budget do the baby steps and do it in order don't don't become a genius on your own ... and then he um you got to execute it doesn't matter if you make that plan if you're not executing it and no excuses dang dang\nThat one where that'll that'll breach right there where to go back and I have I'm preaching and a couple of weeks after an automatic on the on off yeah I Would I'd watch you dreamed it up to him [laughter] well done you guys\nVery well done that's good that's good you're going to add to that James or is that just to intimidating\nTo follow a yeah I mean what are you got to say after that it's all about [laughter] very good\nTool cool what was the hardest part\nSo the hardest part for me Dave was telling her kids know um you know our kids were in the age range that tend to sixteen\nAnd we were doing everything they I mean we had a good income I mean our kids were taken lessons for sports we had him doing clarinet lessons and flew lessons and fish and I sat down with our kids right after right when we bought a home study kids and we told them what we said guys your mom and dad are screwed up\nHe pulled back off of those ... those watch that's going away you'll you'll save on the power you make while you're on it you know but but you don't put anything in the bank so I mean\nThat would return on investment spill virtually nonexistent when that happens when he\nGoes out half as not enough\nIt becomes a lot less than half and right now it's about a ten year rate of return\nOh that's too long anyway so into something with ...\nIf I don't add to it I should have practice that there's a lot of start up stuff that's in that first ten thousand [noise] and then it cost the cost to go forward from there\nI Would like to do with it and have a five year break even\n[noise] so it doesn't have a five year break even don't even mess with\nI wouldn't do it because here's the problem technology changes so fast\nAnd the marketplaces changing so fast I mean solar panels five years ago versus several panels now solar panels ten years ago versus now\nOn the complete their light years different oh yeah and and what they do and what they cost for that matter and so I'm number one let's pretend you were sitting debt free and had like a pile of cash in the bank um I personally wouldn't vote for the ... even then\nIf it was just extra money laying around and they are only a five year break even I wouldn't I don't think it economically makes sense but aside from that discussion you just don't have the money\nA shirt you're in debt and or if you can get there by the end the year you can be dead free have your emergency phone in place and then by these things by your starter system if you want to get in and you can do a five year break even that way\nBut I don't think you can hit all of that with what you're telling me that is a lot yeah and so I just I I Can't tell you I I mean I I'm a fan of solar panels in general\nBut I'm a fan but the only way obviously I Would tell you it's by pay cash for it and I wouldn't take it out of your emergency fun to do it so doing it instead of an emergency fund is the same thing\nSure and so I I you know I Would be inconsistent and I got you know the answer questions or what would I Do know what I Know I Can't tell you but here's the thing Jeff I have laid these principles in place in my life personally like I don't borrow money like we don't use the emergency phone except for emergencies\nNo matter what ever period and\nIt has caused me to walk away from some things\nLike that I really did want to do like you really want to do this and you're going to walk away from it at least for now unless something changes in after our conversation right [noise]\nBut um you know if you do what I tell you the you're going to walk away from his caused me to do that and I kind of went off yeah gosh lord what are you doing here come on God show up you know you don't mean don't you like solar panels go I mean\nYou know seriously and um I walked away from some stuff and then thirty six months later\nFour years later I look back and I go oh that's why I wasn't supposed to do that\nYou know that that that that we're view mirror hindsight is twenty twenty\nI mean you can tell what was going on when you look back but you don't know going forward but I Do know that when I violate the principles I always lived to regret it using the emergency fund for something other than emergencies\nAnd I've not done that because ... and I got burned so bad when we went broke the scars were so deep the lesson was so thorough\nThat we don't borrow money for anything ever and\nWe don't even use the emergency fund for emergencies I mean much less anything else because that fund is like it's like sacred to her because of the scar that is in our lives from having gone broke she just it's been Thirty years and she still can remember the taste in her mouth that that terror\nBrought that level of fear brought and so we really we don't even use the emergency run for emergencies I mean it's you know we've got a big pile of cash and for no apparent reason\nOther than it's S. W. I. sharing once it you know and and you know even then something comes up we just we ... we cash flow it or we wait a little bit because we don't even do use emergency funds for emergencies so that's that's\nServed us so well oversaw long period of time Jeff I think I Would be doing you a disservice to tell you to do something I wouldn't do even though I get while you're doing this and I intellectually grasp your argument or your your your um\nYour conflict in this discussion so I'm not against solar panels I Want them to break even quake and what you pay cash for a\nMatter of fact I'm a fan of solar panels and I've been divorced them in several cities but that's the case thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Bridget as one of those in Dallas Hi Bridget how're you\nDave hey what's up I'm I program in last night I cook the dead baby steps one and it's hard it are they step too good and then I came across a medical bills that were like Taco Bell he paid off and\nIt dawned on me that we now have a healthy to count and I've only been listening to the show try a few weeks and I haven't really heard much about how the ... ... I was just curious\nIf I can pay the bills that have faded account shut eye or should I say that as like\nOh my ... my emergency fund and we do have three small children and I didn't know they get sick they break fame ...\nLike the ... yeah yeah yeah we wish we spent some time were staples in the emergency room with our kids as part of growing up but um I think it is it wasn't ... [laughter] but uh so uh yeah\nWould use your ... your age has said to pay medical bills with and there's two reasons\nIf you take a thousand dollars home and pay taxes on it it turns into seven hundred dollars and then you pay medical bills with that if you put it into your age I say the whole one thousand can go towards your medical bills so it's as if the government pay three hundred out of every thousand for you\nBy ... by running any medical expenses through the ... say and um and you can always go back later add more to it when you get further along and you get out of debt build up my emergency fund baby steps plan but for right now I think you're on this\nSomething I Will how much is in the ... say\nI'm right now there's only a hundred and fifty hours and how much in medical bills do you have [noise] um okay well\nOkay so it's not going to wipe it out or anything you're still yeah I you know that's six hundred bucks is a tax free methodology to pay your bills or medical bills and any other money you can dump into that each essay through payroll doc loaded up and run it back out to pay that other ten thousand because you're saving thirty cents on the dollar\nUm okay so I was under the impression that I couldn't you are a check for bills that we acquired when we have to check it\nOut now that may be true yeah okay yeah so it would have to be something that came up after that but now you can you can ... you need to double check that out I think you're right but I'm not I'm not an expert on that part I could give you a wrong answer and you need a better\nAnswer that in mind because I could screw this up but I think you're right though but I Would double check it 'cause there's some money on the line you know but anything any medical bill you can run through that age as he's going to save you roughly thirty cents on the dollar and so\nAnything that does qualify I Would do that no question about it a good question I give her joining us what Bridget having used a new listener and not about what's this particular our and above ... thanks to change jobs like dumpsters our senior executive producer to kill Daniels Russia producer and phones Springer I'm Dave Ramsey your host\nAnd\n\nAnd [noise]\nYou guys hear me say all the time that if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else I'm so excited to introduce our brand new book every day millionaires how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth and how you can to\nWritten by number one national best selling author Kris Hogan his book is based on the largest study ever done what ten\nThousand millionaires and the results will shock you you will learn the real truth about what it takes to become a millionaire\nIt doesn't matter where you came from it matters where you're going today you can pre order everyday millionaires for only twenty dollars and get over fifty dollars in free bonus items the bonus items include the everyday millionaires audio book any book a video lesson for me called it's okay to be wealthy\nAnd the video lesson from Chris Hogan called how to retire inspired pre order every day millionaires Dave Ramsey dot com or call us at AAA twenty two piece\nK.

radio station this week\nSo good a good folks won't be all for coming by you're here to do your debt free scream how much you mean by it off forty nine thousand dollars very cool and how long did that take twenty six months for you and your range of income during that time oh between eighty five eighty seven thousand\n... will do for a living I'm a pastor and I'm a dental hygienist All right very good what kind of debt was this forty thousand\nIt was a credit card debt hospital bills a student loans\nOkay go how long have you been married uh twenty seven years will be on friday alright regulations make very much so what happened after twenty seven years well after twenty five years twenty six months ago the started this\nUm [noise] well it really does go back a long time um for the first twenty something years of our marriage we really didn't have what you call do an income problem mhm I was always trying to cut budget he was always trying to increase the income ... um and so that led to a lot of credit card debt\nAnd then we decided to increase our income by going back to school but unfortunately we did that um with student loans and then we had credit card debt in student loans\nAnd then in two thousand fourteen we finally got tired of the credit card debt and cut up the cards and that afternoon way telling broke his ankle\nSo that required surgery as soon as he got off the catch is our son fell and broke both of his arms wow and that required surgery had credit card that school loans and ... of course yeah and so I'm In two thousand Fifteen\nI sat down to do our income taxes that January and I looked at our income and realized we had made the most money we never made 'em but we also had the most that we never had ... and and this was sick and tired yeah\nWas emotional moment when\nIt was basically a she said to me we're going to financial piece university and I said yes ma'am\n[laughter] yeah 'cause uh this lady doesn't get choked up very often but it twenty five years when she does you pay attention as right yeah I hear you very cool\nSharon Ramsey is not a crier either a and if she does some serious was going on so you stop and take note very cool boil congratulations so obviously normally you been doing the budget all these years or trying to\nAnd when you drug into financial piece university the free spirit pasture here uh did you uh what what happened then with the two of you on your interaction\nAbout money the change that process it has it's improved\nOh yeah I did it from the first night of initiatives university I cried through about half of it you know the Holy Spirit conviction along with you know the message that was coming through just them\nIt changed and and you know it really\nIt takes a change in mindset is what does that change my mind set you know the Bible says that were transformed by the renewing over mine and I had to have my mind renewed\nThe funny thing is I was working at FedEx part time delivering packages and I would listen to your show mhm I wasn't doing a thing you said there's nothing to offer you every day you know so the fees are being planted but now when that time came I just knew it was time\nYeah the entertainment squid and the actual listening began as\nFun very cool you know that's what what I signed the ... uh the total money make over book with a script for I use Roman swelled to to be transformed by the renewing of your mind or don't be conform to this world are crazy out there and\nDon't be don't be like everybody else are nuts and uh uh my pastor always so don't let the world teacher theology you know a so good stuff you guys so what do you tell people when they find out you got forty nine thousand dollars worth of debt paid off what do you don't like the keys to getting out of\nAre but like I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh I always wanted to drive a newer car I never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset you're always going to have a car payment and so you know your pace\nRegard for five or six years and they would against even as we get another payment and uh so we have not had a car payment for four years we were driving to very old cars one is sixteen years old the other one's eleven years old while but we drove it up here from South Carolina this morning and it made it finds out and made it finally gets us where we need to go and never again never again\nA very random on average it'll make about one point two to one point seven percent right of return horrible about like you're stupid savings account right\nAnd I'm In of course it's very front loaded the first three or four years all of the extra that you're paying instead of going to savings goes to fees and so you get no cash value build up for the first one to three years\nSomething like that and um and then of course when you die the only thing they pay even though you paid extra create the savings account but the only thing they pay is the face value and show the money you paid in a savings account you'd lose so you have a savings account that has a bad right of return and when you die they keep your money that's just not a good plan\nUm the uh the universal life is the newer version of that um or the next newest version whole life's the oldest\nOf the cash value plans the universal life was in an attempt to make it a little bit better and\nIt pays a I'm a better rate of return typically I'm most universal life will average net of fees around a four and a half to five percent right of return us what's more like an annuity ah and I was an insurance company more like a fixed annuity top of a product\nAnd then the the biggest downfall with universal not only that keep your money when you die but the other downfall is is the you pay one set amount per month\nAnd the insurance cost the amount that goes to insurance versus the amount that goes to saving the amount that's going to the insurance goes up every year as you get older\nSo that by the time you get really old with universal the amount you're paying may not even cover the insurance\nYou have zero going into savings and sometimes some of the money is coming out of the cash value to actually support the policy 'cause you're not paying enough to pay their insurance premiums because insurance costs ... universal goes up every year a but even with that it's slightly better than\nWhole life uh but both you know it's just one socks and one such worse you know that's all it is and then the next one up the next version that came out was called variable life\nAnd if you ever hear of that that's another version and basically what they did there is in the savings portion that put mutual funds in there and you can choose the mutual funds inside your very alive policy and you get a much better right of return\nNet of fees you'll make about seven percent usually on that\nBut the problem is a mutual funds were paying twelve to Fifteen and you're making seven which tells you what the fees are they charge a lot of fees on these things\nAnd so I'm sure there's just a fee everywhere every corner you call around where you're dealing with an insurance company\nSo the bottom line is with life insurance anytime you're saving money with life insurance companies you're going to get feed the death you're going to get a substandard right of return and an almost every case they're going to keep your money when you die\nAnd so that all makes it just a horrible place to\nPay money into a savings account that when you keep your mouth that they keep your money when you die and so that's why we recommend and always have recommended than I personally have always bought once I got my head screwed on and understood how the math work um I actually bought whole life one time from a rip off company called northwestern mutual but I was in my twenties and I was stupid\nUm do a lot of stupid stuff in my life so that's one of the stupid things so yeah unbelievable\nBut ah and they're like the most expensive one of the worst ones out there you know so horrible horrible products so we buy term life insurance which costs about five dollars a month instead of a hundred dollars a month or two one twentieth\nFor the same amount of insurance and I put my other Ninety five dollars anywhere else for investing I put it in a fruit jar and I come off better off than those guys and so I put it any anywhere else and\nAnd so what you end up with is eighty percent of the people that sell life insurance for a living and that's all they sell or out of the business in one year\nYou have an eighty percent turn over in the whole life life insurance world and here's here's why the business model is basically this the general agency hire someone in order to get to their friends and family\nAnd the new new insurance salesmen as used to get to friends and family\nAnd then once you've worked through their market what's called their natural market uh then their ability to sell insurance to strangers is all is just horrible it's it's never happens and so they very seldom make it once they run out of their list\nAnd so they milk the their list they milk their relationships and then they turn over that's why there's such a high turnover rate and that's generally the business model now I Know guys that are northwestern mutual agents or Pacific Life agents or New York life agents that have been in the business for twenty five or Thirty years but they're the ones actually learned how to sell insurance\nAnd they don't and some of them are generally agents and they you know they hire people to work their list is what it amounts to knowing that they're probably not going to make it after they run through their list\nBut that's kind of how that business works and it's kind of an old model honestly it's pretty much dying or the old whole life life insurance is kind of a Nineteen fifties sixties even seventies thing but by the eighties nineties and certainly up out of the two thousands\nI mean no one tells you to buy cash value insurance anymore anywhere that is a credible financial mind except people to sell it\nThe only people that recommended or those salad\nYou just can't find anybody that's an independent third party like me I don't sell either one I don't care what you buy I endorse sander for term insurance was cause I Believe in term insurance and no I don't own Zander insurance Jeb lander owns ... insurance she's an advertiser\nBut a whole life couldn't buy an ad on this show for any amount of money we wouldn't sell it to him because it's not good product\nJust like a payday lender couldn't buy ad on the show when my me endorsing at our car leasing company couldn't buy an ad on the show because they're rip off products credit card and you know we're not gonna have a day Ramsey credit card coming out I can just assure you that and they all kind of fall in that same category it's a rip off it's a bad product\nAnd the ... and you know the reason is a bad product is not a moral judgment it's math judgment\nThe math is bad you know when you borrow money at eight hundred percent interest on a payday loan the math is bad when you borrow when you save money in a whole life policy die and they keep your money your savings accounts that dumb the math", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show",
