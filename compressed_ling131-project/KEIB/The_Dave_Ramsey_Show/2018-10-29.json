brother out of the house\nAnd on your debt for uh yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on dude it's not my goal I'd sell that rental property up as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand dollars upside down so well let's wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it a ... a year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to write a large check to get rid of it I'd rather out a hundred and thirty six dollar check than a what a forty dollars march ex I'll do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling that a tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out to do that it's just where you ended up by marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it in in the meantime

Georgia hearing the lobby of Ramsey solutions Hi Dale how're you\nDoing great thanks Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nI well I had an unusual question and I've been pondering it for a while\nI'm after my divorce I moved to a guest and started working and I moved in with friends in their garage apartment mhm so I have use of kitchen restroom and laundry on normally think she would renting a room ... um [noise]\nBut I came across a condo that are wandering the realtors old and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five to Seventy mhm and it ... and was rented [laughter] when I bought it for a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month\nAnd my rent where I Am is only five hundred\nAnd this one's going to be available for the end of the year and I've been wondering do I want to move into it make it my own home now that it's making mhm she bought it and it's rented right okay and what's your income oh average about thirty five thousand a year commissions\nMhm okay well I ... the way I answer question is what always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um\nWhat feels good and the short term might not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd our show when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which of these decisions takes me there okay now obviously you can live in a garage apartment how old are you\nI'm not fifty five okay then you could live in a garage apartment or your sixty five and you could make the trends are actual spread here I'm making next door some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you the question you ask yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can to increase my income during the next ten years and be living in a condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right but that really wasn't a it's kind of camping ... when you're not a college student [laughter] I mean it's just camping that's right you know and so this isn't like your destiny if not worse\nYou want to be long term budget and so my point is just because of the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you killed and you've settled you got your found footing under you again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a condo I'm probably moving into that condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now it makes me Seventy thousand instead of thirty five and what track 'em on there what am I gotta do to get my support a healing is believing in yourself again at a way ... our our believe in yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut ... if that's where you are that's where your head as I think I'm going to move into the condo now if you're headed is saying you know I think I'm probably going to the solemn ever going to do I'm just going to route thirty five thousand into retirement you might want to round garage department or the other money in your pocket\nBut I don't think that you I'm not really like to purchase a house and you keep the ... rental income now well let's get it paid off is paid off oh good that'd be awesome them you will by if you get an extra money to about beyond Tobias worth\nSaving not at the moment not okay then living in a condo with no payment at all you know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that goal faster\nSo um I I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh I'm back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back\nYeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to house them or pay cash for 'cause my incomes going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm a I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now\nYour back is that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Claire how are you\nHow they how are you know how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so with all your data sets for a little left in the air now and I feel like we are on I had already Harmon but we're behind on college savings fact you can show how old are your kids you\nIf it was paid for in order to have three hundred and savings okay and the answer real quickly in my mind will be no right right and because all we're doing is doing that in reverse aren't way yesterday and so that's how I kind of get there but the thing the reason I was asking some of the questions I'm trying to think you know two hundred thousand is not a huge mistake it's a good one\nBut it's not a huge one I mean it's going to produce Fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year in income\nAnd um then they've got the other uh Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a year coming in from Social Security give or take ... and they gotta live on that otherwise they burn through this nest egg and they ended up having to sell the farm in their old age right and I don't want to do that so as long as they'll keep\nA spending less than the income that is produced by the two hundred\nAnd their Social Security stay on a ... household budget that's below that then the game plan you and I just talked about will run in perpetuation no matter how long they live okay is that it's not logical to you sir as long as they do that then yes I Would do it in a heartbeat\nA cause I Love the idea of going into your you know your latter years will everything paid for especially your home box when your home is paid for and you're sixty\nSeven you stabilized for the next Thirty years to your Ninety seven your ... your your housing costs and your housing costs as the largest cost in your budget\nTo if you're renting your rent goes up every year for the next Thirty years if you're sixty seven and and that sounds like homelessness to me later unless you've got a huge mistake\nAnd so by owning and by owning with no debt you've completely stabilized your golden years Tyler is with us in Oklahoma City Hi Tyler how are you\nA day if I appreciate you taking my call sure man what's up\n[noise] well my uh wife and I did our debt prescribing last year in July so we're on scraps four or five and six awesome when I got back to the Oklahoma City area scream\nA couple of months later started to change my job an employer after a ah what appeared to be a better job of it for us and our family at the time\nAnd it produced nothing but a year worth of turmoil and so now I just lost my job on friday last week [laughter] I'm working through the debt snowball paying off my student loans [laughter]\nI think I pretty much a burden myself out of my career path and so\nI'm a pharmacist and light training is is skilled in such that I'm new at this point I don't see myself as as marketable for other areas and so that's where I'm trying to figure out a been reading books like crazy this last year [noise]\nBecause I'm passionate about um group small business I have an entrepreneurial heart and I still like working with people that work in the health care sector has just\nEating my lunch this past year and so I'm trying to figure out what to do\nNow I should not actually doing pharmacy or dealing with the customers a chew up it's the bureaucracy and show how is there another way we apply your existing education skills to the market that rather than just work in a CBS\nMhm correct um\nI don't know but I I Would think that there's got to be some kind of ... a ... idea out there kind of old school ... high\nEnd delivery or something that is not all insurance based in driving me crazy\nRight you know like if they're using the doctors got some of the doctors box go to the country or model right correct where they lower the number of patients that they see and you pay a flat fee and you've got like they'll do house calls and everything and they actually know their patience now\nRight that kind of thing where they lower that did different gotta practice management is the I Wonder if there's that kind of application to your world I have no idea I'm making this up right now charm flu pharmacist\nJob market is saturated um they they've been dumping pharmacist more and more pharmacists and ever since I graduated\nWhen I say the U.S and Walgreens is just they're just stamping out that's the ... world show right and that's\nThe world I came from a smaller smaller sector\nAnd you know here I Am I lost a hundred and forty five thousand dollar income and I'm thinking well you know what next door [laughter] I'll be ... I Can't pull the Lee I'm so to the doctor because the doctor longer right\nWell I mean there's ... there's two things one is I'm trying to think through if I'm you a business model because you've got an entrepreneurial\nItch to scratch that is some kind of ... low insurance no insurance a profit Gary model where you use your licensing and your knowledge is you're very specialized in very valuable knowledge\nRight and that's not what's your burned out on your burn out on the corporate crap right\nAnd uh and so is there another way to be a pharmacist in today's world that you invent even if it's on a small scale I don't care I'm right I'm going to begin to investigate business model ideas like that around the country and see who's doing\nLike an old school of pop the Kerry I'm almost thinking like a soda fountain and the thing like the old days you know kind of thing we're stuff but I don't know I I'm just making this up in my head sitting here I Know that ... here's the thing I Do know about the marketplace the very very high end high service\nA luxury markets are booming in every sector\nThe uh low end the bottom end which is all price base is booming middle grade product lines of services are not booming in any\nSpace those are people I mean in other words\nSheep hotels enriches or doing good the ones in the middle are struggling\nRight and so get off on one end of those spaces you figure it out the bottom and other commodities how spacious killing you so we're probably going to some kind of high end thing is they're the ... to rich people model some way I don't know I'm making this up\nI'm just asking questions out loud now while we're discovering that I might go back in ... for another year or two of the grinder\nTo put away two hundred thousand bucks to go live my dream with\nOkay but I'm not going to submit myself to Thirty years of this grind right okay but I put up with all kinds of crap for a little while to get to where I Want to go\nThis last year has been so brutal and my wife and family that you know they they now see what I saw um you know a year and a half ago it's\nBrutal on their wife and family just your time you're\n... my my morale\nOkay but your morale has everything to do with what you're looking towards you thought you were stuck there I can I don't want my Morales bat if I'm standing and poked my knees okay but not bad if I'm standing put money is because I'm walking through that shoveling it to use it as fertilizer to grow a crop\nFor okay you see the difference if I can look past it I can walk to anything but you could look past it in the last year and it destroyed your emotion germ your gas tanks empty\nRight I'm kinda glad that I said that chapter you know and I turned on the page yeah\nMy point is you could walk back into a similar situation if you knew your only doing it for two years because at the end of two years we're going to do X Y and Z\nRight okay but you gotta have your X Y and Z defined and I'm I'm not capable of doing that in this setting\nIn you know a minute and forty five seconds on the radio but I mean at least get you started there so you got the right stuff do you just got to believe in

Detroit keeping it or we\nDon't understand how his brain works\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI thought you said the two of you were working on a plan to get out of that\nI that we were a kid yeah\nI'm more concerned about the fact that he's not on this plan than I Am the ring\nI agree because what my next week he's going to finance power tools\nMhm yeah and then he's going to come on when the new ... about three weeks from now\nWhat have I think a lot more there you go there you go what's finance that six thousand dollar drawn their lawn mower you might be a redneck give you a payments on you're riding mower you know I mean Syria ... did you see the breakdown breakdown is we can't get out of a whole hour digging out the bottom\nCats I told them so I'm a lot more concerned about his lack of grass that this was the family goal that I Am whether or not you keep this ring ... personally I take it back I mean I've been married thirty five years and\nYou know it'd be nice to have an ice rink and you can get another ring I mean there's just stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you couldn't afford\nJak lay and hate sweet but dumb well you know right yeah I think\nSo but I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and ... back and a little bit better you know in order to you all the ... are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that ten percent on one of the keep the ring or not\n[laughter] yeah we have to say the least yeah how old is he\nA he'll be twenty eight [laughter]\nOkay um is\nWhat is one of the nature what's the nature of his disability\n[noise] um [noise] a losing land okay I'm In a a in a concrete labor accident\nGotcha okay leg or arm what leg okay All right\nAnd I'm not to minimize that 'cause that's a horrible thing but that's all\n[laughter] yeah and you know I think basically what's been happening is there's been many different disputes back and forth in counter suing going on by lawyers\nAnd that's all that's all behind us you think now you think this has come and go ahead\nI think it's I'm finally getting to the point to where there's going to be actual real settlement um talk and um there's just been some shady things going on in the court cases\nWells what twenty million dollars there's they're gonna they're gonna mess with it you can count on that [noise] yeah okay\nWow\nAll right so uh and what is his emotional and mental state\nI think honestly he just wants to be working he wants to be back at work he doesn't\nWant to get what a prosthetic leg and he'll be able to do something with his mind now they won't be doing heavy lifting things or something like that probably right\nExactly that's that's the hope except for he's got a desire to do those kinds of things so it's really killing him to just sit around\n... around but I mean I'm you know you usually actually make more money with your mind that you do with your body anyway\nRight as a career path so generally speaking it so that's forced upon him here which is I'm not not a bad thing is what I'm thinking so I I think he he gets to sit down and ask themselves that question what do I want to do if I could do anything in the world because now he can do anything in the world\n[noise] right right\nAnd so I'm going to coach him on finding a career that he loves and I'm going to spend a very small percentage of this money goes or take as much of that ... percent you that much money to do some kind of retooling as far as education goes\nAnd saying okay I'm going to get a degree in X or y or I'm going to get some training in X or y and I'm going to learn to be one of those things over there or whatever those things are that he wants to do so what's he want to be when he's fifty five years old that he's made his life's work and his career and he\nGets to choose that now that's awesome can be a self employed track it could be a A R a track of uh some kind of a a a I don't know I mean anything but it's obviously not going to be something that is physically um demanding\nOkay right that's okay that's okay in terms
