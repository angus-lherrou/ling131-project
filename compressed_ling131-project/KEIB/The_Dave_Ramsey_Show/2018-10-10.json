even catch up for about two months behind on all bills is causing a lot of stress on our marriage or kids were tired of living this way but we feel like we're in so much debt in so deep that we can't get out\nYou know just seeing it gets really really scary when you're in a situation like that and I'm part of what's scary is the sense that you're stuck part of what's scary is you're overwhelmed\nAnd um\n[noise] let's stop and pull one segment out of this thing and talk about that for a second or two months behind on our bills and it's causing us so much stress on our marriage and the kids being behind on your bill should not affect your kids\nThey should know about it you don't need to tell your five year old or behind on the lights that smoke there\nA more mature problem and you can tell the kids know but you don't have to give him a big long reason why knows a complete sentence [noise] no but don't pass off the uh you know don't pass off the stress of the kids\nNow let's look at the rest of this what do you do when you're completely overwhelmed and terrified and feel stuck I've been there somebody I don't know what I'm Talking about you've been there to do\nIt is no fun OK here's how you fix\nYou have to begin to take control of what you can take control of you have an income let's make sure that that first is being controlled and that's called the budget\nNow you do not have to be able to pay everything to do a budget all a budget is as you're telling the money that you do have where it is going to go\nAnd so when you can't pay everything which catching everything up and one month would be paying everything right\nWhen you can't pay everything then you've got to say well the money that we have we're going to do the most we can do with that and for this month that's all we can do\nSo you prioritize you make enough to buy food you did not make enough to eat out so we're not going to restaurants but we are going to the grocery store and we're going to feed our family and we're going to cook from scratch 'cause it's healthier and it costs less\nSo there we go do\nYou make enough to do that check what that one down for the food budget downright that number down and you can do that you make enough to pay your lights and water and if you're behind on them you catch them all up this month\nBefore you do anything else after you ate get current on your lights get current on your water now if you have a six hundred dollar a month cable bill because you have NFL super duper pooper scooper or whatever then cancel all that\nCrap but I'm Talking about water and the lights and gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lots of water on and gas to heat if it's gas heat okay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them right now\nNumber three shelter\nNow you pay your rent\nIt doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there is no heat so you gotta put heat in the place okay so you pay your rent if you're behind on your rent before you move on to number for you catch up on your rent\nNumber for transportation\nYour current on the car and you keep gash in the car now if that takes all your money and you can pay nothing else this month oh well\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car and your credit card and cut up your stupid credit card [laughter] okay okay now your debt free right okay yeah okay and that was foreign to\nGet so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right yeah okay and your land is paid off and it's worth sixty about fifty\nAbout fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay uh well we're going to put fourteen thousand in the emergency fund\nComplicate it so now you have an emergency phone you put ten thousand with the land you get a construction loan with a take out one one apartment to take out\nIn your budget cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on the couch okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nDoes that make sense phone so that means you're building a two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum okay\nBecause the packages worth three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house now you're at three sixty and you don't have twenty percent down anymore\nHuh OK you see how that works\nSo you're getting on the corruption alone that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage pitch called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction loan and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you can just package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they can probably help you with that and you're going to lock in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause he's a mortgage editor writer ticking up and a good idea to lock 'em in when you can by the way if you have a ... and you got a higher interest rate loans folks this would be the time to call Joe Joe mortgage a it is taking up\nAnd I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights and\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago with legitimate period but we are in a rising interest rate environment\nNothing to panic about but it is going up and so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible right you can get your hands on for refinanced were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's by locking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see rates come back down dramatically um you know in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve much they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends um then then I'm going to walk everything as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage today and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey Dave ... are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from a and gotten a baby step too good and um yeah I don't want to live that momentum that we had to\nReally toward this debt mhm I'm going to a baby step three there's like a few curve balls I guess\nAh that are happening so we want to August ... babysat three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school to get a bachelor's they get a better paying job that would be our baby step three\nOkay but that's my question is you know we also want to start a family but we need some type of like a defined because we want to cash flow that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you will build up a baby fun no need to do it with him\nOkay so build up the emergency fund for\nMerchants who fired first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby\nUm if you got I got health insurance you know and you should have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency fund in place and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me your work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah the labor and delivery\nNo that's easy enough to do during that's easy enough to do during an on much\nOkay\nYeah so you could just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way you can just say well we're now we're saving for that and and then you know anything you want to do that's an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency phone 'cause it's not an emergency him going back to school is not emergency this Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency you can cover it\nIt's a luxury to have that as extra savings or maybe came on the way writes baby got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know that better than they are not curve balls are things that happened after baby step three Oh thanks for the call appreciate it\nJoining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five cliff is with us in Chapel Hill North Carolina Hi cliff our you\nKnow I Can't complain how are you making out\nBetter than I deserve how can I help well first off I Want to thank you for what you help me and my wife to help pay off five thousand dollars worth of debt cool\nYes sir Yes sir and my question to you is a way to find out and fight\nRight now we have about thirty thousand dollar down and own

can we afford with our income ... and the contract that we've been talking the recommended to us alone and you're not a fan of\nAbsolutely not no I Would never do your do you\nKnow it's a it's a subsidized loan and if you ever sell the house or go to refinance alone at any point you're going to pay back all the subsidy and in some\nYou get really trapped in these things and they're nasty bad no I never went to a U.S the law I have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWow so wow now stay worthwhile as far as how much how you can afford and we always say I'm you know put your down payment or whatever that is the end of the formula right and then the loan amount on a Fifteen year\nFixed rate loan which today's about five percent interest\nLoan amount on a Fifteen year fixed rate loan\nIs\nNo more the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay and and that put you right where you want to be shown what you've done some really good stuff\nOpen now I mean you can really do it I mean you you've you've gotten out of debt you build your emergency fund you're doing really smart things so yeah I just get

currently have a mortgage\nThirty award I'm about three hundred and fifty thousand [laughter]\nAnd I am wondering if I should use money after ... ... in savings account um sex acts of my emergency account to pay their saw or Chuck ... jokes on it at a at a time I have I have the money that we're having trouble\nOr do you have it up with what are you having trouble with the whole you know about your money just you know what you know what what I can make you know they weren't sure how what's your house actually we're probably about six hundred thousand or\nBased on your concern about turns out of your money ... six hundred thousand on it\nA chunk Dexter on it why\nThat started out as a um contrary to your ... your money problem\nYou're yup\nShouldn't consistent okay so here's what's going on\nRight you you have um some good information but it's incomplete\n'em and show that in the cause you'll be left with a a a primitive analysis and let me walk you through that right [noise] 'cause I used to think exactly the same way so I Know where your brain is okay so because you obviously have a good intellect on especially with the natural things so\nYour your concern is if I can borrow money at three four or five percent and I can reinvest isn't good mutual fund at ten ten eleven twelve percent and might not making that spread why would I ever\nYou know miss out on that spread and um you know I've got the money invested now it's making me ten twelve whatever it's making me not the day but it's making me that overall and why would I lose that spread and uh I had to really wrestle that down because that's how I was trained in the financial world obviously with a finance degree\nAnd then I had to start looking at didn't want to start looking at stuff through the lens of the bar or a slave to the lender and there's no good mentions of debt and scripture and I'm going okay either God's stupid or and I've got something figured out he doesn't know about or there's something I don't understand\nAnd so um what I figured out was was that that formula that we just years\nTen percent over four percent ... percent spread leaves out risk\nAnd in a sophisticated uh investment analysis you adjust for risk\nMeaning I Would never compare a growth in income mutual fund apples to apples with an aggressive growth stocks mutual fund\nThe rest of gross stock mutual fund might have an average annual return of twenty twenty percent the other one might have an average and overturn of twelve percent but the risk ratio is completely different risk profile and those two fun just completely different agreed\nAgreed okay so what you would do is you would adjust and in in\nWorld you can actually use a thing called a beta with an inverse formula and we'll get an all that crap but basically you can say because one is more risky than the other we mathematically adjusted for risk to be able to compare them apples to apples\nAnd that's the proper way to do an analysis between those two funds but no one applies that concept that that level of sophistication to this debt analysis that says Tom by your money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house\nI I don't know which risk neutralizes a lot of that was the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you're you know when you factor interest 'cause we're there is risk when your mortgage now it's not a lot of risk 'cause you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off by or an investment to pay it off but there is rich\nIn show or you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures occur on home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that\nWell how I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career\nYou start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there was a before and those things are really hard to put on paper so\nThe pawn shop the title poem the rent to own the number one ZIP Code that

possible reasons someone's in poverty you're born into it\nYou are oppressed by others\nOr\nYour choices are stupid these are the three things that caused me to be poor cause you to be poor\nAnd the only one of those three variables you can control as you your choices you can't control what other people do you can't control what you were born into\n... spoke to us a while back in leadership event we had around her leadership summit and she was talking about growing up in a segregated a working class to poor neighborhood and she said her parents kept telling her her whole time growing up and she's freaking secretary of state okay so brilliant\nHighly educated woman\nFabulous communicator\nI think we can all say she kind of made it okay\nBut she came out of that neighborhood she wasn't born into and obviously she was a woman obviously she's African American so a couple of strikes right there right it was she said mom and dad told me they didn't tell me about the victim they taught me it doesn't matter where you're from it matters where you're going\nOh no matter where you're from matters where you're going and so I don't know where you started most of us didn't start with a silver spoon\nOr your privilege okay I'll take your privilege whatever you probably just I don't know what your privileges but you know I've never known anybody that had privileged made their life perfectly easy and with no obstacles\nThere ain't that much privilege out there yeah some people start further ahead than others I get that but I Can't control that I can only control my response you can only control your response and it's your decision it doesn't matter where you are coming from what matters is where you are going love that quote\n\nHard work brings profit talk leads to poverty
