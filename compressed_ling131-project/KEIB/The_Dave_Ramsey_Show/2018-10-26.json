in this price range a you know it wouldn't if you worry wouldn't make any sense I'm ... and so this move down to half of the house has probably three to five year plan correct\nOkay All right because you're going to do something to get your income back up\nA without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work I get that part I'm not asking you to do that but I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that's not an equation I'm going to participate in\nA hurry because that usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in fear\nSo um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like that this was a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable step back and settling in

hot as my she just got to you got one\nIt kind of that that's how I feel that's probably not how she feels that off okay\nI'm not really in and out wherever 'cause that's not a good way to have a relationship but you should not make decisions together based on who makes the most money has the most ... that's not a good plan especially when one of use thirty and the other one's twenty two\nOkay so you got a little more life experience could we agree on that\nThat's right okay good and that's not to say she's in up to twenty two but in this case uh apparently she is so uh in in this particular subject so how are we going to do this you start talking about what we need to do\nWe don't need to go to the mall we don't need to spend so much money we need to get out that you started

with us from Boston, Massachusetts yeah Rodney how real\nFirst time caller Dave hey good to have your man how can I help do my wife and I we have zero day but\nWe um we have that on our house and we plan on how in the house next spring mhm should we pay on the house\nSo soon as soon as the weather breaks you putting us on the R\nWell yeah ... like four months\nProbably like may or June okay All right so like six months plus or minus All right um [noise] okay\nIt doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is if you put the money into a savings account and stood up a a lecture on the house\nAnd you have to like write yourself a note that shows like male yourself a letter that comes June first says if the house was not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a bass boat it wasn't a good plan [laughter] okay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchase if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house\nIf um if you're going to keep the hatch but for six months it doesn't matter\nTo the other part of my question would be ... sixty nine thousand currently in the house so say we don't know how much that America is he would you put towards the mortgage\nOn emergency fund she'll be three to six months of expenses I doubt that your expenses are that high ... you know okay so what would it take if you lost both of your jobs or what would it take for you ought to pay your bills for a month\nFor a long mhm um eat keep it alive and get all of that though it keep the lights on like our stuff I'd say three to four thousand\nOK so three to six terms terms four thousand six times four thousand twenty four thousand she'll twenty five thousand of the sixty nine is the most you should do\nOkay which leaves you about forty clear okay boy about forty five clear um and to throw at the house and what's the balance on the mortgage\nTwo hundred and eighty thousand okay yeah so hold that an an app to separate those two accounts by the way I'd have a twenty five thousand our account in a money market and not have a forty five thousand dollar account in the future house paid off house Fonda or paid off ... bond\nOkay if you don't put a sign in the yard by the first of June take that money on that account and put it on the house okay\nIf you awful and change directions in your decisions which are allowed to do you're an adult by the way our way my name is our winter who who's up okay Monica is a a well who's up just\nUp your mind I don't care [laughter] I'm getting signals from the booth that um we can't repeat okay boy [laughter] San Antonio [laughter] Wyoming what's up [noise] how's it going to have better service that's for sure how can I help\nIn sorry to interrupt the reason why I'm nervous because I'm not able to build it back up as fast as it started so it makes\nMe nervous to take a big chunk out okay how big is the choke may say about a third so twenty grand other sixty yeah okay\nWell the emergency fund is there in case there was obviously an emergency captain ... right so um but but if you think through your single\n\nUh yeah I'm divorced buy more stuff that I have a I have a son already but I did in case I re Mary mountain the option to have my captain and how old are you thirty nine\nOkay All right um\n\n[noise] there's two there's two things that are bumped into my head and they're ... they're they're both are working against each other okay so I'll just say I'm Out loud or the ... it was just process this together a little bit okay thing one is I tell folks not to use their emergency fund except for emergencies\nGuy thing too is this is very very very important\nTo you obviously it is and uh I mean it's it's and and you have a window of time you know a show I guess when I'm going to do is I'm going to shop around and and make sure I've gotten all the possible ways to pull this off his twenty grand the best\nMost efficient most reasonable most safe way is there a Fifteen\nGrand methodology is they're thirty five grand methodology is or other things that I 'cause I don't know anything about this at all um I mean other than the obvious to you know the higher level understanding of it but I'm\nBut I'm going to ... to gather more information anytime I'm buying anything for twenty grand I'm going to learn a lot and you may have already done all that but I'm going to I'm going to really push it on the research always the more options you have met when making a decision the better decision you always make you follow me during that time I'm also going to just be piling up cash like crazy\nLike my hair was on fire let's just keep adding an adding an adding an addict but the other thing that comes into my mind is forty thousand might be an adequate emergency fund for you\nAnd that's the ... this is not an emergency we could say that for sure but I\nFeel like I feel like it is it\nFeels like it is but it's not an emergency it's not a a it's not an unexpected event it's an elective\nLuxury that's very very very emotional and very very important ... and that's a reasonable statement but but I I think if I'm In your shoes I might declare forty thousand my emergency fund\n\nAnd then I'm okay 'cause I Want to catch most of what would come your way what kind of an emergency would come your way that would be more than forty thousand and extended unemployment will be the only one that would\nRight\nI mean or ... ... ... I mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nI Do but they won't cover it\nBecause I don't like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue you know that that would that lead up forty grams but it wouldn't be really wouldn't I mean you to get to forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay it and that's a lot that's that'd be a million dollar expense you know so I'd be very and I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process and this way because I'm trying to figure out a way to do it\nOkay I'm\nIn if you want a soup your emergency upon backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated a ... a principal the process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better is that logical to you I think so yeah I think though\nHave you got a good friends or family or pasture somebody counseling you and walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know not doing this in a variety of by yourself to do what I've been told they don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter]\nBye bye good counsel was that what you're saying\nNot necessarily good counsel\nBut friends and family say oh you know\nThe kids and families are wary about who have been crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our large yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you're not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council there's safety and that's what I'm looking for but I don't I don't hear anything holding me back here in your situation very interesting question though very interesting situation\nThanks for calling in and we appreciate you being a listener Rami is with us in Columbia South Carolina isn't rummy rummy\nThrow me high really high how can I help\nYeah I um I wanted to reach out to you I was on recently called call and buy a kind of a a major insurance provider and they were trying to sell me on a farm insurance products so I'd like you know turn insurance and a visibility which I agreed with and that I needed\nAnd um but I don't like the prices they quoted me were rather high so I went ahead and you know reached out to one of your recommendations and whatnot and got some uh some other quote that were a lot better mhm and ah and I reached back out to them and mentioned it to them and they had mentioned yeah well those are those are kind of like\nLetting those insurance companies aren't good they're on their their ratings not high financial you want to go with the home or hire expensive\nInsurance companies are going to they're going to be around in the next\nTwenty years you know I'm going to show you yeah I was like oh okay um so I Need to buy their he basically described as the Mercedes of ensuring the by said if you don't want to be in like a you know a Chevy yeah I thought I wanted to get your thoughts on that\nWell that's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are there are financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance they're\n... they're almost broke the state well let them sell in your state\nYeah they have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency you to do that number one number two if you have terminal life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nUnless you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kinda like if your car is your check the financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now I go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progressive goes broke you just get a different one you don't think about this progressive have the money to pay my claim you know but you can look at the AM\nBest rating of someone at Zander insurance is website and they are all financially solvent as much as a good word that sell any of the stuff that's a that's a complete lying to be asked Ron Rome is what it was\nOkay with that make you feel a lot better 'cause I yeah I went ahead and went with the the less expensive option anyways they say well I wouldn't because like I wouldn't do that from my family was like oh yeah you were a number and\nSelling insurance and by the way you called called me yeah [laughter] right right yeah that was when they called call your that tells you the one thing right there but [laughter]\nYeah yeah if you are doing investments with them if you were doing the whole wide life insurance with them which we don't recommend that you'd be a lot more concerned about the financial stability could you have a savings account\nThere then a that's a lot more important they would turn them not at all hardly\nBlake Thompson senior executive producer of the day for him to show this hour the show's over feel free to check out her YouTube

hashtags and the little things\n[noise] every couple of fake fall season law and said well\nAbout the clippers they traced Los Angeles clippers basketball on its official home [noise]\nIt's flippers count down and we are just forty eight minutes away from tip off in Houston the clippers are taking on the rock is for the second time in less than a week\nAnd coming up we'll have ... rivers on but right now it's Bryan seeming from age sound be how we're doing\nWe're doing good it's been a long time here in Texas we got here on a Wednesday Tuesday night and have been ready to play the rocket the rockets of actually play the game here since the time that we have been here so it's time to play some basketball and then we're all excited to get home if even if it's only for one game\nRockets struggling a little bit we'll get to them later in the show but right now the clippers late in games in that game it gets the pelicans we heard from doc rivers earlier they just did not execute well had to eat turnovers I Believe in that fourth quarter what happened there with the clippers kind of unraveling late Brian seem it\nYou know I wouldn't even say Adam they unraveled early as well their first aid possession Jeanette fourth quarter Adam resulted in five turnovers I mean\nAnd they just kept themselves behind the eight ball but yet some way somehow they were five points down with the ball in a hand in and then that's what the latest game execution that we're talking about it happened on both sides the ball and you know we\nMaybe it's just a comfort level um I I think the personnel was find out there we've seen that unit close out games um and those guys some of the most of those guys on the floor a veteran so\nI chalk it up to comfort level figuring everything out but some of that shot off and perhaps led to the defense of of the inability and and the public as we're able to score but\nYou know I felt like they played a C minus of a game and yet they are they are a tooth possession game with like four minutes to play\nI feel I'm going to try to make a silver lining for us out um I feel that once they get everything ironed out they'll be in those situations again it'd be more comfortable but you know they were able to execute down the stretch against Houston and Oklahoma City but\nTo me one or two games isn't going to complete that comfort level it's going to be a long time to what is it thirty games in my mind before everybody's really come together on the same job\nAnd the good thing is why the clippers are going through these growing pains I guess with so many players\nGetting used to being on the court with one another there still too into it gets really good teams in the western conference including the New Orleans pelican through some things\nAre playing the best basketball right now in the league to players though that continue to thrive with the clippers then you look ... they combine for fifty points how good are they all fence we Brian seem and when you're comparing I guess the other ...\nIn the NBA and you they need to be even better facilitators maybe for this clippers team is that possible\nYeah it might be possible as far as ranking them obviously ... there's a lot of guys ahead of them um but these guys for what this team is\nI think we're all happy to see them averaging right around twenty points a contest and\nYou know their net writing when they're on the floor together is very good the real facilitator book between the two of them is Denise ... so the more than he has the ball I think the more everyone else becomes a bit of a threat that there's no knock on wood bio terrorists who is a terrific team mates I just think Gallo has a plane making ability and quite honestly\nHe might be the first plane maker in that starting five keep in mind you've got to defensive minded\nA point guard in the back court with Bradley in Beverly guys I Love and I'm Glad they're they're taught at the center and then you've got kind of a score first mentality with Tobias Harris so\nI think the more Gallo has the ball maybe even in the high post the better the clippers could be offensive Lee but\nYou know they had a second unit to come in and and make some place that particular shade go just Alexander's really really good at it and they have yet to use 'em Milo stay a dosage and I think once you ... get out there I think that ball will start whipping around once again\nBecause you mentioned in there and people have been talking about it and doc rivers has been fielding questions about it they do have it in a defensive minded back court and people are wondering do they need to answer one of the play makers maybe is Shay guild is Alexander Milo say does this could there be any change later on\nAnd the season where we see someone else starting next to one of these defensive juggernaut like badger Beverly ... Bradley\nAbsolutely could see it um especially at the numbers continue to go the way they do go but it'll be interesting to see when I don't think if but when that shot returns for both of these guys we saw little hint of it\nWith pat Beverly in New Orleans you nearly at a triple double he'd look good it is very energetic the shot for a very has betrayed them so far but think about it this way if those shots are following their net rating now goes up exponentially we know what they're doing on the defensive side of things but down the road maybe\nYou know maybe they start those guys for defensive presidents and they bring one of the more play making point guard out there for a you know the rise to that first quarter the good news is they've got a lot of options keep knock on wood hopefully it stays that way but a ton of options here for doc rivers when last year there were none or will it\nBrian seeming go for now he'll be back in just a few minutes we are just about forty five minutes away from tip off between the clippers and rockets from Houston and coming up next we'll hear from the head coach doc rivers ... this is the clippers radio network [noise]\nPure celery shallow foreigners Chevy dealer home to in front of ... going off with technology to give you entertained and performance that makes driving by white now get sixty percent below MS RV fun at twenty nine Chevy when ... when your financial GM Financial\nThat's over forty eight hundred fellow MS RV\nHurry Southern California Chevy dealer and visited some cows shut these I'd go away for four fifty five Chevy for vehicle an offer he fails\nCity is it over with\nIf you want to make it in this league you can't just show up\nWith the dream you gotta wake up for the early morning and said for the late night\nSlippers dot com\n... are you know when you buy one of the nearly one million Americans living when parking and then there is no New York but you have the power to help change by\nBy participating in a clinical trial ...
