Lisa how are you\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up a quick question\nUm I I have a plan I'm from I'm I'm a\nRetirement from a job that I had ten years ago and I left the money in their arm is about twenty seven thousand dollars\nAnd it's I'm growing at an interest rate of five percent annual and\nI was going to leave it there until I retire if I can retire\nAt sixty two which is I can I'm Seventeen years [laughter] but I did the math and it's only gonna be sixty three thousand dollars by the time I turn the tide I take that money out and um I I just purchased a house to Seventy five when they take long so Mali note on that it's like\nEighteen hundred should I take that money out and refinance I can get a lower mortgage and then\nSame them different from the mortgage when I'm no\nNo I Would roll it to an IRA and pick out some good growth stocks mutual funds that have long track records of ten years or more you should be able to make twice what you're making all this money\nOkay like north of ten percent most of my mutual funds have averaged over twelve percent and you can pick mutual funds that have done that by getting with a good investment advisor that the teachers you you have to get someone with a heart of a teacher you don't just do something\nThey said do it or because somebody in the suits and do it\nWhich you sit down with them you learn how that works and you put it in good mutual funds and do what I already roll over from that money the way to find somebody to help you do that I'm not in that business but we have a group of people we recommend you can click on smart investor\nAt Dave Ramsey dot com and you put in your information that drops down a list of the smart investor prose the people that we recommend in your area and then you can select from among them\nAnd um I shut down with one of them and they'll talk to you and teach you and take your time learn about this\nGet comfortable with the idea but I think you can make a lot more on this money than you are making on it now and if you just pull it out you're going to get hammered on taxes\nAnd penalties for that matter [noise] em Ali is with us in Detroit Hi Emily welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHank day thanks so much for taking my call\nSure how can I help\nSo I have a question not as much rights outside for my parents my husband and I were introduced to Pierre and\nAbsolutely love that and we are just because they can to and we have a longer plan with a whole bunch of student loans that were just trying to well and it's probably going to take a few years and\nI guess he my parents thinking in that horrible kind of despair and being completely broke and overwhelmed jets or thing or have at the end though I just calling for advice on how\nHow I can influence them because they really like and I traveled there can even in my thirties now it doesn't matter it's like I'm Still okay\nAnd it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder dry but they don't really want your opinion\nAbout rank about money or sex okay and so the only time that reverses when they get really really really old and as I pointed out oh yeah yeah ... but um that you generally doesn't happen and so it you know it's like a friend that's being obstinate\nBecause you're both grown people you're grown your parents are grown\nAnd they're being obstinate about something and you just have to watch somebody that you would love to do self destructive stupid things like I've got a friend that's an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself if he doesn't go drink and\nI mean I Know I ... and I've talked to him people talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's anyone that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were ... mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and man I feel so much better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before and what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news\nA lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos as an agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton drew in through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit\nAnd it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels\nAnd you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example but we've vetted Obama when no one else would we would ... the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving opinion as part of what we do we're like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now\nAnd one thing that can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that when when something like this happens\nAnd all these Democrats are having these devices deliver to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the\nThe ah down below where they have to headline a boy with a reporter and it says that Trump opposition is getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump opposition\nThat that's the way that they're they're playing this so they're automatically putting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen\nI mean it it is it's it's it's such political um\nDistasteful rhetoric that when you\nCouple that with the things like McDonald's said\nWith the things that are these politicians are are instigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never it never has said anything that inflammatory and by and large\nThe reason his words or so or inflamed if not because of him it's because of CNN\nAnd MSNBC and the leftist politician that go out and\nPump it up to something that he never made it to be\nWhere we're gonna have to leave it there uh Jonathon Gillum author of sheep no more thank you Danielle McLaughlin attorney or and or soon to be\nA mom for I Believe the second

I Love it how much will be paid off\nHave my notes here I paid off about forty eight thousand two hundred dollars good for you and how long did that take twenty two months yeah eight and your range of income during that time I started off making Seventy and ended about making Ninety three thousand wow good for you what do you do for a living\nUh I oversee marketing for a software company and I also started my own company during the process\nThat okay good for you what kind of that was the forty eight thousand dollars what'd you say\nOh everything mainly student loans um I also had a student loan or a Carlin out I also had four one K. loan ...\nAnd then also had to pay some taxes to the IRS\nAmerica she like normal oh very normal a little bit of ... out there and just kind of bumping along yeah and I'm making decent money but got a big pile of debt and ...\nWell I I'm a travel junkie and so whenever I realized that can go on on the trip that I Want it and you know\nBroke and it kind of you know was horrible about being on a trip and not being able to for things to eat\nHere and so what happened twenty two months ago\nI was traveling with my boyfriend at times seemed to be my husband and I he the year before had paid for a trip for both of us to go to Costa Rica which was great yeah um so I was going to pay it back and say hey you know I'm going to pay for our turn next year ...\nUm and then realized I can actually afford is um airfare whoa I had to go down and say hey can you can you purchase your own airfare um so it was kind of that you know and then also thing and made good money\nAnd I couldn't do everything I wanted to do\nSo much too much money to be there's broke exactly yeah what'd you do\nUm I got really serious I actually read the total money make over about six years ago mhm end started to to become cause all intent started to understand some the teachings\nBut then um the twenty two months ago is really whenever kicked in going ... this is stupid why am I taking so long to get to that 'cause I had started and then stopped and then got back into it so that's when I write you know I had my lovely excel spreadsheet out to use the every dollar app I'm\nSo we started doing all that and plus my company started to um do smart dollar at all\nFor coming at the ... okay great so they talked smart dollar yep which is are going through the whole class as an HR benefit I drew company yes very neat and so that gave you about the time you were disgusted in good in Bonn airline ticket while law smart dollar appears from the charging\nYeah and actually um to circumvent and I and I think when we go through this process you start to get really creative ... one of my passions us to travel so I became a national speaker and had other people pay for my travel I was just working the entire time um but I still got to do a lot of my travel well also working on my income and\nYeah it's not bad at all I'm a professional eater I Wonder if they're going to pardon me for that\nYour prize why people pay for\nA no they ... when you get creative that's exactly right so the company teachers smart dollar you're going through it you get your income up with all the ... gigs you're traveling getting paid your software on the side you don't you're worth Ninety nine dollars an hour job and what is the secret to paying off forty eight thousand dollars worth of debt and twenty too much\nSo I Am a marketer um my one tad bit is don't pay attention to commercials or social media boat because that's the second you start to see the restaurants on commercials or the cool stuff that people are purchasing and showing off on social media you start to have that why should have with the Joneses ...\nGiven that you don't want to own things that are going down in value\nYou don't want a total of things going down in value more than half your annual income so that's the first measures do your cars all your vehicle's things with boats in motors and wheels ... add up to more than half your annual income if so then yeah you need to show something\nThe second thing is can you be dead free everything but your house and a year I'm Sorry in two years within two years if you can busted\nTaking extra jobs so so much stuff that kids think their next beans and rice rice and beans don't see the inside of a restaurant unless you're working there are no vacations busted and be debt free scorched earth and the debt free\n\nIn less than two years then you would keep your car even if you owe more on it then it's actually worse there's going to pay it off and you're going to clear it and you're going to own it it's going to be\nAll through all done right that's where we are going to end up you know\nIf you owe more on your car then it's actually worth and you can't it's going to be more than half your on your income and or you can't pay it off inside of two years then you do need to sell it how do you sell a car that you're upside down on that you owe more on your car than his were in that case if you need to sound like you've got to cover the difference\nYou owe twenty thousand dollars on the car the car is worth sixteen you can sell it for sixteen but you've got to have the other four to put with the sixteen to get the title from the bank in order when you give the title to the ... in order to give the title to the new owner\nAnd so where are you going to get that other four thousand dollars if you're upside down by four thousand dollars well you would have to in that case\n\nBorrow the four thousand dollars saved the four thousand dollars or talk to the current Linder on the car and letting you sign a note for the four thousand dollar difference that will only happen if you had like a credit union or a local bank\nIt won't happen with a big bank our car loan company General Motors credit is not going to do that\nLexus motor credit is not going to do that and so on something that is what you do hope that helps\nPhones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money John is with us in Detroit hey John how are you\nDave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I thank you for taking my call it an honor to speak to you um my wife and I are avid planners and we are planning our next move here in the next few years I'm forty nine and she's forty six\nWe don't have kids um and we're thinking about moving to the Las Vegas area over the next\nTwo possibly three years we've probably got a plan beforehand mhm I'm my question to you if we're looking and because we do a lot of travelling um ourselves and so we're not sure it looking at a condo\nOr and actually having a home would be a good idea what's your what's your opinion on Congo um 'cause we are planning on whatever we purchase we're planning on paying a fine for that we eat you know have no market\nAnd that's good okay so my opinion on them regarding what value increases are what\nWell uh you know facing the threat but because let's say we we buy a condo I'm looking out over three hundred thousand um it must be doing with our colleague thousand or something like that\nIf they don't waste of money um to to to go into account of versus a home that sure what the white financial interaction would be\nWell no it's it's not a waste of money um the benefits are as you said you don't have to deal with the exterior maintenance and when you're traveling you've got neighbors that are close and if something curves obviously you could\nYou know or have the next door neighbor or the ... the person near you have a key and that kind of a thing there's a lot of possible good things about owning a condo as far as they as far as a condominium increasing in value\nA everything that controls the value increasing on real estate there there's three things location location location right right and and so is it or is it a condominium and a good area\nMeaning to an area that's a stable growing that values are increasing a good neighborhood to neighborhood people considerably a desirable place to live\nA ... and so I Want to I Want to buy a condominium in a fairly established area or in an area that is you know right on the edge of\nA rapidly growing edge of an established area that kind of a thing from from a ... British resale standpoint okay and um you know if you do that you're going to get similar growth in value to what you would in a single family in that same neighborhood\nSame families do a little bit better there's a little bit more market for them and there is condos but you know a ... if you're in an area that's accepting of condominiums you'll be fine in Vegas will be fine with that now having said all of that then the only downside is what you mentioned earlier\nAnd that is the H away and the handling of the budget of the choice I Would want to investigate because you are a planner\nThe budget and um how they're doing with the H away budgeting let me give me an example I had a condo come I own a rental or a many years ago when a condo complex that they had budgeted no reserves to replace the roof\nOkay now the condominium association is responsible for the exterior maintenance which would include the roof replacement so they come up with a several million dollar problem because the roads are going bad\nRight and they done no planning to get rid of it so guess what they did a special assessed every body and the place in addition to their age away fees to keep because they had to have Ruth stinking thing as Lincoln all over the place exactly but that devalued the condo in book took cash out of everybody's pockets\nOkay and so if you look up and they've got no reserves for parking lot replacement no reserves for exterior maintenance no reserves for roof replacement in their budget\nAnd you know and you're looking at a complex is ten years old you got a problem you're walking into and so that any of the thing you want to look at their the deferred maintenance is hidden down in that age I weigh reserves budget\nThe second thing you're going to run into is a and I'm In a bunch of ... on a bunch of real estate I hate H always right generally speaking the people that want to be on in charge of the ... way or the people that are in charge of nothing else anywhere else and their Barney Fife\nThey would drive you freaking nuts absolutely and there are people that need a life\nNow there's exceptions to that but by and large or you're going to run into a lot of that\nBut yeah I'm currently currently live at home or the thought is right now and I'm the president of yeah so they [laughter]\nBasically [laughter] I stayed at are you [laughter] know I said\nAt the typically because I didn't want to run in a firefight kinda fits your weight and very very guy\n[laughter] okay [laughter] well God you say\nYeah there there's a lot of that it's not it's not a hundred percent truth thank goodness\nAnd hopefully your last you know I don't know about it all [laughter] but that's what you want to watch for is the politics\nOf the association I'm In one eye joys of federal suing each other and it's just on the whole neighborhood just melting down you know just ridiculous and so it it you got it and that's what you could get into you if you're the president associates she already knew all the stuff I was just talking about them as far as I'm\nEven reserves in a situation things that are that you've got to have reserves income\nPreserved cover and so that's all you gotta look for [laughter] that's fabulous this Ramsey show\nGuys this is James child producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now carried on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you got to Dave Ramsey dot com bust show [noise]\n... and here you ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire it's impossible these days\nOr people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families will we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and the simple truth is everyday people become millionaires all the time\nHow did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently and with the help him guidance of a professional\nThat's where our team has already done the hard work for you\nWe've vetted and interviewed thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals get started today go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart dresser and look up the smart coastal pros or in your area\nAnd confident\nMhm okay so here's the situation I think you've got more talented than that I Want you to do an exercise where you spend a little bit of alone time today while it's fresh in your mind I Want you to ride out several skills that you have because you have more skills than just being able to talk well\nAre you you you you you started a business and sold you started a fourteen and sold it I think you're thinking way too hard and I want you just release your brain right out the top three or four things you do best\nAnd then I Want you to go over to the passion side work that you just enjoy you find yourself even as a small task around the car if I was going to pay you tomorrow to just be around cars what would you want to do all day and just begin to to to let your mind run and make a list of three or four of your top passions things that you enjoy to do\nAnd I want you to sit down with somebody who knows you very very well and there's also a truth telling your life and we want them to be able to verify and confirm both of those list the reason is is because I think you need a jolt of confidence\nAnd and you you're very special young lady who's done something pretty amazing at the age of twenty three and I think you're just you're over thinking\nAnd I think you need to get somebody else in your life will show you a mirror and you come away go okay I get it so back to that talent passion calm but once you get clarity on that it's how do I use those top skills to do work that I Love\nAnd and and if that's involving cars great\nBut maybe just maybe you know you love talking to people about cars and help them get get in a new car do you get a lot of joy when you sell a car to somebody how yeah how do you feel when they walk off a lot and they're pleased how's it make you feel\nThat if you get fresh air\nYeah so I think if you're looking long term to start a business I'd stay in that space I'd be thinking about how are you can continue this idea [noise] um and and maybe expand a little bit but what you're doing is is when I ask you this direct questions you're having a hard time identifying some specific things\nAnd this is important I think there's a lot of people out there in the same boat we get this we get this on on the can culture quite a bit\nAnd there is some type of limiting belief\nThat is holding you back when you can't quickly say these are some things I Do well\nBecause here's what I Know if I sit down with people who know you will and I interviewed them about you those of you that are listening right now that have a hard time seeing all this is this is a talent these are my top town when I sit with those people they're going to tell me areas that you are good\nThings you do well\nAnd there's something that's holding your back and walk and you up\nIs it that some buddy verbally abused you did you have a failure in your life at some point that has made you believe that you don't have much to offer\nFolks who deal with this every day and some of the out there are locked up on that one limiting belief\nAnd when you get beyond that realize wait a second I have something to offer I have something to give then you begin to allow yourself to truly identify\nWhat it is that you do well and worked it makes your heart come alive\nSick a question from Facebook Rachel rights and should I take a lower paying entry level job it is the first step toward a new career path that would eventually lead to a higher salary if so should I Do this while still in baby steps to or should I wait until after baby steps or this is a great question\nSo if the answer is you would take a pay cut\nBy taking the entry level job which is what she's saying here's a lower paying entry level jobs in less you can handle that\nI Would wait until you get baby step three done that entry level job

large portion of Americans Seventy percent to be a latest to give you the latest data from Gallup Seventy percent of Americans disengaged at work and so if that's huge today could be the day that you call in and let's get you some clarity so that you can constantly step forward on the path to fulfilling your\nPurpose through your work and courageously staying there that's what clarity does clarity gives us confidence to step out\nAnd didn't clarity allows us to have courage once were on that path in life throws its curves at us because it will and uh you could just be assured of that and yet when you face the doubt and fear and the pride it is where you retreat back to clarity\nWho am I what was that created to do simple formula that we use\nWhat do you do best when you're ... what do you love to do most what work brings you enjoy\nThe sweet spot for everybody exist where your greatest talent you read his passion intersect in other words I use what to do best to do what I Love new most and here's the deal folks as I told my callers every day I don't have the answers you do\nThey're inside of you the answers to this somewhat mystical journey or actually within you you have so if you're scared if you're confused stuck give us a call triple eight\nEight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Nelson who's on the line in Fall River Massachusetts Nelson how can a\nHey Ken thanks for taking my call German not gonna\nI'm All right so I'm going to show for a while and uh I figured out my sweet ... which is ... apparently it um creating an editing are found either okay and a wife or you could\nTalk committee a practicable okay um [noise] if I can research has found a video of marketing firm real close to me and uh I kept him out on Lincoln and you know they're ... they're linked to a buddy of mine that I have no school\nAnd I'm I'm here to to get some coach Janna where screwed up because it's a very universe get heard my call and you gave your great ...\nAlso will have you talk to your buddy that are that is like at least connected to this company on linked in\nA I I haven't spoken about their uh you know work quote nearby\nOkay well that's the first the first step is calling up saying hey uh I'm interested in learning more about this company I see that you're connected them on linked in what is your connection how strong is it that's the first thing\nBecause he could have a strong connection or maybe it's just a random connection or it's an old ... ... you see what I'm saying so you are in um urine staged too and that is full on research and so you found and identified one company that does what you want to do\nYou mentioned the proximity principle to the Dave Ramsey show letters you haven't heard that it's important to clarify what that is proximity of the proximity principal says in order to do what I Want to do in this case\nNelson wants to do a film an audio editing production work so in order to do that he's got to be around people that are doing that and in places that it is happening so here you're next steps after you talk to your buddy and see how strong connection is\nThe next thing you want to do is I'd like to see you come up with a a bigger list even if it's three or four local production companies\nOr or companies that are in this space okay 'cause you know where to look in your area so look and ideally I'd like to see a list of three or four companies that you we circle and say I need to learn more about those companies\nI Need to get in proximity now the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances or who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take them out to lunch or take 'em to coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is the place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your past\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow up what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available because Nelson this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation let's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nOh you're you're sort of get used to have no liquor Monday's critic and that's really what I Want to do and I want to work from a federal amount I just don't know how to make the jump from well even my current job on not excited about it all to go on to the mall or their career and that is completely in a different field that has nothing to do with what I'm currently doing\nGotcha okay well let's talk about where you want to end up you want to eventually on your own business so let's let's identify that dream what is that\nI'm currently is kind of I Know it got to focus on one thing but I'm I'm a ... of have a degree and work of element and I have a passion for development Web design or create websites companies and I'm just doing maintenance work up in the years\nUm but I also have a big passion of uh Dave Ramsey teachings and I've done the financial coach must return them and I would like to open market practices you know maybe financial coaching on the side and I'm just a completely different I'm not going to focus on one thing I just don't know\nExactly I should be focusing on right now and and I know it's hard for somebody to give me that after\nNo well I think you have the answer I think you know the answer I'm gonna put you on the spot okay\nSo I Know that you're passionate about Dave Ramsey needs help change your life and so you'd love to help others get some of that change that's what's really drawn to that but I I I and I think that's fine I think you have multiple passions link passions could be on different levels and I think you could maybe do some coaching on the side for extra money\nBut I heard you can clearly and definitively say that you've always loved designed and Web design and I think that that's the work that brings you great joy if I could snap my fingers and give you a job
