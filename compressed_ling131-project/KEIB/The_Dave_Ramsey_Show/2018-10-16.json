like yourself I'm not sufficient [laughter] tell my story well I'm twenty three months ago\nWell first of all I just thank God I found yet\n[noise] um well I'm I'm\nBut this is my two ten dollar and a half from Costa Rica and my friends to live in a infant on Saturday does that come in to support me wow and not being a single parent since my ...\nAnd I'm obviously his father's amazing and he supported aspect financially it's been a big struggle mhm [noise]\nUm so we took in um southern students to try and help me and if my income which is the son and um it really helped me that and\nI spent many names just looking at my income and my aunt ... and a very stressful there just wasn't enough money what happened twenty three months ago so twenty three months ago and I got into um a lot of debt\nAnd and that was maybe my downfall was when my bank gave me now is the cost ... or ... thousand pounds whoa yeah and at the time I thought I'd won the lottery because I didn't have an image she signed\nAnd I had a lot of 'em get the news to the new St critic count and not you say I felt like I'd done something that I hadn't actually done anything I just made my day from one place to another mhm [noise]\nPeople do stuff like that that's fine but this idea you go about Seventy five eighty a hundred thousand dollar fifty thousand or a mobile home and call that a good long term plan no it's not a good long term plan it goes down in value it's simple\nI had a buddy of mine owns a huge mobile home operation and he's always give me a hard time would you say you're going to do and I said well they want to which we Andrew I Would say in it we've got some that go up in value on it when when when I see that as an across the board thing yeah\nNo I Will tell you that's manufactured housing is what they always call it one way or the other there's all kinds of manufactured housing sometimes that means mobile home sometimes that means the wall system for building a factory there stood 'em up and it basically looks like a stick built a house\nAnd so it's treated by the purchasing public\nLike a traditional home\nWhatever you're buying well I don't care what words you use to describe but the question you ask yourself is when I woke up in front of it do I say mobile home\nOr do I say house if you walk up in front of it and you say how ugly house pretty house but it's a house right\nThen then that's going to go up in value in a mobile home with the wheels off sitting on a concrete foundation that looks all permanent still looks and feels like a mobile home when you walk into it\nAnd as long as people think it was that it's not a house is not going to go up in value because that's how the market perceives it\nAnd that's what you've got to look at so whatever you're putting into that you're throwing that money away\n... ... what do you think about living in a mobile home for a year to save for a down payment if you're doing that five thousand are mobile homes and won't pay cash for it and live there for a year while I save up some money that's fine because you're just given up you know some of the five thousand dollars not turning not allowing fifty thousand on something that's now worth\nThirty where you get upside down and the thing um\nOr if you're talking about renting something that's what you want to do sure whatever wherever you want to rent okay rich cheap rent is cheap as you can rent does that means you can save more for your dumb James's in Lexington Hi James how are you\nHey I'm good thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nUh

Ryan read it in two days and I said yeah let's go ahead and I'm not a reader [laughter]\nAnd we just got after it and it took us thirty month to pay off that initial fifty five thousand dollars a net ... and then we've built our emergency fund and started getting after our house you know and not really believing we were going to pay off the house\nI'm as quickly as we did but uh even when life got in the way we just kept sticking to the plan and here we are\nAnd we're just incredibly proud of where we're at\nYou ought to be well I mean if you have a guard rails you know if you're bumping up against them yeah so I got I got a game plan here where the houses the house and you get knocked out a little bit then you get back up at school houses the houses the house and enter your ten years later you started when you're twenty eight and every thing is paid for you don't have a single\nPayment now how's that for you\nIt while I was just thinking this morning as um I don't know when when bill day comes around it so fast 'cause there's nothing to pay for yeah yeah it's awesome build day\nAnd we were able to ah you know start putting that money towards the future and dreams rather than a choice we made fourteen years ago and the other it's just a huge blessing if you've got\nYour future standing around your kids your retirement and uh your your wealth building your generosity that's all future now they're still paying countrywide wanting to go you guys very fun who was the mortgage with\nA it was with country and I got a bunch of ... and I had a few different ones along the way they bonds earlier good for you guys so you said you've led classes financial ... over this ten years so now that you are the coordinator those paid off her house people look at you like [noise] wow yeah\nMy hero yeah how do you do that what do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giants stuff at the end\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the ties in um well it's really cold I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving a church like boys what we're given what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away it's we've learned how to live\nHave joy within our means and once you hit that point it's um it just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nTurn around and borrow more student loans because you don't have the courage to go to school you didn't gain any ground your just\nSo I mean first thing we got to do is make sure you have enough to pay cash is that what you're talking about that you're going to have an up and pay some down the student loans or what\nOr that's what I was trying to figure out if I have a foul something that you know twenty grand between now and next fall when I go back to school and I've got an eye on the loan so I didn't know said\nWell I think the first thing is what is the first thing the first call is complete school be a hundred percent sure have way more than enough to complete school with no new debt now when do you finish school at the end of next year\nIt'll take a call about a year and a half\nAnd your degree will be in what\nA businessman and committed\nOkay and I'm\nWill that move you up in income immediately or are you working now what's your story\nYeah I've been I've been in and out of school I've got a management job now but I don't really see it being able to advance to me it's like a higher leadership off all that kind of my reasoning for one could go back to school to finish\nOkay well it's it's not a bad thing to finish up what you're doing I think that's about a good plan but yeah the the first goal is to finish with no new debt and make plenty sure you got plenty more than enough to do that but let's say that you add it up and you say I Need twenty thousand dollars to finish all of my school\nAnd then you save up thirty thousand and then you save up\nAnother ten thousand I wouldn't I mean Thirty's more if twenties all you need thirties plenty that gives you a pad then everything above that you start paying off the debt if you got really really end of the money you see what I'm saying but I mean I wouldn't be I wouldn't have two dollars extra I'd want a little extra to make sure you get through school with no new debt\nThat your first big goal now when you get out of school then we're going to attack this debt with a vengeance\nAnd that's going to be the process but um that that that's just what we tell people don't don't go further in is your first call Jeffrey as in Atlanta Georgia Hi Jeffrey how are you\nHow you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] I made a I work for a company that had the weakest point where I Would be paying if I give to the program I Will be paying one twenty I pay period or maybe they're just leave the program but\nThey weren't going right car manufacturer yeah where do you work or what do you work for a BMW okay that is not a normal leasing program this is an Employee Benefit okay and it is excellent because they furnish the car at a\nCost that there's there's no way you could have hardly any car for no more than you're paying I mean ... to ... you said two hundred and forty dollars right as three thousand dollars a year okay if you bought that car it will go down three thousand dollars and twenty minutes in value\nEither you see what I'm saying so that is a bargain and do they not they furnished liked a Tarzan oil and stuff to say Yes sir\nIs the gas even furnished and that they can't remember no no no [laughter] there's one on one of the car manufacturers emerged but\nIt's it's ... it's ... it's all the maintenance and the tires though right\nEverything is the insurance and that to you after see that's a deal of deal I mean you can't buy the tires and the insurance for three thousand dollars a year\nAfter but that's not a lease that's not like a standard okay they call it a lease but it's more of an employee benefits in other words BMW is losing money\nOn this transaction with you to your benefit because you're an employee it's an employee benefits either and they want their employees driving one of their fine automobiles and you guys do make a fine automobile so I get there yeah and I\nIf I remember ... you have what a selection that for that is that the price of a certain car or is that the price of a car up to a certain amount\nAnd you know the life of a car\nOkay the one that you liked or whatever yeah okay All right we'll do it's a deal I mean seriously you know you can't hardly buy insurance for that\nGot much less the tires and maintenance much less less about the loss in value but that's different than Joe walking off the street and leasing that car which he did it probably seven hundred dollars a month okay\nYou know and that would not be a good deal he should maybe by a BMW if he's got a lot of money and pay cash for it because it's a good car but you're you're getting an Employee Benefit and it's a sweet deal for you I Would definitely do that if I work for beamer\nIt's a bargain it's a great deal and are there are several of the car manufacturers that have really good deals for their employees but you just kind of have to think about it of if I was driving\nYou know if you're driving ten thousand dollar car man you can't do that for three thousand dollars a year\nWith what we're talking about here and you're certainly not driving up ten thousand dollar car what we're describing your probably driving forty thousand dollar car\nSo a good question man thank you for calling in and in a again it was a great deal appreciate your joining us Amy is on Twitter at Dave Ramsey is there an item or items that you refuse to pay for or by\nEven though you could afford it now\nYeah sure I can\nAfford most anything I Want to do nowadays I mean not anything but most anything and some things just feel weird to me I feel I just don't want to have that invested in that\nUm I've got a friend that's worth um\nTens of millions of dollars and he's a watch guy and he bought a um a hundred and fifty thousand dollar watch which sounds just nuts but I mean he's got like ... million dollars that's a it's like most people ... okay I can afford to do that it just I just\nI don't know it's not me number one and and I um I I might spend that on a boat [laughter]\nBut not on my watch so I mean I was just being authentic with you you know but\nUh uh so\nThe boats bigger than watch does that count [laughter] so yeah it just it's something that hits me funny but it's not really a value Judgement\nTo say that my point is is that I'm not mad at him for spending that on and watch he's got two hundred million dollars\nAnd if he spends a hundred and fifty grand and watches nothing okay that guy's got plenty of money it's like most people bought a biscuit he gives away his his generosity runners artist huge he helps lots and lots of hurting people and that's a very very small percentage of his world but emotionally I have trouble\nEven though intellectually I can get there and I'm not judging him emotionally yeah I I Would struggle doing that um but that doesn't mean it's wrong to do it just 'cause I Can't grasp it\nAh emotionally it it would be wrong to do it if it's a high percentage of his world and that's why we tell people like on your cars and stuff don't get into a high percentage of your\nYou know your your financial world where you've got you know you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year and you've got eighty thousand or for the cars well that's just stupid\nThat I can make a value Judgement on that does not emotions is just mathematically dumb but when something is a small percentage of your world there are still some things that emotionally you just don't feel right about but it doesn't mean that it's a more immoral for someone else to do it as my point\nAnd so and really a lot of you could learn that lesson 'cause some people judge other people because they can't emotionally\nGrasped that [noise] and just because you can't emotionally grasped something doesn't mean it's morally wrong there's a difference here and so anyway this is a good question I talk about a lot of that kind of stuff and the legacy journey book only book I've ever written about well\nYou know the books I've written about money in something that puts this hour that I've Ramsey show in the books we will be\nFine which
