dreaded thirty thousand ...\nSo it's pretty equally divided between student loans and both of our cars okay and we want to mention that in that Thirteen months we had to hit pause on our debt snowball twice and three months into it on fourth of July\nOr I or I unfortunately was celebrating a little too much and uh\nApparently I had a pen decided this and I thought it was more than something different so I thought it was bad food\nAnd every ... and I had to get my appendix removed so that put us on a screeching halt yeah wow yeah so that was an emergency surgery that we had to cash so long and we did but everything on pay that off\n... started up again we're back at it filling out our our thermometer and six months later lucky me I had kidney stones so yeah so I had a double whammy

gone back to work some attorney leave ... and we always plan of big annual trip and\nHaving him we thought oh well go do at Disney cruise or something and\nI are planning that trip and then I kind of stressed out because we only had maybe three thousand savings and them just didn't sound right\nAnd we knew that you are his parents actually given us I think your home DVD ... when we got engaged okay Manhattan but it just didn't click back then and then watch them no no well as early as we know we watch them that we stopped at a ... and just didn't stick to it on our\nCell and I knew that you went on line found that you had an ad and I had about an hour and a half hour commute each way to work\nYou know I listen to your podcast and I\nYeah I heard you tell a capital that was on that too that they're ... they can't go to any vacations and that's when it's ... like we can't do any of that stuff we need to\nReally tackle down half our debt so that's when\nI came home to him and tell them no vacations we're going to get started\nTo which he was really excited to go all the sudden I was like dang a payout of pay off dead or go golfing and Florida Keys or something I'm like ooh [laughter] our choice I guess is that I I Am\nBut the good news is you're out of debt now and I'm like no one else later you can ... it was like no one was you know what he's all people the key to getting out of that as you paid off thirty thousand and Thirteen much\nFor me at that budget sticking to the budget wheeling they'll budget that we never I'm stuck to it to them that always change we knew we had extra cash to redo than spontaneous spending\nAs a planning for each month happened and loves the every dollar Applebee's it all the time cool and so yeah I just sticking to that budget and planning ahead and just delaying sunnier and things that you'd want and just waiting on them\nYeah and for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way they approach or this debt free journey right Lindsey over here she's an expelled guru in geek in loves\nTo see a split out I'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in the whole thing and get me to the top ... more goal driven in that but we do it All right but on the refrigerator right when we are on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in debt is kind of like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous\nNow this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt\nI Am not I was our way of being honest and I end up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo to people look at your luck curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nYou know and it was a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nEither way you do have a hired adoptable with a nature essay and they lower premium as a result\nBut you'll have to just find out what they're offering do they have a hundred percent pay after the ... um and if they do and you're healthy or you're sick\nEither one it comes out better kind of in the middle it doesn't necessarily come out better but if you're going to go through the ... the doctor will every year and then they pick up a hundred percent that's a great deal if you got like a chronic illness\nAnd or if you're hardly ever sick Ramsey is knock on wood we hardly ever\nEnd up at the dock then in that case\nObviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to the doctor ... so we just end up with a cheaper premium is what ends up with us and the ability to put money into\nThe health savings account which creates a tax deductible account and you can use that money of course to meet your ducked ... or any other\nHealth issues that you want to cover as you go along so good question though to talk to you Annette thank you for calling in Dennis ... says in Rochester, Minnesota Hi Dennis how are you\nWilling or Salter\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well my wife and I started your program back you know and um we've been working on what you're wearing beggars took to\nUm we have some whole life life who serves policies um each of our parents took a flight from shirts on us when we were younger we still have those policies and then when we got married we each took out a policy for the whole life I'm a cashier\nAre you on the policy is about a lovely house in dollars mhm and we were wondering if we should cash out the policy is after getting a her policy and use that money to put into our that's noble\nAbsolutely\nYeah they're horrible product they're just um you know the whole life has to payday lender of the middle class I mean it just as a\n... a ridiculously low rate of return on your money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value the policy they don't pay the the cash value also which means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears at death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad bad product the math on it is horrendous and you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance and do your investing anywhere except in a life insurance product and so\nUm that's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\nWhere there'll be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the other words what you paid into it it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't ride the law but you end up with having put more into it\nThen you get out so there's no game now\nWe have um and it happens about five percent of the time with an old with a very very old whole life policy\nThere it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you do you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nBut in Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck you don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not a taxable event when you lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nHide it I'm doing good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nA number and then I guess I married next August and we're combining our finances and everything else [noise] um\nAnd we're working on paying off all I think that we get paid off his car like three days ago Hervey yeah mine should be paid off by the end of this year which is great and the next thing we're going to tackle as um I made for happy hour\nAnd then after that was good I tell the markets that we live and so why planning on saving up to three to six months if I can say fine but we're not sure how much we can save ...\nWhere two income family obviously we have no kids on but if they thought that my cannot leave and my rental property fat out require like really different amount that if I have had and how we're trying to figure out how much safer like how\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff break down on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account free rentals digging out\nI can match out of work that\nOkay I Would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and put pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there put the rents in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rentals 'cause what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxed boy cheer\n'em because everything else is going to be deductible all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account\nTo cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I might keep that to do it that way and separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business right off okay and then over but then at home I Would have three to six months of expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rentals covered in the rental account than you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of household expenses as your\nHas your game
