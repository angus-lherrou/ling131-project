I can I T yeah she said okay so you like technology yeah\nAll right well um I I think the first go before you go start your education process is you need to have an idea of what you're going to study because that will change the answer to your question that you asked okay so let's say for instance that you wanted to be a Web\nProgrammer and um I've got folk guys on my team that make 'em in excess of a hundred thousand dollars well in excess of that ... that are right ruby on rails code\nOkay not I'm not a bad career\nAnd uh that's an example of an ... type of thing okay and Web programmer writing code now if you're going to do that you would not need and it would not be preferable for you to get a four year degree in information technology that's not necessary to do that\nYou would need to take some classes on how to code and you'd want to learn you\nKnow some of the basic IT things and so I Would probably direct you towards a vote tech type school a which is probably a two year degree while you're studying and everything that and I would tell you to work your tail off in the technology field uh and if you can\nUh you know bring coffee for people who are doing code and just watch over their shoulder and learn from them and hang out from them and you're a new hobby is hanging out with people who are world class code riders voters then uh you know and you're taking some classes that'll get you and they're more than a four year degree will get you and then it's a lot cheaper\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say are cheap but you could change your mind about I'm ... I'm not going to do I T I Want to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specialization in marketing or finance or something like that and in that case the answer would be different on how to pay for it here's the thing you one of the number one\nCarefully select what it is you want to study and that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whatever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to start the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is college\nCost is the number one cause of student loan debt\nMayor and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck\nBoth our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall\nParticularly the life insurance world and anytime you hear a gimmick it's almost always a good idea to run\nYou know your ears on the one you should have long term disability insurance\nEveryone should have long term disability insurance\nIf unless you are in an industry where each such high risk and you just it's nutty it cost you ten thousand dollars a month to have it you can't 'cause you you know you're\nA high rise window washer or something like that right you can't get long term disability insurance but other than that everybody ought to have long term disability insurance for most of the time you can get it through your work and it's not that expensive if you have long term disability insurance\nDon't buy wave your premium\nOn your life insurance\nAll that does pay your life insurance premium for you if you become disabled so what is that it's a little tiny baby miniature\nLong term disability insurance policy salt is and it's very expensive one very expensive\nIt'd be better off to use that same amount of money to increase the coverage of your existing long term disability or help you buy it if you haven't bought it yet and you heard me today and you need to get long term disability\nOr you go just like that again gimmicks they're everywhere particularly around the life insurance world and just buy insurance oh you know one on friends with the\nNobel Prize with that I just wanted a hamburger note on friends with your friends with it there's always an upgrade there's always an upset stay away from it Benjamin is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how're you\nDoing great how are you today better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] have a question for you my wife and I are currently working on baby step to uh we have one more quote unquote non mortgage debt to pay off what should we paid off by the end of the year in bill have um [noise] that is technically it's technically a mortgage because we bought a house to use it a rental\nSo that would allow you to write so I didn't know if it's for rental um if that still considered a debt and should be paid off as part of baby step to six\nOr we should move that not six year mortgages are insects okay even if it's not my home\nEven if they're not your or the rental even if you're home because it's usually it's typically you know most people listening if they have a rental property it's a large that\nAnd we're we're done with the baby step to as we're getting rid of all the ... and or consumer debt some numbers are large but ah we're trying to get rid of all of that and that really gives you a huge amount of cash flow to do baby step three finish your emergency fund for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and five kids college in six\nOr we'll go ahead and pay the mortgage off or out on the rentals and our personal residents Emily is with us from Cincinnati Hi Emily how are you\nHow about yourself\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um my husband and I\nWe sold our house and purchased a um try rental flash home we buy a horse farm and so we are renting out the horse farm facility but living in the house and what we're renting out paying our mortgage mortgage a very large now\nAnd I'm kind of panicking about I don't like that at all [laughter] but my husband is looking at it as a business and investment um and I want to pay it off really act that we've heard that we don't want to pay that off very it got the tape that that\n...

I mean I'm not kidding I'm terrible at math my brains are wired in a way to be able to break in algebra problem down but Katie you are good at solving problems correct\nCorrect All right so that is a starting point now what work have you ever dreamed about doing or you just wonder if this would be amazing if I could do this at some point in your life you wondered about something what'd you wonder about\nWhen I was a kid I wondered about no rocket ship and you know getting in the face and you know what would it take to get them up and you know the whole NAFTA mhm idea when I when I was a kid was really fascinating\nOkay so here's what we've got we're not going to solve it on this call but Katie here's what you've got you've got a starting point to go take those homework questions I gave you the people that know you can get the answers and here's what you're going to find\nYou're going to find that there are some patterns and there are some themes that continue to develop so there's already Christie a tie between being good in math and being fascinated by rockets\nBecause every NASA person I've met a lot of men about four or five every one of them very good math and science so you're beginning to develop some themes here and you're beginning to see some patterns now for you you have a very specific challenge you need to work ideally from home so this is on line work\nThis maybe are not available to you and an online forum but the reality is is that you begin to discover different jobs that you would enjoy because it allows you to do things that you're good at like ... like the science like the problem solving and then you begin to see things wish I could I enjoy that because I'm good at it but I Know you run it is a lot\nYou know here's the thing Katie I just want to speak to you from mom to mom it's so easy to lose herself and mother had\nLike I hear that voice and you have like I don't know I felt like I've lost myself it's so easy to become consumed with your kids consumed with supporting your spouse it's so easy to do that but actually encourage exactly like cans that you're still in there\nYou're still in there you're you're things that make you come alive does things that you weren't good at are still good at maybe have just lost touch with are still in there and so it's going to take a little bit of self reflection and discovery just like Ken said oh I heard you that\nI I wrote in my book business for ... five e questions that help you know your strengths them in a given to you really quickly what do you enjoy\nWhere do you excel what do others encourage any what gives you energy and what types of things come effort less to you\nAnd your answers to some of those questions will start to lead you in the direction of your strengths exactly like Ken's talking about and you can ask other people or what do you know what what are the patterns of what people say hey you're so good at that are man you oughta you got to do that for a living you know what are the things where you excel in relation to other people just like Ken said what are you good at I Know you're good at things\nSo sometimes we get really overwhelmed with identifying our strengths we get all squirming like oh I just wanna be humble and not good at anything but you know what if God made you good at something Katie own it and lean into that and I think as you start to explore this those questions that can gave you talking to people and just remembering and having confidence you are still in there\nEven though you love those kids like crazy or you're still in there and you can lean into those things that make you light up and I know you will and I'm proud of you and I'm excited for you 'cause it's at the beginning of that discovery thing can was just talking about\nYou know there's a lot of doubt there because you heard in her story a lot of people listening under you experiences with with your tribe she supported her husband she did everything to help him\nAnd what happens is and then you become a mom and all of a sudden you feel like well I'm serving everybody else you know where to go there's just nothing or did I mean where

questions your career questions you stuck or you're confused scared got an idea you're ready to launch but needs some advice from Christie we're here for you Tripoli eight to five five two to five let's go to Katie who's on the line and St Paul Minnesota Katie how can we\nHi hey can I could see I'm honored to speak with you know ... ... you might have for me I forgot I married no problem I married three kids I work about four to five job primary and the architecture field 'cause\nI'm In the primary breadwinner right now and they cited and about what I Do my passion architecture and there has to quit my said yeah that and however I have no idea how long I can barely keep up with this ... about a year and a half five and working at about sixty hours a week which is\nA lot for me to the housing you know a husband and family life about what you know what you'd recommend I can do I don't burn out but I you know we're going to ... being exiled from played architect yeah hopefully in the near future\nLet me ask you a couple of quick questions here I'm ... years ease our league contract jobs four to five of them if I understood you quickly you got four to five that you're spending like played all in architecture is that right\nSo one of them down on is a forty hour salary job or the other three are yeah contract project by project alley from here you know long distance\nOkay so the reason I'm asking this is a it it'll it'll color our advice a little bit uh what happens if you're back off do you have to work sixty hours to make a certain number for you all to be comfortable is that what your reality is [noise]\nSo right now he asked my husband will be returning to work and then that beginning of next year we decided to pay that they only had a baby about a year and a half ago and so our financial situation will change at ... kind of gang Uri but right now yeah kind of out of the beast at work or have to\nAnd then just to clarify for Christian I the ideal dream is for you have your own architecture firms that right\nCorrect the only self employed okay you want to know best path to get their crap\nOkay I'm going to say one quick thing to let you go here's the deal hang on until the hubby gets back to ... you know what I mean you got to hang on and you can do it here we are in October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and in Christ is going to were well known about the plan to get their\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or do something you're running independently already or do they go through the main company that's paying your salary\nSo they're different companies okay here yet two of them are kind of actually my own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that you contract court for\nPerfect okay they don't have that yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited to Haiti because you're just going to do more\nAnd lie side you wrote your right cons because here's the deal you are experiencing gross what are you seeing just a moderate projection over the next two years that growth could be\nModerately I think you know we could probably be confident almost saying we could double our uh our sales\nI just okay so here again of course the alternative ... but I'm just saying I Would I Would not do anything until I had a list that said there were double the amount of prose with crazy upside then there are ... and right now\nOn the surface Christie I don't see what the pros would be unless I'm missing something she's going bananas\nHigh arms flailing ... you'll have time to the lady raven\nHere here's a jumped out to me and I hear that's in your voice because I have got entrepreneur in my DNA we get so excited about shiny and new and someone has an opportunity here's my question for you or even if they had never approached you\nWould you want to sell the business\nWere you thinking about selling business is selling the business something you want to do if the opportunity had not presented itself because that's your motivation it's in line with your goals your game plan is that something you're excited if that person never came to you\n[laughter] well that's a difficult question we can all the time I Love what I Do and a half the time I Want to know for my hair\nEntrepreneurial journey that's just a real live [laughter]\nYou know I Am so I\nI I think if the if the situation we're right that then we're absolutely interested um you know I I understand what you're saying it's difficult for someone like me to think about working for somebody else um but that these people you know the bitter interested um\nUh we believe our values the line um you know they talked about keeping us on and the staff
