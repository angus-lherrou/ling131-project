kind of like cancer on the credit card you got to argue with him to get it done but no there's not a way you can mess it up you just need to be persistent is all and make sure that they follow through and change your your check\nAnd if you need to sign a piece of paper forget them to do that that's fine not a big deal don't cancel any life insurance until you have your new life insurance in place always remember that Denise is with us in Washington DC Hi Denise how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've been on a wake up and down probably seven months ago on clean on a really challenging time because we have a childhood in college second year that we need to pay for and that's how I have Harry Carey expect there to age ... expensive that they can hide it and not far\nFrom ... to try to figure out when the\nTime that you have to be fair game pounce on or taking out a scare that while I'm afraid I get something to make sure that we're doing the right to change I don't know when I'm going to be coming back to what it was really pretty devastating to watch that just fine\nI'm Sorry you did that the the the tree last year job and that's scary I don't want to make it worse by going into that\nAnd\nMaking your financial situation worse you know is what we got to do so what a masters or you're in the middle of the storm we get a button down the hatches and so how much is the tuition\n[noise] I'm not going to total we're going to have to pay twenty eighth grade like coming out here we have to pay about a thousand\nOkay and do you have eight thousand way there okay\nWell I mean if you don't really like you can spare the eight thousand in the kid needs to pull out of school or he needs to get a job in Bay is eight thousand but I'm not going to tell you to go into debt and make the situation worse\n\nThan you have the money the only question is you're making a decision do you want the safety net more than you want to pay tuition I'm guessing you're probably going to pay the tuition so how much did you use to make\nAbout five and what does your are you married yes and what does your husband make about Seventy okay and what did you use to do 'em in software support and how long have you been laid off about ... wow\nNot been able to land somewhere worth\nYeah definitely I really like an\nEye on something in that period of time in that field\nThat makes two of us working on it working on it\nOkay 'cause I I ... in other words the good news is you're in a an active\nTechnology type position that ought to be some positions available maybe not Ninety five maybe a hundred and five maybe not a hundred and five maybe Seventy five I don't know but I don't think you're going to be unemployed indefinitely you're not at your inactive market a metro market and you're in an active space so I'm not going to panic\n\nAnd I'm sure not going to make it worse by borrowing money if you're going to panic till junior to come home for a semester\nOr two and get a job that pays eight thousand on that too but um you guys are paying your basic necessities of life out of your husband's income\nAnd that's what you push through but I'm with but you know this eight thousand is another thing and it depends on how much you have in savings to that you got to work with but no I'm not borrowing the money I don't teach people to borrow money to borrow money some urgency don't borrow money when things are good and I'm greedy I don't borrow money when things are bad and I'm afraid\nAnd greed and fear or a good way to lose your butt with money for sure\nSo don't let either one of those be you're driving driving force for Christie is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Christie how are you\nKind Dan thank you for taking my call sure well known in my head and and I are brand new to which I guess now in August fifteenth from northern California and in our new we I had a job in coming here as a para educator and got the school district has been did not\nAnd so our goal at the cash and that we had to have that and and\nThe technocrat enter that got into anyway anyway ... along with ... eternity we now have to pay well we could all learn against it about four years ago and had eight thousand dollars you're meaning\nWhich he retired today are giving him the kind of making a payment and a half to get the seven hundred dollar and the next year to finish paying off a ... dollar he retired from there\nWell he left the company how old only after twenty eight year if if the wind and could they lifted him during higher and\nYou know that doesn't matter on this you know four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days has to be considered do own fault it's Irish regulations\nThat because they want to say that that ... that he can continue to make payments\nOr they don't ... I don't care what they say you need to check with your tax preparer and if you're a tax preparer and found a regulation that aligns with the with what the companies are saying that's fine but I don't think that's so my I don't\nHave anybody that happened I think it's called we call it that far when Kay people\nYou know you need to Mandy call attacks professional not the company that he worked for because my understanding the regulation is four one K. loan if not paid within sixty days of leaving the job is considered an early withdrawal and you are taxed and penalize\nAnd that's my understanding of the real okay so\nHere where I was under the impression was originally and when we left that we weren't going to be able to pay it back that's what we thought drawn based on what they call that we weren't going to take that penalty and or the taxes on it wow and back when we ain't got\nSettled in ... a letter saying that they will say categorized and I are retired I don't care because they don't get to decide what IRS tax regulations are ... and they don't get to make them off and\nSo what they're letter says doesn't matter you need to get some professional tax advice and go to Dave Ramsey dot com click on E.
