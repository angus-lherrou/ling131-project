apprentice job how long ago\nIt's been about six months\nAnd there's written promises that at the completion of The Apprentice apprenticeship that he will have a access to this kind of income\nNo bearing our problem is is\nI never heard of an architectural sales apprenticeship so I'm just is new to me I'm trying to understand why it would do this\nYou know it's not um it's not a new aren't like at a very common thing and that's all right you got to read in the door entered this year and I'm an opportunity that a lot of people don't get 'em and\nWe know the owner likely we totally believe in that that will happen it's just I don't know if you're in the meantime it's like okay\nWe're only working forty hours during the meantime and needs to be working on the job\nGreat\nYou got got bills to pay you can't pay and his wife who's got a baby at home is calling me it's a pretty simple equation and he's more money so how far back what what is his income today is thirty and and what do you how much would another thousand dollars a month change your life\n\nIt would definitely help with feeling more calm and you know like we can make a dent in our debt I didn't know that we're not we're just barely paying\nAre trying to make you feel calm I'm trying to get your where you could mathematically pay the bills mathematically does a thousand dollars a month extra do it\nNow okay what is it like living us out\nNo I'm not trying to move you out you're on an apprenticeship agreed to live in her basement now you're having to put up with her\n[laughter]\nBecause of the territory is what you got signed up for you you know you can't afford to move out while he's on the apprenticeship right that you're talking to her you're stuck there for six more months or as a six more months left in this thing\nI'm\nLike I said we don't really know exactly I Would I Would get a year\nOkay I Want to know exactly on friday by friday\nI Want to know what the guidelines are of

even sure what word they gave me it doesn't work for me I think you guys need a nail this deal down so you know what he signed up for and you know what you've signed up for it so you can see a live beyond the tunnel and you can put a chart on the wall when you get to move out of his mother's basement\nAnd um and then he needs to work and extra job to get the bills paid and I'm going to guess and say you have a big hunk and car payment and he'd sell the car or just a guess but it's a fairly educated guess so I Would add that to the equation as well hope that helps you get a\nOpen phones a

I was really happy with how it\nTurned out it was really really strong honorable stuff so much of it I mean I I've been uh I just was editing a blog up the commercial where Ike a couple of commercials where it goes by the content people on a blog article I'd written them a few weeks ago before I even heard her talk and they have that element of overcoming fear because I think there are so much\nWe talk about transforming around here a lot of transformation transfer forming and getting yourself out of debt transforming your marriage outlets parrot talks about that rage on less with marriage and money or van or a you know Anthony with transforming with your teenagers you ladies in business and\nEvery time there's transformation as a possibility failure as a possibility and fear kicked kicks in\nIt doesn't that voice in your head gets really loud\nAnd it starts even sound rational and you start to make make excuses that really make you make a lot of sense and you stay stuck but if you have someone that can speak into your life whether it's a mentor a friend a spouse that says you can do this and here's how when you lay out the path which we've been talking about that even just today that's what\nA you know ran the solution to so great at getting people to plan whether it's with their money or their business and so on um that\nI loved that quote from the ... late ... said don't listen to your self talk to your show yeah it it started listening to yourself to start telling yourself the way it's going to be but I didn't even know how he describes and he's just so funny what I'm Talking to him\nWhen I listened and some odd years fearing don't worry\nTalk to myself I can tell myself anything I Want to and it that simple as you can tell their self into something\nSo today it's here how did your new project here a little book is cool this way on even given anybody I Know I mean no one knows so this is like big time announcement right now are holding my hand the business boutique\nTwenty Nineteen gold plan or your personal guide to getting results and this thing is chock full with a step by step process to change your life talk about putting this together and what's in the scope planter\nWell when I introduced it to our team a few weeks ago really the best way that I can explain it as there are different things that I use my own personal life to grow and to improve and reach my goals I read books to grow I Will use work books if I'm doing a devotional or Bible study I have to do list and I use a journal to write down goal and the calendar and a calendar\nHow can we pull all these pieces together\nInto a planner that connect those dots so for example in January we set goals and then we talk about what we actually put those on the counter than we put them on the task lists and you begin to see\nHow those goals you set in January really can carry through the entire year and and the way that I built today with like I Would have coaching session so I have questions in there for reflection and activities to work through so if I was sitting down with your coffee these the questions I Would ask you to help you get to where you want to be so it's really fun and then every single month\nHas a different topic in teaching to help you grow and this is kind of like a complement to the business boutique book it's almost like a work but that helps you\nGot perfect for your furniture building business okay right\nI mean that's awesome first of all I Love how you introduce yourself you said I'm a young entrepreneur in right there that mindset\nIs already going to set you up for success you already see yourself in his face that just screams confidence and I love that I Will tell you one of the great things a million I see a lot is you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on this this is something that you could have a side business\nAnd start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills\nBut then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be your full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he started a little T shirt business Dave in college little T shirt business that was a multi million dollar business before he ever graduated and that was his full time thing so I mean you can do this I just want to encourage him\nThe idea that it's difficult to get in this space because you're a girl I think\nIs more in your head than in reality if you build great pieces people want to buy them if you solve problems for people if you had a great product and you take care of the marketplace they don't really care if it was you or do some old someone young they just love the furniture I Am\nI'm an older doesn't buy furniture but my wife would do a decorator and how can just tell you ... either my wife or I were we buy a piece of custom made furniture made by a lady that would actually be a brand that advantage 'cause we would think that was pretty cool\nYeah that you had that you have a good eye for it that there's yeah I think a million that you did does it have to be a barrier for you if you want to get an advantage is just you just get started because you're going to get the most confidence when you saw that first piece even if it's small piece even if you sell it to your aunt I don't care\nJust to get started dip your toe in the water and then it will make sure that Kelly since my book and you can follow that plan it's a step by step plan to grow this business\nAnd start small start on the sly side and you'll see your confidence growing up promised you a ... that will be a non issue it won't even be a fear in your head anymore because like David said you'll start to see it as an advantage that you offer the marketplace through your business that excited for you the fact that you're even asking this question and making that phone call girl you got big things ahead for you I'm so excited for you\nSo let me tell you what happened to me a million when I went broke and I wrote a book about how to handle money I'm a broke\nA show on a book about money that's kind of a disadvantage and all\nOf us who would want to read a money book from a guy that went broke that's what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million bucks a kind of figured out everybody wants to buy a money book from a guy who went broken learned his lesson\nAnd so it actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity that felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brain differentiate her because I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirt you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch\nOn the furniture um and you're going to put a different kind of look a different kind of feel to it\nAnd uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture it's really cool you know it makes you stand out I just love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures with you with your power tools and yet you don't get in there with the big shower or whatever\nAnd safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... opposite of a disadvantage but when I started\nMy in security\nI thought was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right\nIt's interesting to we just had on her leadership master series last week and I was on a panel with Suzanne Suzanne didn't secrets than in ... in a very common theme we heard a in the audience asking questions is\nHow the women women leaders women leaders you know how do I succeed as a woman in a man's industry\nAnd there are certainly some industries where you need to be aware of what you're going into but the reality is so often\nIs bigger in our head than it is in reality it's to your point if the thing we think is holding us back when that's the thing that's going to set us apart and make people want to buy from us and so I I Love the whole perspective Amelia uh that that you already see yourself as an entrepreneur now you just need to see yourself as a successful business owner and start to take those steps\nWell I mean I think about somebody like um you know we're Condi Rice ... and I got to spend time with her obviously female obviously African American obviously super brilliant oh you get smarter to ... oh yeah with a woman so unbelievably smart [noise] but um I mean\n... successful I mean ... state right the United states of America\nI mean you know this is no small job here yeah ... and but what ended up happening with her what what we we were asking her about the same thing the barriers you know the racial barrier the sexism racism all this kind of stuff and she used the line from her neighborhood\nShe should growing up in a segregated neighborhoods in Birmingham, Alabama that her mom I told her it doesn't matter where you're coming from areas where you're going Mm that's good ... and she said I don't let other people with their prejudice decide\nMy fate yep I decide my ... and it was like\nComing out it was just very calm but yeah I heard it loud and clear their confidence in their ... but again it comes back to that that um you know you're going to I'm going to on the space and I'm going to turn what you think is a disadvantage race sex whatever it is you got into an advantage because it's Brenda average raider\nOh I Love how you've been talked about you and share and buying furniture if you look at most American household the women make the purchasing designing decorating decisions\nOr what I think of a a woman that makes plans she's known in the space is at creating furniture and plants and white and I buy her plant like bunk bed plans or a fork in the backyard plans\nAnd I love hers more because she has that female touch now female design so far at least you think she does not only in my mind I got you got you connected we're best friends you know she gets me so a really evil will draw those people based on that she didn't even realize it\nYeah that's that's very very important I think this is a good information the book is business boutique it is a number one buzz shower and you can see why\nChristie ride is with us the founder of that you hear her speak all over America\nAnd teach and you'll see her own media you'll see her at ... dot com and those of you that are members of the uh business boutique academy regularly get coaching from her uh and of course now the crusty right business podcast yes very well right\nIt is it is taken off and it's amazing how when you can encourage people and inspire them and teach them while they're living their lives so like lister is writing on the radio show they may be driving in the car on a commute they may be going for a run or they may be cooking or cleaning or something around the house\nThat you're able to encourage them and give them a the steps and plans and tools that they need to win so it's been really fun to to see the stories coming out of someone that their life has changed from the podcast\nWell the information is important because promotions what changes your life um you don't you don't you know you can listen to music and if you're if for those will be in the car all day I mean if you listen to the same if you listen to him all the time you get the same song\nAbout over what the hour and a half or so now put the thing

to be good to be your income there and she was pretty upset about that so we were considering cashing out my four one K. to say things off and to kind of makers will hold him\nAnd and then what happened at that point is when we got gotten texting that night [noise] um\nI was like you said very upset I started looking into the four one K. option I didn't like that option because we've already in our past of Twenty years cashed in a couple of my small retirements when I quit jobs\nAnd so I called my brother at like eleven o'clock at night he works nights so I can talk to him and I called my brother Charlie and he kind of ripped me is what he did\nDave Ramsey on me they\nSaid that you know we make too much money can be that's broke and he told me that we could you know he started telling

it wasn't really listening very well and hung up like in tears just crying and\nTried to go to sleep but Clinton and ended up getting up out of bed a went into my office got on the computer and started making a spreadsheet and I sat down in the first thing I looked at was the car um it was the only vehicle we other than the tractor that we owe money on still\nMhm um we had my mini van was paid off um had in my power over two hundred thousand miles um wasn't worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happened to own one of the

get to buy back and got the cash settlement got rid of the payment and the position that would put a fan of it actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six\nMonths and so it about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back him what I've been doing and he said he would buy us F EEO\n'em for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind

wealthy check all of this out of course Hogan three sixty dot com or Dave Ramsey dot com Scott's in San Francisco Hi Scott welcome to the ...\nRight that that's what they're going to go sure what's up\nHigh so I've got a question for you so my dad has a small\nGroup working with him for about seven years and I just started a family so I'm trying to take over the kind of make it better on every now and when she comedy either he wants to buy trapped there because you can actually use them\nAnd he said that's the best way that they're not using over taxes rather than\nSaving money we've never been able to hold that have been over twenty five years and you've never been able to have really\nMhm well that's why I'm\nYou know is because you keep spending money on the debt to buy stuff that he don't even need to say on taxes are the the math that he's doing is unbelievably faulty\nOkay let me give me an example what what would be a typical purchased it will be the size of the equipment I'm fifty thousand dollar item a hundred thousand right out ... well yeah but you know if he buys a fifty thousand dollar item um in years past he had to he could not write that all off in one year\nYet a runoff over five years so it was a ten thousand dollar a year right off and he has a ten thousand dollar you're right off you don't get to say it doesn't say ten thousand dollars on your tax\nBill okay mhm\nInstead what it does is it would save you about two thousand dollars on your tax bill now what we're saying officers that he borrowed fifty thousand dollars to save two thousand dollars a year on this tax bill for five years\nYeah the the math is really really faulty there\nAnd so what happens is entrepreneur is either don't think this through and or use this as a rationalization to buy toys inside their business that they really can't afford she goes out to quit buying equipment until you can pay cash for it and then and then you're going to buy older used equipment only equipment you need to do the job\nMhm we don't buy anything here in our office if we don't have to have it to get the job done when anything in the tax write off\nThe way he explained it to me if he has to have because it has to be you know because he said he doesn't want to buy food and not all that break down because it won't be because it breaks down and it out and if that's the way he ex wife and I tell\nThem you're telling me all two year old and three year old tractors aren't safe and break down all the time\nAgain no asinine ... that's just ridiculous OK here's the other thing it's kind of a doctor Phil moment he's worked just bought off all these years and he has no money\nMhm and Dr phil would say how's that working for you yeah it's not you know childhood theory of years working out here it's not working out and and so I don't know how to tell you to tell your dad what to do he's probably not listening to you and he's probably look I mean to me see the point\nNow finally starting to feel like I take it you know I\nAll you're running you know if you're running than if you're running it then you get to make the decision and you and I just decided you can ... I don't want anybody to be unsafe and I don't want to have equipment but I've got\nProbably a million and a half dollars and equipment sitting here within a Fifteen feet of me right now while we're doing the show I Can't have that equipment going down the show would go down that would cost me a lot of money just like that but but we also don't buy equipment we don't need\nAnd then we make a decision whether we are going to buy new and we certainly pay cash for it\nAnd whether it's cameras are computer systems and in your case it's actually heavy equipment we don't own any heavy equipment", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "15"}
