such a big part of the California condor mayhem and you're growing oranges and avocados and and all sorts of other you know strawberries and\nAnd fruits and vegetables you may not know this about me but I Lived in Santa Barbara five years of my life when I was broken I ... I was a porous guy in Santa Barbara at the time but\nUh I Love the weather out there and when I had my first orange picked off a tree which I stole a it was like a I think I've ever had in my life um let me ask you this so you have Thirteen and a half percent state income tax rate out there you are a sanctuary state not a city a whole state\nAnd now they're avenue someone's free health care for everybody is is he putting up a sign that says if you get sick come here will take care of your\nI saw that a Newt has said that all the other governors around the country are probably vote for a new so so they can send anybody who is ill to California\nAnd our tax payers pay a their health care you know that's ridiculous Sean I mean even for months that they didn't want single payer health care but you know new so is basically just\nOffer anything free to anybody and then the process what he's doing is he's going to make California even more on affordable than it already is a\nI the people know that this guy mismanaged San Francisco you didn't fix the homeless problem there he's personally compromised cheese are\nPretty much empty suit he was put in business by a billionaire Getty family and I think people want somebody like myself I I struggled I built a small business I've gotten results in the private sector or and I think that's what people are looking for\nHow come the people of California then maybe I should ask the same question of myself because we're not far behind you in New York state was nine point nine percent high the highest income tax rate\nWhy did the people of California takeoff Thirteen and a half percent income state income tax rate and and there's no rebellion out there why are they taking that crap\nIt's beyond me and a lot of people are leaving Sean as you might know California's had an exodus of people\nTo ask I only yard in Jersey in Illinois when everybody saying in Texas and Florida and in the Carolinas you can come but if you're going to bring your dopey dumb liberal policies with you know stay home [laughter]\nI don't blame them I talk to Greg Abbott about that he said that but they're they're\nThey're ruining the politics of that state although I think they'll still survive lets it we've got to make sure that California is affordable that it's open for business Sean our education system is now vine with Mississippi for one of the worst educational results in the\n... best if you'd be the best you know\nLook I don't know what the I don't know what your odds are I Will say this I I really hope that the people of California pay attention because you know putting a businessman in their California is one of the most beautiful states in the union and it's been literally being destroyed from within by politicians\nAnd I hope the people of California rise up and realize that this was happening to them and the ideas Gavin Newsom of putting out there are so dumb and so it cost prohibitive that it's going to end up being a disaster for everybody and there'll be just the further mass exodus of tax dollars nobody's gonna want to be there so I we live on the\nIf you look around the country a look at

as men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car and eating right I'm going out and we decided to bearing for ... yeah emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we want and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we didn't brand new\nAnd it was the ... were just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we can pay it no problem that we just we didn't want to any more um we one we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future mhm so we just we went ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you get into where in the process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following and podcasts lot of time on the road and I always listen to and it's like they'd we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church ration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start FU in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we ... we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWow well thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's the ... you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but are not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from led me to it because I Believe in modeling all the eight years and now if I can model what I wanted my children have in the future I had to model at my house\nKnow my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids Moore's caught them taught yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know that's what happened but it's happened on this show getting rich\nAnd you're you said you're a college professor for what subject do you teach\nI teach theology and specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would it not\nNo my athletes it can be disability sports but my research specifically for people who have disabilities cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting out off the couch and exercise are being physically active not more toward the competitive fun\nYeah okay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where you worked hand\nA hand in glove with some therapy people into therapy community\nA bird would be ideal for an on going extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer a in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research and your expertise in your information that ought to be very valuable\nUh and that you could build a quote business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing it and move things alone so I I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stops\nWesley with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThank you Dave how're you doing today better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year a completely debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving or like you said a ... you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles free cell thanks for that\nBut I I I live in the ... whatever\nHaving the car payments because I told my buddy as you also this truck will tell me about sixty thousand dollar car and I'm like we need to talk\nAnyway so my question is I'm trying to figure out what to do next because I Want to get rid of the press they don't want to replace it with a truck and I've got a Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home um and my uncle is willing to do all the labor for me for free\nOr to get it fixed up putting you engineer for the training and all kinds of stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck\nA problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable it probably never gonna be Clyde reliable as a moderate our way the law which would would you consider going down the road and you know stop at a couple of thousand into this truck to make it you know\nWhat you know driving around or do you you know save up and wait for a vehicle later on\nI think the trucks a keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think that previous is going to be I hate it too I'm with you [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up\nSixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty vet does rebuild from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... to four but dual for barrels on it it's a beast or not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kinda stuff and move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a ... D move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd let that truck get away and I want to do the project because it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is with us Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\nI'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\n[laughter] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for some advice\nUm my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt and then about two and a half weeks ago great congratulations thank you um\nI work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically it you pay for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to fee pays for that but we have to kind of want that money I had the time um we'd close out all of our credit cards except for the one for the business trips because we don't have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for these expenses\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\nWell I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars cover for the hotel\nOr a guy who was going to get the money back then you get the money back within thirty days\nYeah OK correct so mean we're we're paying the pain that off and and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use it in\nThe ... you need to see that one time you need to ... from the one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and you use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke in pay you back a little company you're taking a big risk sure you're you're the bank or\nFor the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary at some point\nThey may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so that the company that when you go and visit they they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write your company goes broke they're going to take that money from that other company and pay other bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I've been doing this Thirty years I've seen it happen a lot of care so then where does that where does that fit in with\nLeaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk I Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company inside guys I'm Out of that\nI don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nMhm it's only two thousand dollars but I don't ask\nMy people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person is trying to feed their dogs and their kids\nAnd keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and asked them to pay for me to pay back we just\nPay for it would give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card do away with a credit card\nIs that gonna make you how ... going to make your stomach times with us now you're realizing their real\nLives there is this is Dave Ramsey show\nAnd\n\nGuy this is James Giles producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on six hundred radio stations across the country to find one near you tend to Dave Ramsey dot com bust show\n\nSmall business owners you know what usually causes small businesses to fail\nPoor accounting yeah you heard me and not managing your books will often leads to a failure to pay your quarterly income taxes so if you're a small business owner are you ready for your quarterly taxes\nWhat's your household income\nOne thirty year that's good\nOkay and you're for paid for rentals and they have this one okay yeah um how quickly couldn't you pay this one off if you really lean into it like you did before\nI rarely ... any here every three\nOkay yeah I Would think you could yeah\nThat sounds right and then what I Would do is I Would build up cash and I would never buy anything else again so what I Would ask you to to talk about tonight turn off the television and sit down at the kitchen table tonight looked at each other and go okay do we want to sacrifice really deeply out of our lifestyle\nAnd make a hundred and thirty thousand a year we got for paid for rentals but do we want to act like we're broke people\nAnd poor at all on to this rental for two years is this rental worth that to us so we can knock this out really really fast\nAnd then never do it again or\nKind of a no horn and we want to sell it but I don't want to but I don't want to keep it with NO PLAN to pay it off fast\nOkay and then here's the other thing no more Home Depot credit cards no more sign up for dental rentals if the best way to do do it is to live debt free than actually live debt free yeah stop it yeah\nYou got to decide which way you're going to be like you got one foot on the boat one on the dock philosophically yeah so um you know decide because I think you are really doing good until we got to Home Depot and then borrowed money for rental and then you kind of like lost your mind for a minute\n[laughter]\nThat's what it sounds like but now you can clean it up I mean you cleaned up the Home Depot which moved over to this deal now we can clean it up by either selling it or we can lean into it for two years\nAnd have no life and clean this thing up and is this rental wars that we love that rental that much I you know I don't know if you do or not you might I like real estate I might do it but I wouldn't do it again the next time you get ready to buy something at home depot pay cash for the next time you get ... to ... to buy rental you pay cash for it regardless\nOf what you do with this rental but I Would do one of the others that's what I Would do so Hi thanks for calling in some like you guys got a lot going on I mean you're making good money

I mean the one point five included the pay off with a mortgage or the other one right\nYeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that\nWould have reduced the whole thing about the four Seventy in order to reduce\nThe yeah the other ... the cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we heard about a hundred and twenty less than that okay\nAnd that but that that uh\nSix hundred thousand or so is included in the one million paid off shore okay sure so the a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing those right was done with all of these two properties oh yeah oh yeah wow\nYeah on the right of all of the aisle of the extra staff which is a challenge whenever we or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you sit in the summer is being able to get a lake and now and mark got me on board I think\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kind of thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one the four Seventy one interest worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go show radical yeah also and you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like eternity as all the lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time mhm\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and openly\nWasn't that way on one of those ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France ha ha ha or out of Hartford in the beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force anyone would you like when I heard\nIt was really difficult to to give out some things that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that but it also kind of oil down here they are getting older and we have\nI'm Sorry to hear it has a cash value in it right\nDown to three thousand dollars\nOkay and you understand premium offset is they're using the three thousand dollar cash value to pay the premiums are right now that's not offset you're using your savings account instead of your checking account to buy your premium\nTo act like I said it's not all say they're ... they're getting their dad gummed money you can count on that\nThey're taking it ended up getting\nYou know it's hot sorry yes my point he made it sound like it's free\nRight and I went back to the candidate out policy that race or oh\nI Know and when you die you know what happens is the three dollars in dollars they're going to keep it now they\nAre going to keep it so how is this good idea there's no way this is a good idea so you show you do whatever you want to hunting but those policies are crap and I wouldn't keep a thirty seconds and it wouldn't have the big discussion was stupid whole life insurance agent about it either match on the line and Los Angeles I'm Matt how're you\nDoing fabulous ... thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up\nSo um my question revolves twenty five percent rule that you use for the mortgage my wife and my bottom on about a year ago\nAnd I'm I'm One of those people were all I did not include property taxes on modern association and the\nInsurance as part of the home in the bank ideal all of that separate way mhm so my question is is are you supposed to include the H away a property taxes and the insurance as part of your twenty five percent role in the way that you teach\nI generally just say principal interest taxes and insurance away no but most people as you know we're paying that has one payment and the whole point is not whether it's twenty five percent or twenty seven percent or twenty three percent there is no magic number there the point is is trying to keep people from being house you pour\nOkay where they got a dead gum payment they can't breeze and then they wonder why they're broke right\nYeah well we just started here class about six months ago we actually purchased the house about a year ago and and the numbers like we we actually get a thirty year long but it accounts for twenty percent of our income so\nUm we have about forty thousand less than that pay off and then we are looking actually refinanced into a Fifteen year long while but that\nCan ... if you've got a good interest rates you can just pay that loan like it's a Fifteen and it'll pay off in Fifteen\nThat's true we have the option to do that as well\nEither either one is fine I don't know if I go to refinance cost if you have a competitive interest rate but it sounds like you're fine I mean 'cause you're you're twenty percent is in great shape for right now you got to clean up this other than that but I mean the thing I don't want to have somebody with a you know six thousand dollar\nIncome take home pay and in a in a four thousand dollar house payment and wondering why they're broke you know Hitler the whole\nThe whole point is big numbers here not the ... and not splitting hairs on it the er and I'm not saying you're splitting hairs you're being wise to ask for details there's nothing wrong with that but but I I'm saying my formula of twenty five percent is not so perfect\nThat if you're at twenty five point five percent oh God you're going to you've messed up everything no no no the point is just to not be\nHouse ... that's all it is it's kind of a big number philosophy in other words big chunky numbers not find two numbers other things I Do I Do find two numbers on but that's a good clarification thanks for calling in Jackie's in Oklahoma City Hi Jackie how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up okay\nI'll just start off for like ... I Am twenty seven years old I had a a a total of twenty five hundred that are twenty five thousand a day or that including my mortgage and\nAccess that and my question is would it be worth it to save an add on to my house for to save and buy and so at least save up for the down or if it would be more ideal pet save\nDiscontinued ... every single stat and then by our dream house later on\nOkay I'm a little bit confused ... you yeah I Know ... it's okay you're wanting to add on to this house or move up in house\nNo add on to this house I live in a gray area I work from home is why I Need a physical neither based in one day when I had a house that you're living in worth um\nRight now it's probably worth about Seventy thousand I bought it for forty\nOkay and if it's worth Seventy nine", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "12"}
