brains out yes and I'm three eighty was had to be med school to\nAbout two hundred and sixty of it was in student loans and about one when he was on a mortgage your house and everything yeah wow how are you thirty one how long you been out of school ah about three years okay\nSo you come out of med school and\nA ... a year or so it goes by but then right after that you decide to attract the stuff with a vengeance tell me the story my goodness\nYeah well I finished it was actually residency three years ago\nAnd when I came out I started going to a church that was doing financial peace university and some of my friends were taking it and talking about it and saying great things and so I decided to download your audio book total money make over ... I started listening to it and I think that turning point for me was when I got to the point about the debt snowball and lifting your debt\nBecause up until that point I had been just doing everything they tried to avoid thinking about it it was stressful I just I didn't even want to it you know deal with it and I logged on and I saw that in the past three years I had been pain about Thirteen thousand dollars a year\nAnd about Fifteen thousand dollars a year it was occurring in interest every year\nSo I really wasn't even making a dent in the student loans and so I knew something needed to change I Need to get serious especially being\nIn my late twenties at the time and single I didn't want to have this garden looming over my head for the next decade or two and certainly if I got married and had a family in the future I didn't want to bring that burden into that\nWhere you're paying off a ridiculous amount of debt with a ridiculously wonderful income show you hum wow okay so you you finished residency\nAnd really about a year went by before you started this right yeah roughly year okay did you come straight out and go into ER yeah yeah Microsoft with emergency medicine so you were making bucks already mhm but then you just when you shut down to the math on this you went oh I can do this\nYeah I just realized that something absolutely needed a change because I just I couldn't live like that anymore\nWow look at you and just didn't mean you just do them now do you take a lot of extra time at a yard to in order to get the income and this was one of the ... you know our position makes\nSo I actually went to my boss and asked if I could work all night shift any ER and I did that for the entire twenties too much pointing months because it paid significantly more to work nights you know is it it's just that Governor double with it uh it's about twenty percent more an hour to twenty percent more okay All right\nBut wow so you really sacrifice to get this done the people think you were losing your mind I mean your family your doctor\nReally enjoy your life I mean yeah the one thing I heard a lot of was in regards to mind and\nUh it'd be okay to have an electric bill\nOkay All right and how does your wife work outside the home yes you go\nOkay she'll between her income and your military retirement the households not going to fold up\nNo not at all about it through the ... year\nYeah and that's if you don't work yeah so why do you need to save money\nAll ... a ... ... and living a little a little more money now we're trying to get our budget and everything under control and\nI just want to make sure that what I Do I understand it as I get my budget under Seventy five thousand between now and then and I would get my career lined up between now and then you got plenty of time brought here that yeah I just I don't I don't want I mean you can't save up enough to not deal with those two issues agreed\nOh yes 'cause you'll burn through whatever it is if you never go back to work and you always spend more than the Seventy five\nNo matter how much you're safe object a hundred grand you burn through it eventually you know so we we we have to we have to go ahead and address those issues so let's just address from now\nBut again thank you for your service we appreciate it and so yeah I get my career lined up and I get my budget lined up under Seventy five thousand and that takes the pressure off of getting the career\nWound up exactly but a ... year even your your okay it's not your good long term plan but no I I think I'd go ahead and work on getting my debts paid off now and build your emergency fund whatever you got to do but let's keep working your debt snowball keep working your baby steps\nGet their career lined up that's what I Would do\nRyan is in Atlanta Hi Ryan how're you\nDoing good how are you doing Dave better than I deserve what's up\nTrying to question [noise]\nInvesting so I guess the short overview um I'm thirty and my wife's thirty three\nA combined income right now about one Seventy five ... I'm only that is more games I'm a car payment and then I'm a little bit of student loan that we've got the cash to pay it off a which was a about a go at the end it off the U.S pay\n'em even after that we can get at least six months of\nUm you know emergency expenses that back emergency on um I've got a four one K. and a pension she has four one K. and profit sharing and my main question is what a an extra income every month\nAnd if we should be so good at something that's strictly tied to retirement which it seemed like we have a lot of or is it would be better to put that into something more accessible like a like a managed a like a some type of managed fund that can be accessed\nPrior to retirement if need be\nYou know we call those bridge funds um yeah at some point I Would go there but I think you've got some cleaning up to do y'all been pretty sloppy you make a lot of money to be as broke as you are um how long have you been making that kinda money\nOn the last couple of years okay\nIt's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess then yeah let's ride from checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them\nDo yeah\nGood let's do that today and then you need to have your emergency fund up three to six months of expenses not income three to six months of expenses and uh that's what we call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for solid financial plan your debt free and you have your rainy day fund\nExcept your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps for five and six do you have children no not right now okay\nThen a wee weed baby steps for is Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's not much with what you guys make\nBut it's a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring and doing the bridge stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm going to do it in the right order um [noise]\nOnce you're doing that then maybe step five is kids colleges that does not apply here baby steps six pay off your house early Emory children knocked a house out beyond that which is has the same effect\nTo your net worth that the bridge loan does because having your home paid off frees you up an enabler due to need a lot less income\nTo retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which really do how much do you own your home\nAll the good old two eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're forty your house is going to be paid off\nAnd by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your debt one hundred percent debt free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nI have a single parent in the world mathematically with one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing his or bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between age fifty two and you\nKnow if you wanted to have enough to ... to do some stuff with before that but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth as a result of having no payments\nTo go with income or your most powerful wealth building tool is your income we've just finished a study here that Chris Hogan is doing a book on a ... of the largest study of millionaires ever done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of ten point two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invested in there for one k.'s and once they maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds or by some real estate that you pay cash for its income producing or something like that where you've got some other money that you've got access to\nThat is not retired not all tied up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back on the line as to the front of the line on when you're going to get to it\nUm and you'll get there faster if you'll do it the way I'm Talking about in the way you're talking about in clean up this mass you make too much money we shouldn't really stupid car payment it's ridiculous man thanks for the call\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five couldn't tell is following me on YouTube dot com\nPlus they Ramsey bowl or you can watch the show live on YouTube and you can see all the debt free screams on there and you can see all the ranch on there\nSome really good stories about people having turned their lives around

forty thousand got student loans Bob in credit card after the father medical bills wrote don't know where to begin\nWell one time and we tell folks are two ... two largest hospital you know pay minimum payments on everything but the little one on a pack a little while and when it's going to pay much further it any other money you can squeeze out of your life and your budget and\nThrow up actually every time you want\nYour money to ... to Mars why\nThanks for the golf course was that I [noise]\nWe have\nAnd why [noise]\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nBut actually managed to make something that was already difficult to understand even more confusing\nIt's never been more vital to your business should consult with attracts professional to determine how the new tax law will affect your business employees and quarterly filings I'm Talking about consulting with a tax endorsed local provider here are some of the changes that affect your spending now\nBecause you know you can again you can do this for a year you could lose for two or three years but you cannot do it over the scope of ten to Twenty years and prosper\nBecause you're you're ... poor at that point your your your house was draining the blood out of your life\nAnd you you just don't have anything left here you have no margin you have no wiggle room and a show you guys have got to sit down and analyzes or something we can do to get our incomes up substantially or we've got to look at living further out\nIn in a different setting where it's not as expensive I Know California real estate's expensive I understand I'm In ... in and out of California in and out of Manhattan all the time I understand these markets I Know the markets but I mean it's almost impossible to live on the island of Manhattan unless you're making a hundred dollars a year\nUm you just cannot afford the rent even on a studio apartment and so that's what you're facing in your market there uh and then the ... you know we're talking about this in San Fran the other day when I was over there you you cannot afford to live in Silicon valley\nUnless you make substantial money and so I mean so this and Silicon Valley as a result is having a real problem staffing service type jobs\nBecause nobody the service type jobs for typical service type income can afford to live there and so you run into all kinds of people are being busted him to do\nLabor type jobs and a ... you know because we can't afford to live in Silicon valley and and that's that's just a mathematical facts of the situation so that applies to you and you've got to make some decisions are is are we going to do something with our careers that allow us to live in this house or\nAre we going to do our in order to stay in that job and and the general area we're probably looking at a more substantial commute Amy is with us in Detroit Michigan Hi Amy how are you\nCan how are you David thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nWhat's up well I Am not a living ... to ... to the lender I had a relief I Am trapped and ... um the car with three toed

thanks for having always fun to be with you the smart conference in\nKansas City last weekend phenomenal you did a great job presenting that really connect\nDidn't think it yes it uh it it was exciting to see people jot down some of the things we were talking about that practically allow them to get where they want to be you know that I mean we can all envision a mountain top\nBut then it gets real scary when we started thinking about how do I scale that mountain top and as we talked a lot about the proximity principal and gave people some ideas on the right people they need to be around and and the right places that need to be in\nBecause if you want to do something to be in the proximity of that thing\nIt's it is here to the proximity principles simply says in order to do what I Want to do you fill in the ... like\nThat I've got to be around people who are doing that and in places where that is happening so think about that when I'm Around the right people they help point mean to the to the right places and then when I go in those places and were specifically looking for three things in the right places where I can learn where I can do and where I can connect\nAnd date when I'm In the right places I inevitably going to be more of the right people and so it becomes this cyclical process that is so profoundly simple\nIt should demystify the path to getting where I Want to go you're an example it here's what's great about this no matter how successful you get your always practicing the proximity principle you're continuously looking to get around the right people whether it be for personal reasons are professional reasons you like to sit down billionaires want to learn things about these men and women\nYou know and you're constantly thinking about what are the places I Need to be an awareness Ramsey solutions need to be this is a very simple principle that no matter where you're at life if you want to get somewhere you have to practice proximity\nYou know I've noticed that happening here in our little bird outside of Nashville Franklin, Tennessee has has ended up becoming a melting pot for people who write\n... in the self improvement Space Center ... who ah who speak and the self improvement space\nI mean I've been here all along a Mike Hi it on a ... has been in the ... a friend of mine down the road Donald Miller moved here in the last couple of beers or in from ... from the ... moved here about the time that book take took off there's probably a handful of others that I'm just not even thinking you're mentioning right now\nUm but a ... a lot of movement and it just seems to be this thing happening\nAnd it's almost like an artist community like Asheville North Carolina very much an art community now and you get around the things and the people\nAnd the places that something's happening and then you have a better chance of pulling it off that's right and it's not that the Donald Miller or director Mike Hi interact are already in every day we certainly don't but we all know each other and we all interactive and we've all helped each other that's one way or another ah sometimes it's just a drop by nothing real fancy\nBut it is a very much all within about five miles of each other you know as an example\nYeah it it it here's what happens when you get around like minded people\nThen there is a natural\nA force if you will it's almost magnetic\nThat they are going to pull you into their or of a little bit just by their example and you you know there there's a guy that you and I both admire I never had the chance to meet him Charles tremendous Jones you know as a famous saying that said you know who you are five years from now is largely\nDependent on the books you read and the people you meet and we've also heard the age old colloquial isn't that nobody can attribute it to anybody but it's not\nWhat you know it's who you know who you know so again what we've done here on the show with with helping people try to\nDemystify or take away the fear of getting where they want to go is by showing them this is a process is not going to happen overnight\nIt might take you four years of putting yourself in proximity to the right person\nFor me to have you know my story you watched it from afar eight years\nEight years of small itty bitty baby steps\nAre of putting myself around the right people and in the right places doing the hard work learning being humble hustling stain hungry and then you get an opportunity at some point everybody's story is different but as I said Saturday Kansas City in the crowd kind of laughed at this\nSo I'm I'm Out of that and I I'm saved up my mind and the fun I have children three and five and I'm just wondering if I Would have to go through all the training to becoming a pilot\nBecause I feel like if they're calling for me but I'm not positive and I'm just wondering if I said\nTap into that world or if I sit down and continue doing what I'm doing and saving and then retire I mean that's pretty much where I'm at right now and I don't know\nI don't know what to do I get kind of stuck\nWell what would be wrong with becoming a pilot\nUm well I research they hurt the knowledge that\nMhm and what are you right now I'm I make fifty five\nPounds to make a lot more than that show you issue if you spent eighty and you made twice as much as you make now that'd be a good return on investment so that's not um ... what's the rest of the problem\nUm I guess how away from the family\nOh now that's real ... but let's look at that do you have you done the research what is that going to based on the cost and you're going to do it cash so that's another issue you're going to do this cash so it's going to take a little bit while hide but are you willing to do what it takes to be in the air and fly\nI think I have to\nPut my foot forward and at least attempt to try and the work out that mean that you get your pilot light Obama's grant so let's see if I felt like it was there for me I Would probably say yeah\nSo I see the answer is unequivocally yes I don't think it's probably yes I think your heart is so clear everybody on the air can here here's what I'm telling you know you don't need to feel any guilt here's why\nYou've done the Dave Ramsey plan you're doing the play and you're going to continue to work in that job that's making you fifty five thousand you're going to castle as you go\nAnd because this is going to take maybe five seven years I'm making that up whatever it is you're going to do and as you go and that means you're not going to sacrifice that much time away from the kids number one number two you're not going to starve because you're going to stay in that day job while you're pursuing the dream job\nAnd by the time you get ready to be gone from being a pilot the kids are going to be a lot older\nAnd the kids are going to see that mom set our mind to something and pursued it the right way and is happy and fulfilled what a tremendous life lesson in example you're going to be I don't see why you should have any guilt at all in fact I think you should be fired up about it and take one small step today\nWe might even guilt you if you didn't do [laughter]\nExactly you know I really appreciate it\nThanks for the call now reality is where she gonna be a corporate pilot today she might be going a lot that's that's where I'm little kids' books\nAnd that might not be our lifestyle the fish but this is a process for it's not it's not a snapshot these are not instantaneous that's where I can just push a button and decide your pilot no this is going to take some kind of doing that but let's let's let's play this out real quick folks you heard this if it takes her day five to seven years to ... between the eighty thousand cash flow\nPlus the the classes and all the training that requires to become a pilot\nShe could still stay in that day job begin to do things on the side maybe she fly some tours on the weekends again the kids are still maybe early teens but just five years removed from that they're out of the house and then she can go full time but she can actually fly part time\nI mean we have to look at the big picture and this lady wants to be in the skies and she can do it\nNow I got to tell you the problem with that thing is it's addicting from what I hear all star 'cause I Know I mean I'll give you a vast car so I Know you can't imagine how bad are get sucked into that that would be a bad idea ... you know I don't yeah I can tell some things I don't need to start because I don't have to finish them\nLook it's a bird no it's ... it's a pretty scary out there in so many ways barbers on Instagram can she says I have over Twenty years of experience or should I have a two page resume with all my jobs listed instead of the suggested one page\nNo which is why suggested one page but let me explain why [laughter] I Love those costs you know we fought this thing through
