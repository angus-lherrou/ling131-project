life sometimes I go down but most of the time they go up and if they go down I'm not going to panic and they'll come back up\nAnd that is looking at the track record you might not have had the actual numbers memorized but good walking around sense means you observe real excite goes up in value over time right right and so that's what I needed about mutual funds were some good walking around Sam so one of the very first ones I ever bought\nWas Seventy five year old mutual fund and um\nIt's got an average annual return over Seventy five years at a little over eleven percent\nNow that's average some years it went down\nSome years it went up but for me that was kind of like buying a house on the street with big trees\nI felt like I'm a pretty stable neighborhood oh and out of the last ten years it had only been in when I bought it back then I mean it only lost money to two out of ten times all the other years have made money and over the scope of ten years that made money\nSo it was a pretty calm growth in income ... mutual fund and when I was looking at was the track record and going okay\nI Know there's risk in the stock market and I know stupid people lose all their money in the stock market 'cause they buy some little stupid company and the company goes under and they lose all their money because they're just playing with a golfing buddy told him to do but I'm looking at a mutual fund here that's invested in Ninety two hundred different stocks\nIt has a Seventy year track record as a you know tenured drag are you in twenty year drag record and I can actually look at it and go okay what's it averaged over the last ten years what's your average over the last Twenty years and how many times has actually been down\nNow is that a guarantee that it won't go down in the future it's not a guarantee but your house wasn't either and if your house did go down one time out of ten years or one time to three times out of Twenty years you wouldn't panic you'd all around the house and you know let it come back up and that's how I first got\nComfortable with mutual funds 'cause you know ... in my late twenties I went broke and lost everything I don't like losing money I don't like risk but I also don't like money invested are sitting in an account making one percent when it could be making ten or twelve\nAnd ... and so if I got a mutual fund that's average eleven percent four Seventy\nFive years and it only does half of what it used to do well\nThat still five and a half percent half I mean it's like really suck it's going to do half of what it's done for Seventy five years that's got to be really bad I mean it's like\nThe worst possible ... period of time you know so uh I'm a beat my savings account I'm a beach or annuity I'm a beat everything if\nIt does and that gave me a lot of comfort and and you know and again\nOn but but the reason you're laying awake at night is you didn't think about it in terms of track record and knowledge\nOf history will give you peace on investments it'll allow you to sleep well in in so just take your time and learn take your time and wondering if you need some help sit down with one of our smart vest or pros we will not endorse people and they're not people who work for us but we don't endorse the smart Mr pros unless they have the heart of a teacher\nBecause we don't want you to invest money in white and I I don't want you to that I think that's what that means you didn't understand what you invest in them or you did understand and you put it in some stupid you shouldn't be lying awake at night with your investments just like you shouldn't be lying awake when he bought the house in Texas you bought your home ... awake at night I was with that and so\nIf you go on the website of Dave Ramsey dot com clicks smart faster I'm putting your information it'll drop down a list a smart rest her prose in your area Saddam pocket when I'm there is no obligation just learn the more knowledge you have about something\nThe more calm you are about it\nIt's a simple or something like driving a car\nThe very first time I got behind the wheel of a car I think that's probably about ten years old ... told me I could move the car down the driveway and um the gravel driveway and I think I emptied all of the gravel out of the driveway because I think I just stepped on the accelerator floor border to end just dug a hole with the ...\nAnd the first time ever drive a car you remember how nervous your weather is in a field or in a parking lot and then the first time you drive on on the road you remember how nervous you are and and then but you know what\nHe's doing anything about it now you're in your brain auto pilots cigar in or what happens is you have learned to do something that has risk because you can record car there's no guarantee it has risk what you've learned to do it\nAnd the knowledge and the practice has given you a piece and you do it without your heart rate even change if you don't lay awake at night on a cashier I drive a car to more\nInto it doesn't bother you even though you're taking risk but it's practice and knowledge in practice and knowledge\nOpens owns a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money Justin is on Twitter following me at Dave Ramsey about eight hundred and something thousand of you do that my son's having a hard time finding an apartment due to ... due to having no credit any advice\nAdequate looking at the super expensive apart much he's going into these corporate managed things where they've got a twenty eight year old managing the apartment or the twenty four year old managing the apartment and they're not allowed to think if you have no credit that means you have no debt\nIf you have no debt you know what that means you have money and so you're more able to pay rent as a landlord I Love people that have no credit\nIt's awesome assuming they have an income that means they have a lot of money to pay my rent ...\nAnd so you just got to find somebody that again is actually allowed to use their brain in the renting of the apartment there's plenty of those out there but some of the large corporate things they they don't allow them to think and if you don't have a credit score we can rent to you and what that means is I'm worth tens of millions of dollars and I can't rent an apartment there\nI could write a check and Bob the complex but I Can't rent an apartment there and that's how stupid that scenario is\nThat means the people running that place you're stupid exactly

counties down let's say you're a debt free scream\nThree why why\n\nThe Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been I've reported on the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today I've been horseback all terrain vehicle helicopters boats I'd been there I've seen up I was up close and personal when it turned out gang members were being arrested I've got the video of it\nDrug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand the people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying our laws\nThat we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America is to respect the laws of this land\nAnd respect America sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that\nAnd doing the right way and they should have precedence over those that are lawless and don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple and you know I felt listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars we've spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can't take care of themselves they will be taking care of you\nKnow America's never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm but it is it we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have the ability to do that\nAnyway eight hundred nine four one showing you want to be a part of the program Donna's in Iowa Don Hi how are you glad

speak out about protecting our borders you know if we had the wall built do understand we\nWouldn't have to worry if they ever got to the border that there would be some type of confrontation 'cause he couldn't take could dampen it would be good for people on both sides\nIt'll encourage people to follow our laws of respect our country and our borders and our sovereignty and at that point people go through the process legally and I'm not saying that we don't let people in from other countries I don't really care where you come from you know you got to show you were able to take care of yourself\nThat you believe in our values and you want to contribute and you're not a threat to your neighbor that's it it's pretty simple and if you want to come to America I don't blame you we can't

really stupid okay but if you had ten of those and had a hundred thousand bucks lined up because you got some gimmick stuff that's better than having no insurance\nOkay but again you're always measuring than back against that what it's costing you ... dollars a year for ten thousand dollars worth of insurance no\nRight now but what I pay a hundred bucks for that policy in this situation maybe\nThat is really high for a forty year old per thousand you see what I'm saying so you know it's just a matter of relative cost to the amount of coverage and and just does it give you sticker shock when you look at it the last thing of course is if you remain uninsured the long term your goal would be the same\nAs it would be for those who have insurance and that is by getting out of bed and building wealth you need for insurance goes way\nOkay\nBecause if you have a million dollars in your four one K. and you have no debt house or anything and you die your wife can probably make it\nOkay ... that's called self insured in other words\nOkay with the increase maybe the amount of the emerging he found at all if I'm remain in trouble\nProbably yeah yeah a\n... you know just because again she's going to be facing something and that would be part of your self insured wealth building picture that we're trying to go for a long term and we go for that either way I mean the goal is raise the kids get them out of the house so they're not there to have to be fed right\nA goal is to get the house paid off and everything else paid off and then build a huge mistake if you've done those three things you know somewhere in your fifties or sixties you becomes completely self insured maybe sooner because your wife would be okay if you left or behind with a huge pile of money no debt the kids are going to make sense\nAnd so we work towards that that's why we suggest term insurance sister the one of the reasons we should just term insurance because term returns as you were finding out runs out so it's a couple of three suggestions there but I'll tell you this I think within five years you're in trouble\nOkay if you stay clear to diabetes if the if the diagnosis doesn't recur\nSo um but designer can tell you more or it used to be that if you had diabetes or cancer or heart you were just done no no no amount of time but the insurance market has gotten much more sophisticated in analyzing your actual situation case by case and those three things do not\nPermanently mean no life insurance ever\nNow again you know cancer diagnosis two weeks ago you're not in trouble you know but if you've been clear of cancer free for five years and somebody told you never get insurance you might be able to get insurance\nAnd start to look at that and you were rated but it won't be you won't get premium prices but you check on that folks you check on that no calls and talk to him no dog either it Susan is with us in or wherever I don't push the wrong button surgeons

about fifty eight and um he plans to retire a fix it came I Will probably retire earlier than that uh we're in pretty good shape how we don't have any that we have a four O. one K. and I have a retirement well\nGood how much is enough for one guy um [noise]\nLet's say mine is about Seventy five and his he actually has about forty and for like when Kay but then we have that separate account with a\nA financial adviser that I'm probably two hundred thousand\nOkay and what your housework um to about two hundred and it's paid for yes now so you're probably millionaires or to go\nUm well yeah I think but I don't like about it [laughter] it's okay um I have a little bit of fear about a couple of things okay I'm mainly you know when we retire or he won't have the insurance policy and

crew\nVery cool good for you guys welcome very good so tell me the story what happened thirty nine months ago they put you on this journey well\nNot forty years ago we were getting ready to get married yeah eight and that so we had a financial talk and we realize that we thought had about the same amount of\nAnd going into a marriage and so we and we knew that that would limit our options and in life you know whether we wanted to move somewhere or you know such jobs things like that and so we knew we wanted to be that free but we didn't know how and that was all we knew at that point and\nAnd leave at that without you know that that's really normal and it's just part of being an adult [laughter] so we didn't know it was possible yeah and uh\nA few months later we and we got married and we had a few people mention Dave Ramsey and financial these University in passing and we can really put a lot of weight on every like okay that's coal and assistance sounds complicated no thanks [laughter] and and then I was out at lunch out with my friend Tasha and I\nShe had her wallet with her and I made fun of her and I was like your weight is huge but do you have in here and she said oh you know my envelopes are in there and so I finally had to ask like okay fine explain what this envelope deal is to me because I've been hearing it I don't know what it's about\nAnd so she told me about your past and I listened on my way home and I you know just kept listening and I finally talked about it and I said you know\nThere's I either just stay Ramsey guys than mentioned to me a few times and it looks like he has\nA financial plan and part of that is getting out of debt and maybe that's just something that we need to look into mhm and that was about a month after we got married and a month after that we started our first budget mhm\nHadn't been through ... and so I didn't know he was supposed to participate in the eye and try to how I did a budget on my own and I presented it to him and I said you know if you're willing to do that and he wise and and I was like if you're willing to this I Need you to find the site\nThat made me stop you already did it they may\nHave signed a contract yeah yeah she knew you know I I was cautiously optimistic yeah um because\nAgain I had kind of lost that hope of I Would ever be out of debt I remember going up thinking praying like man it'd be nice to just be a zero again you know starting a zero\nBut she made me sign it and I was like are just going to be like a a diet fat you know the next fat for a diet you get on it for two or three weeks and next thing and you know you get back to eat and um so\nShe made me sign it and you know I stuck to it you know if I put my name or something yeah I Do have a big deal that's that's my name that's my word is my bond you know she made me sign it\nAnd she knew that I was very good I like that yeah wow it was fun yeah and so there's ... there's zero base budget was born at your house ship well and it's game on him\nOn a few months later we take ... year actually coordinator here in the first while you're and we've done in about five times sense why all\nYeah thank you how neat course they've and I I just take a few moments you know to the to the listeners and those are you watching it on YouTube coordinate in a few\nClash you don't have to have the answers Dave and his team on the video have the answers you know it's nine classes over nine weeks just take two hours a week that's Eighteen hours you know instead of binge watching TV and keeping up with the ... how about you charge people out of stock you know with the Joneses so\nThere were no sign you are at the moment that doing it infomercial regularly scheduled programing [laughter]\nOh thank you very much\nAll right well I think the answer the question 'cause I was put in about\n... percent and I was thinking you know would be on your way and that doesn't sound like they're from ... so\nYeah and it's very just a temporary thing it's not that I don't like you investing in their four one K. when you get to be here for you easily with no payments in the world except the house payment can put Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement but in that the problem is you're delaying how long you get there and here's what happens\nThe things that we focus on in our life\nAre the things we're good at are you married\n[noise] no I'm Single I Am twenty nine years old\nOkay are you dating [laughter] yeah I'm Serious relationship\nYeah I've been married for three years in actually trying to make that next step you know it can go next year or so\nOkay so have you noticed that while you're in this stage of you're dating how focused you are on her\n[laughter] you know what you focus on you're good at have you noticed that [laughter] that is true yeah and and so you know it is ... and it's a behavior thing it's a psychological thing it's a spiritual thing it's an emotional thing\nAnd that is is that ... and so it's more that's more of the reason to stop the investing than the math\nTen percent that you're putting in is not going to cause you to get out of debt that much faster but what does he is when you're like all in\nA mall and like you are with her you're all in ... you're all in okay you're focused you're concentrating\nAnd and that's that's what we want you to do with the debt here for a short period of time I want you to be all and I'm not doing anything I have no life I'm focused on working extra I'm selling stuff I'm not doing anything ... beans and rice rice and beans I'm getting out of [noise]\nOkay that's the way that you out of that that that's what gets people out of that more than the mathematical manipulation so that's what's important\nAbout temporarily stopping you're investing when you're in baby step too and that's why we suggest that hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll send you a copy of the book the total money make over and it'll help explain that a little bit further for you than a is with us in a City Iowa how do they how are you\nHiding out in a huge fan I think I use your name and talking to people that my name's I Swear to [laughter] oh I'm Sorry how can I help I'm about my um my youngest brother he's Twenty years old I'm four years ago he\nLead from behind a highway speeds ... my parents are going into litigation far what his future will be like um kids in a job training program kind of just learning basic skills like how much and you know big groceries things like that\nSo many Americans got a brain in an area that's yeah I hear that a brain\nInjury a lot of memory as you can um impulsivity and so I'm not really sure how to you know my dad I Do some research and I was like well I don't call Dave and she like he would say about um the legal stuff as far as hot as secure as a future for Daniel that he'll be taking care of\n... I'm Sorry what a sad situation I assume they have an attorney right they do yeah mhm and they've assessed the ability to ah that that the person they hit them had insurance and or assets that make it worth chasing them around right\n[noise] yeah it's been a long process over four years just kind of seen what would happen with Daniel or this time frame that you know that the effects of this accident song\nWell there's a I mean there there's not a magic thing but a a a good attorney in this situation should be able to help you run the numbers out that basically has a you know the the accident has taken away his earning ability\nFor the next sixty years mhm that's a very expensive thing that he is lost that they need to pay him for\nMillions and millions of dollars mhm is what he would have learned in his working lifetime is now gone\nYeah and so to offset that due to the accident is the liability of the person that caused the accident\nAnd you don't have to be an attorney to know that okay so the calculation of that I'm ... and ... you know could we get a big enough lump sum that it that a lump sum invested causes\nA you know Daniels income to never be a problem again mhm and so if you take a million dollars and invest it and then you know as an eighty thousand two hundred thousand dollar income the rest of his life\nAs an example you see what I'm saying and um and that's probably not enough but I mean that's that's the that's an example of a calculation to offset what he would have potentially earned in his working lifetime because that was stolen from him\nBecause of this accident and uh I'm not being angry towards the person who did I have no idea the conditions of the accident but that's just the liability that that person and their insurance company has as ... as a result of law okay and your attorney Modi told you all of that that's a basic thing\nIt's like business law one on one okay the very first movie learns I kind of stuff so um\nYou know once you do that than you are saying we're we're replacing his lost income and certainly then medical bills in addition to that\nAnd uh and medical bills would include any kind of job training we can do to help him have a quality life skill or you know anything we do increases quality of life going forward right\nMhm but there's not a magic number to figure this out it's just a ... there's a calculation you can do to estimate these things and you know all of those things added to gather makes the\nUh you know the the settlement negotiation with the insurance company go on now they may be in there probably is um limits\nTo the insurance coverage and there are limits not to liability but to the assets that the person has let's say this person had basically no money and the insurance companies on the hook for half million dollars you can negotiate the rest of your life and you're not getting more and a half million dollars 'cause guys broke and you can't get blood out of Iraq\nOkay and so you sue him into oblivion and they won't do any good suing people to make them have money it just takes money they do have\nIf you win and I'm obviously you'd wind here\nBut um but it'd take a long time so the settlement may be that the insurance that is the person carried maxed out and it ... out of their life at their assets\nNow if that person is worth two million dollars and the insurance company has a million dollars then your maximum you're going to get out of this three million dollars take everything the person had if you wanted to do that\nAnd get the million dollars other insurance company to Megan from that person they solve everything they've got and give it to you\nOr or give it to Daniel in this case and so that that's how the calculation works but what most folks don't realize because this is so emotional so tragic is that the math is limited by the insurance companies max pay in their policy and the assets of the person that hit them\nThose two things out of the gathers most you're going to get that because there is no magic money doesn't just appear because some tragic and this is definitely\nTragic four of the situation I'm so sorry all are facing it\nBut that's that's how your math all shake out so when I'm going to be doing is investigating what the max pay on the insurance policy is and the asset base of the person who hit them that's the thing to piece of information I Want a real quick because then it doesn't matter if calculate ten million dollars is the settlement also if there's nobody gonna tell you something\nPoor can pay us [laughter] this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\nLike yeah this is James Giles producer of the day rarely show I'm excited to announce the we're now hearing on the next hundred radio stations across the country by one near you got a brand new dot com and show\nThat you know that's fifty six percent of homeowners are over ... for their insurance and\nThen three drivers is doing the same thing that means there's a pretty good chance your spending more than you have to all insurance\nThat folks just because you're paying a lot of money doesn't mean you have the coverage that you really when you work with in the end and then I'm sure it's a ... year get access to ensure that scary or through one person\nMeans lots of policy options and the little work on your part our doors local providers are independent agents or will bond a policy that works best for\nYou it doesn't take long to get a quote and you can save hundreds sounds like a no brainer to me go to Dave Ramsey dot com defined the
