yes\nYeah been there are very cool that a book signing up in that area one time at the mall fairly cool we're going to go there good to have you guys so you're here to do a debt free scream yes so much of your paid off we paid off three hundred Ninety four thousand dollars\nUp to this day it took a total of nine years you know a very good you're breaking their between two Dave where for\nLike two years um I went to school finish that at a construction injury but\nYeah it's a it's a long story and uh what was your range of income to those nine years yeah so we were one forty ... down to eighty five for the for years he went to college and then now up to two hundred and ... actual what are you all do for a living\nSo we're both in sales and medical device and he's heavy construction or a very good yeah and I'm guessing what is this being nine years in this much money at your house yes yes you\nWant to be weird how old\nAre you too so I'm forty six ... well All right\nAnd they'll pay for a lot of the\nLaw but it's good way to go to answer for a while we do\n[laughter]\nWell good job you guys what's his house worth I'm ... now it's probably for twenty yeah wow\nPeretti may yeah the market has gone crazy and Phoenix and we were so fortunate because when we moved there was a very low the market and the and we didn't have any debt so we could afford that was the only you know debt that we had we bought a house and then we paid it off I Know\nIt was incredible journey I took full two years to pay it off and that was our gazelle intense so it was um\nIt was hard it was hard um I Would just want to say what you do makes a different all through your marriage like we've grown so much\nAs a couple of going through this process this is not just to get out of debt show it's not just money it's your whole life in your marriage and so I I just wanted to mention that I mean it's been a fantastic journey\nIncredible I'm so proud of you who are your biggest cheerleaders yeah so my dad was a huge cheer leader and as I say my older brother damn yeah yeah you know so it's a couple of family members on the good side yeah we're not on the dark side of the force that's\nRight [laughter] I\nLove it right way to go you guys yeah that's so cool so what started you're doing this what made you say we can actually pay off our house 'cause most people never bother\nYeah well because the journey happened so long ago the beginning of the journey he had come home from work one day and he just said hey\nI heard this guy on the radio talking about money I was always reading books about finance and he said take a look at this guy and see what you think so the next weekend your CDs came the ... the very first set of CDs came from that you had created I listen to those CDs and literally that day my life from awesome\nThat we had everything we could ever dreamed up our big house in our jet skis and so it was awesome until it was an awesome because we didn't own anything Mm nothing and it was just so\nRude awakening and it was so scary to sit there thinking we don't own anything\nAnd so that started the journey so lots of life happened in between the removed about five times before we finally settled in Cape creek Arizona Erica hurt a on a construction job he was builder um and when that happened that changed our life because he chose to go to college you said you know we need to go to college\nThat's what took the income down because I had to work and we cash flow to it you know and then once that was all done\nI printed the amortization scheduled for the house and I brought it to him and I said I think we can pay the house off in two years and I said you're crazy yeah [laughter] but I really thought we could but this last two years has sucked it was hardly at all\nYou so you did the three Ninety four really in two years or how much of the three Ninety four was the house to\nHouse was two hundred and forty thousand okay we did that who you're forty in two\nYears yeah whoa that was the gazelle intense where we ate the gazelle 'cause we were so tired and rice and beans yeah\nYeah he cleaned up all the jet skis and the other stuff in the previous seven years yeah so then when you look down and go okay game on now we're going to do the house and you leaned into it with wild good that's\nWhich are in rental property number two\nUm we owe one sixty five and it's worth about Ninety five\nRight you're making a little profit you may get a lot\nNo it's about a thousand a month I mean it's definitely not\nAnd all that and that's you know when our job you\nKnow that your gross that's before you count lake in sea and major repairs that come up\nThat that's the gross cash flow the difference in the rent and the payment shut twelve thousand dollars a year minus vacancy minus a an occasional eating an air system or roofs occasionally you're you're making a little bit of money\nBut yeah you know you yeah fire five ... five grand foreground something like that I'm On a year something like that over our air raid I mean some years will be better than others and that kind of on a bunch of rental property shark and kind of do these things are my\nDutch um the uh uh ... and what's your household income\n[noise] um if we bring about a hundred and ten gross to tell you what do you own your home\nOur primary uh we just purchased that um ten months ago we\nOwe to eighty worth about three hundred\nOkay right right and so he's saying um you've got a hundred and thirty and uh fifty or so so you got a hundred and eighty if you saw both of these give or take 'em expenses that you could throw at your two eighty\nAnd that's right he's saying to do your saying we're making a little money um I like rental property these are good runners I think I Want to keep it and that's the discussion on the right\n[noise] yeah 'cause my thought is on as soon as breakdown we have about ten thousand dollars in aid and got them and you say you have is that um we have combined probably twelve thousand 'cause we took him we had a lot but we took a bite out of it after that so\nThat helped me out there now is like baby steps are very clearly defined that you do write one before you do the other you can't sort of do them or you can have your plan but you can't call them baby steps I won't let you now you're going to do your plan okay if you're going to be my plan you'd rather check today and be debt free\nYeah the only reason I was hesitant because now 'cause you're doing airplane and you\nKnow it's just that the end of the year I'm always really tough and I feel you know a fireman\nSo it was just there in the event that on my condition that don't come through for the next three nights [noise] um I was afraid to liquidate at Atlantic I don't think an ax three nights in a tough spot so I figure on Christmas and everything I vowed then I Would just try to track\nMhm okay let your plane\nOakland or any of\nThe uh uh you know ... ...\nYou're not making a ton of money on these properties you don't have a ton of margin in them so they can slip you're pretty quick if a ... at a minimum you know a good compromise between the two every I'm a rental property nut I Love it I Love real estate\nAnd I want to try and keep 'em if you want to keep them in the big one that's got more margin in in more equity in it is the most appealing to me\nThe ... the two hundred Ninety five over one sixty five one and so on my way one and dumped the other one\nThe fifty thousand to move the needle much but the one that only got a fifty thousand more equity you know hardly making anything on that and that you're in a gash bread on that at all in which means that it could turn upside down on ya meaning if it went vacant for three months you can be writing checks\nBy the year lose money on that house if you're a three month vacancy if the market softened up so you just don't have any wiggle room and that thing so it's as much a liability is is it is an asset in your situation even though technically forty so I'm probably dumping the little one as a compromise\nBetween the two of them and um\nAnd if you're going to hold the other one didn't you guys just got a you know we'll start working these baby steps the right way\nAnd following them through in getting the emerging them cheap on done and get a proper emergency fund in place and and if your income as volatile enough that you need to have an additional account to cover of our income volatility to separate from your emergency fund than you could build that went up to\nAnd they'll just some cash position so that you're not constantly you know in the lurch back and forth menu making good money overall but you kind of living hand to mouth anyway\nAnd that that's that's the cycle you're trying to break some good question thanks for joining us\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is with us in San Francisco\nHi Mike how are you have how you doing better than I deserve what's up so I just started\nIn October here um and I got my that's what I got my start are set so I have um with the money make over um I got an eight hundred my emergency fund so I'm among baby step on um the first time I've got a budget and it's a mess it just seems like a just dial it in\n... and you're on every dollar um every dollar okay All right I'm going in a\nWhile it just seems like I I kind of make an estimate of where I what I think things are going to cost and then I just either it seems like it goes over and then there's things that I think we're gonna have to pay for but then there's nothing really happening it stays kind of just a doormat\nYou been doing it a whole two weeks yeah\nYeah well that you're you're just takes a little while to get other things are just in the first thing you would tell you is this when you're doing your every dollar budget whatever you think you're spending on food you're\nWrong but more in there but you're always people are always spend more on food and they think they are I mean I've been people go I live on twenty five dollars a month I'm going to hold it was just no way you know what I mean so whatever you think you're spending on food you're spending more\nAnd really quick I wanted to ask once it\nInvest in the financial peace university um or should I get that now are kind of get it after I'm done with my dollars and just put everything in there for them\nThat's up to you I mean you you can decide what you want it all on one of mine just give it to you and that way not to worry about it\nOh okay All right\nBut that way you can get signed up and get the every dollar plus going and that's a one year membership for that thing and then you get in the class you know you go to the non non lessons and you've got the online experience and that's going to answer a bunch of these questions as well but basically if you just visualize a yellow pad forget every dollar forget\nA budgeting and all that and just go okay here's what I make\nAt the top of the page and then every dollar of my at every one of those dollars needs an assignment going down the ... Exxon food and why on utilities and Z on rent and so on down the page until every single dollar has an assignment you don't have any left over money in your budget\nIt is a great up I made it it definitely the fifth one I've I've done other one horn than before the definitely the easiest is are\nThe Harlem the problem is is you're facing your reality it's not the app and it's not the system even it's just the first time you do a budget you suck at it you know and it just takes a month and then the next months you'll get better really about the third month you're doing it it'll be accurate\nIt'll take about the rhythm of about Ninety Days about three times through it and you'll go\nOh I'm not forgetting all soccer pictures of him I got this one all day on you know and we know what the food really cost and we know what the utilities really are and\nGot a few things that are fixed that are predictable and you'll rent or motors climate that's fixed thing we know what that is nice but some of these other things you're just you're taking your best guess and and it just takes a little while to get the trial and error get the course\nOf course corrections done and get adjusting so you'll get it on I'll have to like pick up we'll get your signed up for financial\nBanks germ ... or ... or associate producer John de Ramsey your host and we'll be back [noise]\n\nPlays chief production officer for the show and\nHere's a little tip for two thousand and Eighteen to go download our revamp Dave Ramsey show apple app store\nAlways listening to your feedback in ... new features to make it even better check it out\n[noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting\nTerm life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things ahead\nK.
