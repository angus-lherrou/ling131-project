{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "They're structured and you'd have to talk with his uh uh uh attorney and was from tax advice to find out how it's structured somebody's in California as well\nThat's correct down that that's the first thing you need to figure out what's taxes are going to be and what the lawyers' fees are going to be and then you know what you're going to happen that the second thing then is figure out what we're going to do I would I Would urge him to pretend like this money's not there by and large\nIf let's say there's twenty million after taxes just use a number okay and if you if you've pulled a million out to start a business and to coast for a little while emotionally\nAnd that leaves you're Nineteen million that you just pretend like you're not there\nThat makes sense that's pretty bad yeah I mean you could buy anything you want to do with that right that's a lot of freeway money okay sounds so absolutely something along those lines and then what I Want him to do is to build himself a uh the Bible says in the\nUh in ... in the abundance of counselors there are safety in the multitude of counsellors there's safety so he needs to build himself a little board of directors\nA needs an estate planner\nA that's a lawyer and it's a tax professional probably that as a lawyer but at a minimum is a CPA um [noise] a needs an investment person in his corner I'm\n... probably you when someone else sitting there that'll look at him and telling me stupid when he was being stupid and he needs to to commit himself to\nGathering information from this group of people before he does something\nDoes that make sense because yeah white people lose money like this is is that they go off on their own and they don't have the tools mentally to to manage this and you've got to put some people in your life not that do it for you but the coach you\nAs a group to do this I don't want one person managing it well then that's how I get shy strict right\nAnd I and I don't want you doing it by yourself because you're probably not completely equipped\nBut we're going to put a group of people around him if he wants to do some real estate and he has a high quality real estate person sitting on his little board rights but we've got a CPA we gotta stay planner we got a tax person may be a real estate person may be an investment person in the mutual funds world and then we're going to build a game plan here this is what we do with like an NFL player that asked us what to do\nThey get they get a ten million dollar signing bonuses and they're really good at football but they are not really good money\nAnd so they don't if you don't end up on the front of Sports Illustrated be one of those stupid people that lost a million dollars here's how you do it you put some people in your corner that teach you coach you and guide you as a group\nYou don't have one person doing it and then you gradually over the years become very adept at managing twenty million dollars\nWith the help of these people teaching you and they all need to have the heart of a teacher they don't need to be arrogant and bossy\nBut then and they need to say they need we'll look at him and telling the truth and kindly but go listen here's why you don't want to do that you can do it but here's why you don't want to do that and then and he needs to commit to keeping his hands off of the bulk of it and put it in investments forget it's there\nAnd he can live the rest of his life easy easy but if he goes and decides to open up twenty million dollar technology thing he's going to lose it all by the ... three years from now all the money will be gone\nYeah that's what I'm afraid of too yeah I'm so don't do that you know don't don't don't open a twenty million dollar businesses don't open a business that takes up all this to open a business it's\nVery small he's got plenty of money he doesn't have to prove anything okay take your time either tortoise don't be the hair\nAnd just take your time put a group of counselors and the multitude accounts for their safety put a group of counsellors in your life that are professionals in the different areas that can speak to you teach you and how old is he today\nTwenty eight so the goal is by the time he's thirty eight he has a clue\nOkay yeah along the lines of managing twenty freaking million dollars\nIn it'll take ten years for him to intellectually an emotionally get his arms around it and he'll lose it all\nIf he starts trying to do one or two plays with all that money\nI'm going to open a traitor pizza parlors all gone it's all gone yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna be the next Facebook no you're not it's all gone\nIt's all gone OK so take a small amount of it and get yourself back to work to give you the dignity of work and to create an income where you really don't need any of that money any way and it's just sitting there growing and then this horrible tragic event\nTurns into a financial blessing that changes his family tree for the you know for generations to come\nBecause he's wise with it does that make sense\nYes thank you very much appreciate all the

are few hours but uh when I go over and watch a little football I guess hopefully what part of knocks we all live in uh we live in West Knoxville okay very cool while I was born just over there ...\nThere were welcome gosh do your debt free scream I Love it how much of your paid off a hundred and eighty thousand to look at you that's awesome how long does that take six and a half years six and a half years and your range of income during that time\nAnd starting out at ... at Seventy five thousand and ending around a hundred and sixty thousand\nGood for you you guys are killing it what do you do for a living\nI'm a licensed clinical social worker\nA construction project manager for a interstate retailer\nUh-huh okay very good well you guys are killing it way to go man like you saw what kind of that was one hundred and eighty thousand dollars and I like eight\nThousand was my car and a hundred and Seventy thousand with our wonderful student loans from a private Christian university\n... we were expensive spouses to each other oh okay so this you drop some coin yeah All right and um\nThen six and a half years that's a long time to pay off the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when he told me six years or so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually hum when we went through financial piece at our church at the time\nI'm One of the things that you mentioned in your video was a take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and you said take cash what'd you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and slashed the cash and and I didn't talk to them that way so\nWe're at a furniture store and I'm a very not confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took cash in and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we're trying to buy for our department at the time and\nI'm flashing the cash and saying hey I'm I'm going to walk if if we can't make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up by\nUs out of that that that is just\nTo show that there is a lot of negotiation from the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting out their finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this\nPet feeling in her stomach those are where just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and and so when we started the class the now down a budget and did the ... and we were really on Christmas Day for the ...\nJust really got serious about it and and I think the big part and for us for as far as\nDeciding to really and try to work on maybe step too as\nWe paid by car off a relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first pretty big\nBonus from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with the money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time where like where we just their budget you know a few months ago and said that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which will be able to take that ever and that's okay but we add\nWhy wouldn't you make a hundred and sixty thought of any debt ... years old are you in our first for now we have two kids so that makes a lot of kids [laughter]\nAt least in some country yeah [laughter]\nThat yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us and we put that big lot some money and our first student loan payment and there was an awful feeling it hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year or so last year the income doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct then and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year a kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end of Donald income comes up right ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this pretty well 'cause six and a half\nHuge\nAnd oh go ahead and I think for me the hardest part was and starting it and\nJust seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause they need\nA hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper\nOr you know to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan and that was just such a victory feeling for us\nAnd so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever and to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to the\nYou know I think for me it's just as the sacrifice um you know the world we live and just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying new nice things and I'm just constantly you know telling ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one else group and I really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted\nIs no insurance except you probably would want a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which are fairly inexpensive honor\nYou have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know a point that goes unmentioned is the fact that he's insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent of review and ... and I never raised her prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nGood money trying to be noisy but are you making at fifty bucks a patient I'm I I I make a monthly you making any money\n[laughter] that's what we're going to be married and has been acquired yeah yeah I mean this has\nNot been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices afloat or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospitals are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's worked out\nEvery day saint poor people in America people we defined as poor\nOr lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out what is the pack and pay above the Z pack\nWhich I don't know yet they should be able to get that think about the poor and secrete or the more you need an MIT did a study on Oregon's Medicaid system in only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient\nThey believed to have a a functioning current car insurance you gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are\nAnd how many patients you have\nA we have about six or seven hundred per doctor\nOkay so you're like all the way and I was just like most practice is probably most of your patients like made I really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know say let's go fishing together hum\nThis most people dread but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice where they're calling you every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our ... and our lives after you uh we had her height we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stops and you know we factored that in um the only part of the\nProgram we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land up this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after this so now with or a thousand practices nationwide already practice and when the director model\nOr we're looking at increased that just by thirty percent with one conference alone or the interest is massive will keep sign growing and as long as we could policies were placed the state and federal level that continue to allow these practice to to grow\nAnd blossom or you'll see this movement weaving all across the country are getting better access better care for their cost\nOf a sudden I got to tell you any Democrat that is telling you anything about healthcare that's out now is they're talking point we're offering healthcare a ... and Republicans will take care of preexisting conditions that line\n... ... lie as keep your doctor keep your plan and save money and why would you trust the people that burns you the first time so that's their talking point in the final week of the

doing this for one of ultimately and we know it's not just pile up money okay the reason we're piling up money is what you know and what are we going to do with what is it we're trying to accomplish that's your personal thing and then a subset of that is your\nYour why in the different areas of your life the reason for your your mission statement so yeah you'd have a a personal mission statement so to speak um that that attaches to who you are and and then your career your marriage your parenting your\nPhysical activity uh your intellectual growth your spiritual growth are all ...\nAnd so you

but that's that's my view on it um and of course my opinions always worth what you pay for it but uh it just seems to me if you had a\nBusiness reason for being that was different than your personal

within two or three block area of your house\nAbout the typical homes and there's not really a typical home in our area it's all over the place because of tours property there's you know Fifteen hundred square foot home and then there's also three million dollar homes across the street so I'll come from my home is about four four ten or twenty\nYeah that one when I was asking I was trying to determine if you turned over to build the neighborhood it doesn't sound like a no because it's an area around the area and it's got this wide diverse a price range and that doesn't mean cause I don't want you get to build a nine hundred thousand dollar home on a six hundred thousand dollar street\nRight yeah and I couldn't get out and we do have a to point three million dollar home just right

or just um you know I've never spoken with any expert about this and I'm not sure if this\nWas a building you know I mean there's two or three factors one is um you don't want to rebuild the neighborhood we address that too is you want to seek in your family handle you know construction noise\nFor a whatever time it takes you to put this thing up shouldn't be Ninety day project maybe two or three months can they put up with that well they ought to be able to refer ... that's what we're going to do because moving is more disruptive\nThan that\n[noise] play and this project that we are considering doing just because of the the industry that I man or thinking of going it's more like a fix one project so I mean we're we're considering adding almost four thousand square feet to the home\nOh wow you're just almost rebuilding another home\nYeah to basically tripling the size of the home now\nYou know uh so you're going to end up mortgage when you're done then\nWhy a bigger mortgage or maybe I think we're going to end up somewhere in the Fort twenty four thirty\nAnd what's your house I am household income my my wife makes about says about fifty five to six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from one of my ... year\nLast year we were I was somewhere in the two twenty area\nOkay what are you going to worry about her income you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage it's almost like you're building a house correct and you can tell\nYou when you're done you need a fully you need a regular\nFifteen year fixed rate mortgage or the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there then yes I Would do that um I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project in your living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... four thousand square foot addition to a Nineteen hundred square foot house\nGender is weather's intact cannot Hi ginger how are you\nI'm doing All right good how can I help you\nWant to know is my husband and I we have work constantly ... ... and we have finally paid off our market care of our cars everything everything we own it pay are great you know we have so much um\nWe're still working that we are we have been trying I thought oh security ... as far as he ... a year and me\nAlmost all year next mhm and I think now we have that say well now last night we had been getting all that and the typing mhm last\nNight to not get hit by we had been putting our income that we weren't at inciting living off of the security okay my question to you and when our retirement or why they're fighting\nA that we eat out mhm and what I think it would be fine how are you here where you are in security\nWhy when he got much retiring at the end of next year\nYou know how old are you how old are you I'm sixty thanks and he is okay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay in the Koran one we don't have a hundred and twenty thousand and our next and we have a lot at another hundred thousand\nMhm okay that's two hundred and twenty thousand yeah and I'm just round numbers I mean if you made 'em ten percent or there'll be twenty two thousand dollars a year okay okay\nI had never figured\nYou know and so if you invest and we did that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too\nThat um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly uh I mean you you you have\nTwo thousand dollars a month to liberal but I mean you got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money is we're talking about here and um\nAnd plus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers then you can retire if you want to but a ... that's not going to be an easy I mean it's not going to be retiring and luxury uh but you shouldn't have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off so that's good\nUm I'd love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you work a little bit more in a knockout that might be up not be a bad thing but if you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not set up a thing where I'm dreaming down\nThat two hundred and twenty systematically just to retire now because that's there's an end to that game called hunger and not only get there\nYou don't want to destroy this do so you just live off the good golden eggs only so whatever you know you sit down with your investment professional if you don't have one sit down with one of our smart Mr pros and talk about investing there's two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you did it creates an end\nUm that you can live off of that plus your Social Security and if you could do that then you're in a position to do it\nAnd um but again it's not going to be um\nA a a a luxurious retirement you're not traveling the world and uh you know and that kinda stuff on this income uh but but but I think you can do it it just a matter are you willing to live that frugally and put your budget\nTogether and say these are the numbers and I'm going to live on less than this and that's the only way we can retire and then against Saddam was more pressure pro clicked smart buster Ramsey dot com and listen to people in your area we recommend

Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you to better deal yeah go ahead and take all the money you can get you know\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy show\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that are invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in\nGood shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is uh is is way above normal 'cause normal just sucks okay you got to weigh better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\nOh shallow wanting to go get a loan from the bank\nAnd by the car right okay um\n[noise]\nWell I mean there's two there's two things that people here want one is is she's grown person and you know we don't tell are grown kids what to do we merely try to influence them but the other the other thing that's a pool is is what I Do something\nTo what I participate in an activity was one of my children that I thought was bringing them harm even if they're grown\nAnd the answer to that would be no and you are working to get out of debt your son is working to get out of that you guys are made the decision that being in debt on cars on the other thing is is a bad idea it's not good for your finances and to turn around put her into ever participate in an activity\nIs not an act of love and so um I appreciate her\nSentiment that she's standing on her own and she can do whatever she wants she is right but as your mom if I'm Ninety and you're eighty five are and you're and you're Seventy or whatever I I'm Still going to love you and I'm Still not going to participate in an activity that's bringing you harm\nMhm I Love you too much to do that and uh and if you don't understand that I you know you have the right to be mad or you have the right\nTo think that I'm outlined but I'm just cannot in good conscience participate in an activity that's not good\nFor you I Love you know\nI wouldn't sell it to her okay if I were in a power\nIn your shoes I'm just thinking through how I Would I've got grown kids and one of them came to me and said you know I Want to do this thing and you're going to participate in this thing that that did it I don't agree with and that I don't think is good without good for them that I'm not going to do it they should buy or five thousand dollar carpet cash for it\nMhm\nNow how much debt do you have not counting your home\nI we have a hundred dollars a day and what is your house while in office at one eighty\nOkay so how quickly are you going to have the hundred thousand paid do you think\nWe're looking at two years\nThat's about as low as they should take max fifty a year making one eighties not exactly\nDeeply deeply sacrificing I'm now given all of those numbers\nFour thousand dollar doesn't matter much you could just show or the car for four or five thousand okay and not you know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into debt I'm not going to participate in that activity okay but if you want to sell it to our cheap and just help her\nUm because the four thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much in out of a hundred you follow me ... what moves the need a lot of a hundred is you're getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared this debt really really fast so given those numbers I might\nGive up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay cash five thousand you're going to have the car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into that\nYou're going to
