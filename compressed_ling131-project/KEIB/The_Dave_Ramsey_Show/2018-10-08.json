zero and I had two of 'em are three of them for three years later\nAnd that started the whole process over I had to go back and distribute those because they were not allowed to report that um they did ultimately get paid 'cause I went back paid my bankruptcy but um as a moral thing not as a legal thing but anyway all that to say\nYou've got to have the thing completely squeaky clean and then apparently if they haven't changed at this month and they don't start counting your rent or they didn't start counting\nSomething else that we do know that they count then your credit score will go to

yeah certainly are you but I also want to catch\nI Would love to know a guy I'll get chance awesome but it's all about what I can get you will get you a pair of tickets so you're here to do your debt prescribe I Am a lot of it I'm not sure if you paid off thirty one thousand seven hundred dollars so I Love it and how long did this take\nIt took three years almost to the days since I started the financial these very good and you're ranger income during that time about forty seven thousand two fifty thousand do or what do you do\nYou um by day I'm tech support at trouble and expense software\nAnd by nights and weekends I work in the film industry mostly doing onset audio a button or other things too fun good for you very cool what kind of ... was the thirty two thousand it was mostly student loans but then also a car loan and the car repair loans to\nAuction okay so you're a single guy making forty seven thousand pay off thirty two thousand and three years which is a you know basically a thousand bucks a month give or take during that time average and uh\nThe that's really watching what you're doing you brush to catch the whole thing yes it was it was very tight ... when I was a at least at the beginning stages I figured it out that um if\nIf I budgeted everything out and all of just the basic bills in food and gas I had about forty dollars left over for months while ago it was it was tied up some extra jobs and that helped but you're over ... got a little bit out of film but some doesn't pay too much of a good deal\nGood deal so three years ago you said you started financial ... journey began other than that\nI'm kind of a story well first of all my sister who's here um I did uh did your program and deter debt free scream and that's where I first heard about you and I was and so I learned some of it by I was most is kind of but I also we're like oh that's good enough I got it um which wasn't smart or\nUm so then it was in twenty four teen which is when I moved sixty miles away from home just by myself to an apartment\nA sign a release everything figured out everything was good and I had to move on the seventh of August and the sort of August my car broke down completely engine died everything is done wow and so I'm like I Need to move I Need to move now I have no way to get there in a way to get my job when I get there don't know anybody up there\nUm so I was just ran out and bought a car and I end up to that point I'd been smart\nAnd only buying a cash in cash for cars but at this point I was like\nEvery time I get breaks down in a year I'm tired of holding like Paul ... and I like I was just like that kind of looks nice I'm gonna get that one [laughter] pay too much for it I'm pretty sure and um and so\nBut of course I'd already signed a lease so that was something I hadn't taken into account right and so moved up there and about four months later my that car the engine fry broke down the exact reason that I bought a new car is what happened\nAnd so it took out a car repair alone and um because I was like I'm not gonna like oh this guy just got four months ago I'm going to keep it\nAnd um so yeah so replaces the engine at that point in time it was like there was I was over drafting it was it was it was bad um and because I wasn't budgeting and um I think I don't know if we're moving gift or if it was for um\nFor a Christmas gift but Carney gave me a uh the box for financial peace but I was still stubborn I'm so like I put it on my dresser and I'm like I\nI'll probably do that I'll probably get around to jump out of sleep in the same room with the box it'll be okay I just wanted to actually learn it you know by us most is\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my parmesan she could fly out of Minneapolis to do or debt free scream and I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that and we are good sister rules are exactly [laughter] so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factor so I finally got it so it was her fault [laughter] like all\nOur minimum wage to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process that causes you to be here to do your debt free sharing Zach and I'll take it that work such good family stuff right\nThere and I should say it ends up being a pretty good book end you because I went out of 'em got out of debt and this last April and um the singles at my church decided to go on this big trip to Montana\nHow old are you I'm twenty four of them and how long you been married five years you all had this discussion about the way your feeling about this check yes absolutely what he's trying to\nLose any we uh we just need to pray about it and figure out what's what's the most wise decision\nWhich I how much of the check for twenty seven five will not pay off everything I'm not\nQuite but we do have a five hundred and savings so we could take a I think maybe the ... of that\nAnd be done with everything everything but the house yeah OK yeah good and then begin your emergency fund so who passed away my grandfather okay All right\nWell there's a couple of gauges we want to do a number one we want to be biblical wise which is what she was saying and pray about this and the number two we want to do something with his money that your grandfather would be sitting in heaven and see you're doing this and smile\nOddly enough these are actually the exact same things\nUm because when you start doing smart things with money that's going to be honoring to his memory in other words right there and so paying off the debt would not make him mad as long as you had a process to never go back in and that's what bothers you a little bit so what I Want you guys to do is I Want you to go back through financial peace university\nAnd I want you to heart this money in a side savings account that is not attached in any way to an ATM card a debit card or your checking account where you can't do it without a better for the bank\nOr you have to physically go down there and make it hard to get to impart there for nine weeks until you go through the classes to gather you've got the one year membership I'm going to pay for it for you to go to financial piece university okay\nAnd that and attributes university is a one year membership you've got nine lessons in nine weeks you've seen some of them some of them have been re done since you saw them\nAnd you go through those then when you get done with that I think you'll know what to do and you take that money and work the baby steps but uh the problem is as you said the get out of jail free card if you don't change your behaviors and have something more than just a promise to yourself you're going to\nStraighten up then you could really cause a problem lighter um yeah and so what you want to do is proved to yourself during this nine weeks that you have changed your behaviors and when you all are looking at each other going okay we're really doing this we're not screwing around were not goofing off we're not going to issue\nWe're really going to do it no itching Dave ... financial ... the issue wise ... we're not going to ... and so that'll get you into a mess and so you know I Would if I knew I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do this up\nAnd that's what I'm telling you to do a is or go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd then stay you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go to the legacy journey class online or you can you can get into groups on line and say you know ... to continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that\nUm we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff though\nAnd it's a really really really incredible value and uh it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this and\nSome day when you're doing really good find a guy who um feels like a product called and you help him out and that's all I ask you to do things\nFor the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up I'm\nI Am a newer listener forgive me for my ignorance I Am on baby step to we have our housing our savings that are currently working on our we have about thirty forty thousand dollars I mean that includes our cars we do not have a mortgage we currently right now my question as\nWe're going to have paid off in the next two years maybe even a year right\nNow we have a plan that we wanted to take our children into an RV for about two years and travel the country however we would have to finance ticket Harvey and something to where we feel like kind of actor her kids are getting older I'm terribly would\nNot like to wait if possible but I just wanted to see what your advice for America to be\nA sneak dream I live in the dream that's cool very cool well I'm gonna I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money off on broke people right and um\nAnd if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people have you ever tried to sell used RV\nAnd seen other people are harming mode yeah possible to get rid of them are they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything with wheels and motors they are mathematically horrendous\nOr they're just a mess\nAnd so um the other the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... you can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd uh so you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nI'm sixty thousand okay I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an ...\nTo be that would um that would suffice for the two year period of time and then if you saw it at somewhat of a lost at least you got you know what I mean dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have and you finance it you're going to turn it into a nightmare\nRight it's going to cause a problem for your family 'cause I mean you put a hundred grand and an RV by the time you get home is worth fifty\nRight and you're going to be stuck and ... all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement\nI mean it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or to look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and turn it back in\nA doubt there is one they're probably very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is a different um\nAnd when you add all of this up it might be that you guys could stay in your you could travel in your car um or your issue be or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you out at all\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on the transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want your dream would be a nightmare so do it with no debt you do it used to\nAnd um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you got so much to do that while you're working to get your other debts bite off right now\nAnd then if you want to say about fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand ... or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life but if you if you just go write a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess kiddo and I don't want that for you I Want you to win\nA thanks for the call well was fourteen\nAlmost Fifteen million of you listening each week we know how valuable the stories on the show are in providing your motivation and inspiration if you

[noise]\n\nNo one works as hard as business owners your time is priceless because your work is your passion one of the things that can suck a lot of your time is quarterly taxes\nI'm Talking about all the bookkeeping that no warm orange you about in fact business owners been nearly a hundred and twenty hours on their tractors that equals up to three weeks that you are doing what you set out to do in the first place\nHow much business are you missing out on all for what to be stressed out every quarter and still uncertain on whether or not you're doing the right\nNot okay at all Amy is with us in Akron, Ohio Hi Amy welcome to the Ramsey show\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up\nWhile I had a um kind of the issue and I my um my father in law recently had a stroke and um and so he has been in a nursing home for about\nA month and a half ... um my husband and I are on baby steps back so we're actually thinking of looking into buying a new house\nThat might have an in law suite so we had maybe do home care at our house with him um we're kind of just trying to figure out what would be better financially efficient half our house now which we owe about um Ninety thousand on or buy a house\nThe one that we kind of we're looking at on and so it's like um like around three hundred\nAnd what's her current home worse\nUm it's probably like one fifty okay\nSo you can move up a hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah and you're using his moving into the father in law suite as the justification for doing that but obviously the whole house that the increase is not all about the father in law suite correct\nYeah we're going to upgrade our house so then the next few years anyway what's\nYour household income\nUm it's about two and fifty dollars a day\nOr you can afford it if you put it on a Fifteen year fixed or less\nAll right I'd prefer to live because they don't want you every time you only get paid off start Fifteen Years over again that kind of reached the purpose right right purpose would be to become dead for a show is have financially I'm obviously not able to care for himself obviously there is no other family members\nUm my husband has a brother a we're kind of a better situation I guess to to take something like that on my father in law does have a pretty he has a decent amount of money so he um he he could keep them in a nursing home for a little while until the money runs out\nStress for well I mean you may want to sit down um you see capable of making decisions with the stroke\nHe is yeah I think they're um mentally and physically had how much money when\nYou say he's got a fair amount of money\nUm he's probably a like a three hundred thousand [noise]\nOkay well I mean you could make a deal with him that if you've got your half of the inheritance\nPrior to his death that you would agree to care for him until his death and go and get your one fifty and then you can about pay cash for theirselves\nYeah okay and you know you would want to clear that with a brother as well everybody needs to be paid just as a kind of stuff is was apple off\nSo you're real careful with it and go okay you're still going to get your body but we're two hours now you know and we're going to care for him and we'll take care of him a but that's a heavy commitment on your old part right and in other words if I were in your shoes the way I Would want to analyze that would be\nIf you reach a point being at home and your husband's at work and you don't want to do this care that you guys would be willing to write the check for the in home care nurse\nMm\nYeah I um I think that we'd probably still need a nurse to come in\nIt is good that's good well I mean you can decide how you want to do this but that's one way you could put some of the money together\nAnd not happened to a complicated thing where he owns half the house and then you have to deal with your brother in law when he dies 'cause the now range half your house or half half of your house or some kind of crap like that I don't want to get it right that that's that's a nightmare\nBut you can just bought a house and go we make two hundred fifty\nAnd we can afford it and we're gonna put on Fifteen year and you know he can use this hundred and fifty to buy the in home care um however you want to do it that's the way to do it there's nothing wrong with that I Would have in my mind you know just your exit strategy is being you know if he gets really in bad shape and you have to put him in a nursing home are we going to handle that\nAnd then number two we gotta get brother in law everybody needs to be on board on this everybody's got to feel good about this man several in person meeting with dad sitting there telling everybody what he wants to do his money is
