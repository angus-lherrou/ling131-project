two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad is people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you'll come after the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right\nCause here comes resolution time and one of those things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was this is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money and that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation\nAgain if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there's no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica\nAnd so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole another piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes out\nBefore of course it I Love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great uh after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactive we identify good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of

communications professor\nThe good news is shouldn't affect the race tracks immediately and that's what we're hearing especially Santa Anita which of course a has a huge made coming up the day after Christmas\nAnd they're running right now won't affect anything now so we'll keep our eyes and ears on that but a ... I guess you'd call that white people's problems rich people's problems they're just trying to figure out how to divvy up an awful lot of money and and the decisions that are going into that so okay uh that's happening [laughter]\nBoy what else All right let's get to today's racing cars there are some good action today Santa Anita ten races um [noise] the future of the California just staff used to be down the hillside now it's going to be five for a long and the turf\nBut here's the rub we've got a bunch of brain last night is raining right now out at Santa Anita and it may ran a little bit this afternoon so I have to wait and see which races stay on the grass and which get taken off because I'm the hillside racist certainly are probably coming off\nAnd we'll have to see but I Believe quite a bit of rain last night I'm\nKind of a surprise actually at my house\nStarted raining and just so what's that um my dog certainly didn't know what was going on especially the puppy she was kind of freaked out\nSo keep an eye on the moves that are made by the management insanity and we'll find out what race to stay on the grass and what shifts over to the dirt if any based on some rather remarkable weather here in Southern California was not expecting that kind of rain and we got it and still are getting something so\nThat's a big factor today full fields all day to day Senate Nita I'm mean you know not the classy us card but boy as far as a betting card really strong a average field size is about ten today um [noise] the rainbow six\nThey're pushing it hard um\nThere's four hundred thousand in it now you know I'll just say what I always said about this but if you're going to put it in a fairly small ticket that's a crazy ticket trying to be you know the loan winner and scoop up the pot and get the million bucks this weekend you know go for it that's fine that's how you're playing it I don't know twenty four dollars twelve dollars whatever bunch of long shots go ahead [noise]\nOtherwise it's not a good play until closing day\nAh then if it carried over all the way through it'll be a huge pot and then it's guaranteed payouts and that will be the day to place so\nYou know that's my thought on that is building and building and building there's been a couple of close calls\nBut to be the single ticket pretty tough right now I'm so good luck if you're doing it that way if not recommend waiting a cause otherwise it's not a good bet they take away too much out if you happen to hit six other people do you're you're not getting what you served so\nHum interesting move by CNN you know I can understand why they did it and that's how that one's playing out All right uh again the featured the California this death five for a long time the turf how where does that\nWhat's up with that we don't see five for longs interpret sand Anita I I Can't get used to it I guess I Will but\nPretty weird I'm just to see that the gate over there on the turf course man I don't know I have to ask Stephen ... what he thinks but boy it's a it's an odd sight it's a competitive race\nUm if it stays on the turf S. Y. sky the most interesting contest and has not running Fifteen months but a very talented a Philly for filled the motto\nIn order to Nick Alexander\nOne for one of the turf three for for career she is the class or the race race might be a little too short for her but I think if it stays on the grass and she can handle the soft grass well we'll see\nSo a good competitive race tenth races a good one that's down the hill that might come off the hill so we will see what happens out at a Senate needed today or whether a bit of a factor but again fulfilled so should be a fun competitive down there I'm Out of town keen land\nWhere they've had some some wild racing some good racing third graph has dropped some some huge numbers over there the past week or ten days\nOr they have a good future today to Q. E. two on the grass three year old Phillies we have a Southern California invader or ... is there ... is in to ride 'em on the grass yes through reform ounce of keep an eye and can't\nUh in the future in in a couple of other races he shows up on a couple of horses that I think you should kind of go wait a minute and take a second look at a\nDead horse with Kent the board you fly across the country has focused tends to uh go up a little bit so the key to again a three year old ... mile an eighth on the turf I'm rushing fall is going to be the big favorite there five six career I think there's a a\nEuropean has big chance mission impassable um ... horse that one agreed to in June on soft turf they've had some rain there so the turf there's probably are going to be a little bit soft and this is a Philly with some real talent and uh she comes over\nLooking to make some noise here and might might just do that a Russian fall is going to be pretty tough to draw the outside\nUh she has two for two key inland she gets passed a law now for Jeb brown so she is absolutely the one to beat\nA this is a horse that won the Breeders' Cup last year a at del mar the juvenile Philly turf at three to one very impressive stretch run and uh she really hasn't done anything wrong and her career so let's see what happens is killing all kinds of good racing around that big race and then at Belmont they've got six for a long term sprint\n... park and also the ... which is a mile on the turf couples could really run that was a while ago for three year old Phillies so solid card at Belmont Park\nAnd Jay in third graph of both give you play from there I think kind of a late in the card is what we're looking at yeah kind of in the back end of the card so all kinds of action all over the place and but that's how it is this time of year so excited as always here and inside racing\nAnd uh I think we've got to bring on Mr pollock and to see what he has to say Steve are you there\nI Am here how you doing\nI'm doing good I woke up this morning and uh you know I did get the the rain here last night at very disappointed 'cause it it's been a lot of time on this card and it really puts a lot of things up in the air but uh I did get a smarter and check the website I saw that the first by as out of the classic and yep\nBoy that is true that change things ... a a big scratch that is no matter who you like because that was the horse that was you know eighty\nFive Ninety percent beyond the lead Jay yeah I think that makes a big deal um what would you say you know we've never been a mental are banned but what would you say to his cancer going up with that ...\nWell they certainly improve um you know he ran a monster race in the Jockey Club\nIf he improves off that race and it was a huge effort or you know watch out and he uh he has a tremendous amount of tactical speed so now the pressure is going to be on some of the ... the other connections to see how close they want to stay and we'll see how they play it with mental some but that scratched certainly helps him a great deal um as he try you know it's\nFunny one of the things I've learned over the years I have a you know I Would get to a point\nYou know I was in my twenties and even in my thirties where if I didn't like a horse for a big race I\nReally wanted to go against that horse but I Would just praying that horse and I have I gotten older I realized that each race is completely different and it really doesn't matter I couldn't like lentils down the Kentucky Derby and a lot of people that\nAre really made a strong played fight and fat or in that race and and now they're starting to look at the source and you know from the bouncer\nI I Know that there are you on the third grab a\nNumbers on that or she probably went down which is obviously a positive for him in a class break and he's probably going to look like a horse might regrets but\nMight that might take that long look at that run\nAs there are a lot of horses in that race I\nThink are kind of mediocre and that could be a race\nThat could be there for a cake and on the crime and\nYeah it's a you know it's if you don't believe in accelerate it's a wide open race a big desks really the way to look at the classic the worst is done nothing wrong on paper all year long unbelievable year but you got the John Sadler question you got the shipping out of California question\nAnd you got the kind of odd not\nGreat when last time in the awesome again where he broke weird was why do you give them a lot of credit but he just didn't look like himself\nAnd the question is is he tailing off after the huge Pacific classic and and kind of a big long year or was that you know just the ... and he steps back up because he's the one but you know it's just harder to trust him than it has been some other horses in the past for those reasons\nActually like the fact that he didn't run so great last time great for that to me just looking at accelerate by himself a big effort from him last time and you think we got all these big airport coming in I sort of like that he\nHeld back and then maybe he comes back a little bit um so for me it was a structure negative I mean he just wasn't super impressive last out to get the job done and again I'm going to look at that as more of a positive for him but I'll\nI'll certainly be looking at all my options are for that racist as there are gonna be a lot of them and there's going to be some more of\nA big prices that have a chance to not raise\nYeah one that all throughout their and I bet a few bucks on them in the future pool a is a horse I really don't like much but there are some reasons to like him in this particular race in that's possible or he won the Stephen Foster at Churchill so he likes that track it as a quirky track horses that like it always run well on it somewhere says don't\nHe's proven he can get the distance and he's proven he likes that race track and dug O'Neill on a price worse than uh\nThe grace you never know so he wasn't working well and he's one wild card that ah I've already got some money on him so I'm good [laughter] I might have class what you got on him\nThirty two to one okay which I thought was fair you know it wasn't fifty a he'll probably be twenty to one uh you know raise time a shitty make it to the race so you know it wasn't phenomenal but he's the one where I looked at it all went you know what yeah I'll put a couple of bucks there um I thought that was a solid fair price and uh\nA golf course can get Steve's plays on the phone line eight seven seven nine one five one six one six in a racing Jason that Tom as well but you knew that uh and we got Roger new balance from third graph coming up there's not enough time really to throw out all the big winners they've had it's been a crazy run again for the last ten days off\nA couple on the on the way back but let's let me see oh Parker take us out and bring us back you're listening to inside racing on AM eleven fifty [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nMoving back they bark\nFred Wesley Ellen\nJames Brown training ground in the air to do their thing still doing this week I don't wake up one morning right\nAll right a couple of things have ... just a reminder that got some bank roll builders for the Breeders' Cup today if you play twenty dollars inexact is\nOn the Canadian international what buying which is race nine and that's a good one a lot of good Europeans and they're quitting and almost white horse named thundering blue twenty dollars inexact as bet on that race through never bet and they'll kick you back ten for the Breeders' Cup\nTo basically getting ten dollars back dislike that boom bank road builders so that's happened in the day\nUh at would buy where they're having a really nice day really nice classy card up there so we want to jump in you get ten bucks back uh for the Breeders' Cup win or lose on your twenty dollars an exact it's just like that boom boom All right\nUh like I said not enough time really to lamb all out but how about a will go backwards for graft yesterday at Kean lend forty five dollar best bet all Hansen's on deck\nAnalysis said very consistent and going to be a big price boom forty five dollar winner at Santa Anita in the last race hundred and thirty dollar best bet ... and they hit the try for three hundred and six dollars for a buck key horses tend to one ran second the other two horses ramp first and third boom boom boom\nThat was yesterday Thursday came Lyndon other best bet who ran huge a pay twelve dollars a place a ten dollar winter hundred and three dollar jak\nThen we go back to the three day weekend Monday at Santa Anita forty four dollars best bet winter de de loop just hung on at Twenty one to one uh and then at Belmont Seventeen in ten dollar best bet winters hundred dollar cold double\nSunday at Santa Anita they hit size pick threes\nPaid four hundred two fifty hundred and forty hitter really pick for for five hundred and Thirteen dollars single best bet that kind of key to all of that uh and there was more than a heck of a run and uh and I hate to prop Rodger up like that but what the heck you can handle it Roger good morning\nMorning Jews and how are you I'm fine how are you\nDoing well you know we need to throw one more a winner in their last weekend and that's golden ...\nThat's right that's right I Am radio\nYeah I did and a boy that was one of those you know you and I've watched a lot of races I I I feel like I have a good sense I'm sure you do to how things\nAre progressing and what my chances are on the turn I gave that horse no chance uh she fell back she got shuffled back a little bit the writer really started pushing and I thought oh well you know a good idea is not going to happen and man she just kept writing and grinding and grinding and grinding and got there\nThat was something I have to say very rarely do I kind of throw in the towel and then colonel turn around and get one so\nI agree with you I could win the hell was well on that one and a happy\nY'all very happy and we got a nice price to she was nine to two she went four to one at a posting them floated up instead of down which is pretty rare these days and horse with a good chance so\nUh we'll take the price as well and yeah that was a nice one the ... golden mischief and we will see her in the Breeders' Cup uh she's in tough sin tough race but she's a very tough for us and she's she's on a roll so uh\nYou know she's definitely one to keep an eye on and that's silly Amir sprint\n\nAlright where uh where do you want to jump in a lot of options um so where do you want to start today\nWe're going to start a film I Would be a couple and you mentioned earlier today who she was one of my favorite I Know it's been a while but I\nYeah I I remember her that was one ah you know she came in and everybody on okay we'll see oh okay now I see what everybody's talking about um yeah she was pretty special\nInterest rate of Belmont Park we're probably going to have a softer yielding her up there today\nAnd the horse like here is number seven good things take time ... team to one morning line there's a couple of things to like your once you get around a favor and as I said the ground are likely we saw this one was originally in Europe she's run on TALK around here so that's not going to hurt her at all so\nThis one first first couple of times this year ... to have to look forward to a very nice very number of five and a quarter\nOr react to that a little bit is on her way back and looks like she's got it back to back ah actually five and a quarter which would be a very very strong number in this race it came to walk\nSo number seven good things take time is going to be our cook some sorry\nAnd she had a nice little breaks in the last race shrimp twice at Saratoga the last one was August twenty third so plenty of time right to continue that kind of a coming back to form\nYeah absolutely six weeks into this race and shouldn't be ready to throw a nice number today\nWe're going to use her as I said what key or we're going to use or with a number five peanut go for a walk or in a very nice race class time I ever saw around she's also being the one yeah and then in number six got stormy is just to system to leave out\nSo we're gonna we're going to focus on this stuff and we're going to use and what the pie and again\nThis is race nine and a nice car to Belmont this is the ... it's one mile on the grass\nAnd the key here the seven good things take time trend Jorge a break you been having a very nice to meet a little bit under the radar their Belmont but\nHe's a he's over fifty percent and the money in these five for Twenty one on the meat so far so it's a guy who's foreigners going well and like we said\nGive is worse than nice break the the three year old silly she's definitely got some talent for a bit of a hidden number in Fifteen to one in the morning line and I think you'll get posted that uh there's there's other horses that are definitely going to take some action here including got stormy\nSo seven with five six and race nine at Belmont Park ... mile on the grass All right sir I liked that one as well it's a it's a nice play want to go from there to ...\nYeah we're going to go to the ... not one or Korea we're talking about this yesterday how many winners reacts\nThese very few you found more oh\nThis is a dream lead competitive race and you mentioned come with the prices we lately a cable like well this will\nThis way I Do it if we hit it um [noise] it's more of a train or play here with our horse that we're going to focus our number for blue collar forty to one morning line ready in the late\n... um is getting thirty seven percent cops every starter over the last Ninety Days I'll just unbelievable number\nSo you got to know raised last time I ran an eight or on the dirt was poorly but the numbers
