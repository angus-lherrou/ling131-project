more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I have heard my whole life you know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody\nWho's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact I'm Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expect in a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and she said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nAnd I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying you know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in in ...\nYou follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nThat somebody who knew he needed to lead wait until they broke from the gate solved that he got to the lead and unloaded on him and that's why the odds dropped that's the perception and that's her friend is\nSomebody say this again for all the folks listening they can do something about this and I know there's some of you out there this is going to crush the game\nI'm telling you it's going to crush horse racing in horse racing is not going to be able to compete as a gambling sport if this continues to happen it has to be stopped this death to the sport I didn't think I'd say that but after yesterday and it happening again I'm going to say because it happened to me again\nAnd the perception is too brutal it's just it's insane you can't have this twenty to one they leave the gate there hit the first turn still twenty to one and then in the middle of the race Thirteen you can't do that\nCan't have it that way um the reality is he was an overlay\nAnd be computer guys algorithms figured it out they got the money in at the last minute and of course it takes ten or twenty seconds to process it and that's why the odds changed the way they did and I'm sure that is the reality that still not good enough that is absolutely not good enough\nThese guys have gotten too good they'd been too much money they're allowed to bet a as many bets as they can in the last ten seconds which is unfair I Can't make a hundred and fifty bets they can\nSo am I pissed off yeah really pissed off and I'm also a very scared for the sport if this continues to happen it's going to drive people away and it and you're never going to attract new gambler never\nOnce they see this once or twice there out why would you play\nI bet a football game and I get six points in the game starts I got my six points that's it doesn't change nobody comes to the middle of the second quarter goes oh by the way you only get two points\nImagine if you did that well that's what's happening but that's the perception and it's it's it's brutal so great call by throw Graff uh I'm Glad I was in on it\nBut I lost thirty five percent of my bed so there you go\nSo well done by that I'm All right had to throw it out there sorry but boy this is not good I'm All right Kaitlin great race in today five straight stakes races six seven eight nine and ten the best to or the last to shed Walter mile Jay's going to talk about that\nUh the race nine is reduced eternity for two year olds who drew fourteen horses to very good betting race\nA big field at key inland really solid really classy racing\nI should add that Jay through the all states pick for in there with the Senate need a full court that he's got today and of course there'll graph has a key inland full court and best bets and they they dropped that one yesterday so off to a good start there so really good racing miss sunset is back there and re seven for Jeff bondi she's run really well ... twice before\nIt's a big race creed to\nPhilly mirror sprint type race um there's another mild her phrase for Phillies marriage with three Chad Brown's in there and there's a a tour sprint kick it off Rogers going to talk about so just a tremendous car a couple of great made in races came in today probably the best racing in the country um next up Belmont\nThey have four consecutive stakes races including the champagne for two year olds\nThey held prints for three year olds on the grass the belle Dame\nNot the greatest building a but we'll see a couple of these go to the Breeders' Cup to staff\nAnd then the turf sprint kicks it off with disco partner want a balanced ... courses so really good racing at Belmont Jay's going to mention the champagne Rogers going to talk about the he'll print so I'll leave that to those guys and I'm really really high quality and competitive racing the champagne very competitive\nUm the turf sprint very competitive ... it's just it's on today you got to be prepared tremendous amount of action and about a three hour period starting it around a twelve thirty California time\nAnd are going until about three thirty there are stakes every Fifteen minutes somewhere so be prepared today be ready um will help you out as much as we possibly ... fun and make some money\nIn a excuse me\nSo much going on uh what else I mentioned the arc de Triomphe oh yeah it's a three day weekend of racing so thanks to Columbus Day which is on Monday there is Monday racing everywhere so no that that's happening if you get that day off good for you\nEnjoy it and a good data play dollar beers at Santa Anita and two dollar hot dogs so there you go another reason to go to the great race place so tremendous action everywhere I'm excited we're going to see a whole bunch of horses a step up to the Breeders' Cup or step off\nAnd be knocked out of the running um\nSo this is a good scouting day and hopefully a day to make some money especially I think it came lent um and the Belmont with the full field some some real real good opportunities there uh I like a horse in the seventh race it ... not going to be a huge price but I think a golden mischief\nIt's going to win the T ca that to fill in mirror dirt sprint over miss sunset\nGolden mischief in re seven or eight keen land which probably give you the number of that but I'll do that in the second one to throw one out there there's so much action going on you gotta take your shot when you can um but anyway I think we should probably bring Steve on and just get to it let's do that and see their\nArea I Am here jeeze\nYeah listening in pretty big day to day huh pretty fun\nMy goodness if you're a strict monster a monster gray everywhere a boy oh boy seeming just could not be\nActivities fields very very very competitive ... fields a great great ... great we have to Oman and you know what race car fan and I think that's a tremendous Carter than I mean I spent forever on guard\nAnd boy there's going to be some big crowds today there's like a big fires are going to pay very well and if you could string character that you will be rewarded\nYes I agree with that I I thought it was kind of agree kind of an under the radar under the radar really good card at Santa Anita last week look like the better card but there are a lot of big favorites that you know did what they were supposed to do and that that makes it a little tough to make money\nUm today a little different today's top to bottom really solid what do you think about them starting it off with a nice a turf allowance and the first race I loved\nWas great race for straights that does raise a glass or rather given that race a bigger step on the air raid\n... last week I had a real hard time finding a race to do further for the for the show today I really had five or six that I could have chose problem and I and I ended up on race number nine but I think it's a great\nI think that's a great situation today for the players um panic and you know at least a hundred horses today I Would think are probably going to re Robyn I'm In the ... so that this was a huge huge prep day and uh you know all over the place and a big fan of need to have great card as well\nNo no I I I agree so it before we get to your play readers can we did not talk about this I'm just throwing this out there but you know the horses Breeders' Cup future bet is there somebody you're thinking of that if you got a price you'd make a play this weekend were or as you still in kind of wait and see mode\nInteresting I've always been kind of a wait and see kind of guy I'm I'll tell you what there was a race that was run yesterday at Kean Lynn and ah they run this ah this the Knicks at every year and it's usually a race where where you can see a contender now live between liberal\nHad more trouble than five horse\nField and you can possibly imagine J so\nAnd uh I'll tell you what their source I Believe there is now six or eight or seven for nine I was trying to go through my mind at Churchill Downs\nSo a horse that may get some action on the day of the race but I Wonder what you can get a limousine liberal or a future book right now I I Would take a look at that horse Jason or an absolute track whatever he's an old boy\nAnd a tell you what he really really when he won and earlier this year at Churchill Downs a for the six or seven time I thought boy the here's really attract whatever\nThen he went to New York in the Atlantic side there and uh and yesterday again in extremely troubled third two times checking in five or ... I Believe he would have won yesterday\nYeah that's one of those when you're the owner and you see the fly force field and you watch that trip he you know that that that's just a gut punch like come on don't find that much of\nIt happens um and sometimes in the smaller field you know it it's weird but you can\nYou know it's hard to find the right spot there but that that was tough the winner of the race was promises fulfilled who is pretty game coming down the lame but I tell you the Breeders' Cup spread this year is going to be pretty strong are there are some really fast horses\nComing in and very good for him and we have two of them at least two of them were going to see in the sprint today Roy each and rent some the moon opinion there\nI don't think either one of those horses are ready to go to the ... they were last year actually I think brands on the moon is where he was last year which to me is a couple of steps below the best and\nUm I mean boy it's a big challenge for Peter Miller make any get this horse racing today to me a really it's really look sluggish last time I think he finished fourth in that race I had\nEverybody have a great day out there and I can't wait to talk to your next week\nAll right you got its deep pollock doing this thing's guy's best bets full card from Santa Anita ready to roll I'm On the race and Jason dot com and also on the phone line eight seven seven nine five one six one six Steve is on line three\nAll right we're going to take a first break we got Roger new Bauer queued up he's got three races force a\nCaitlin Belmont Santa Anita\nGets music from Nineteen Seventy four forty a today check it out right back [noise]\nS C\nBack a little steely Dan little Santana [noise]\nFeel good [noise] Santana still plan still working and so steely Dan we plan to New York for I think ten days I Know my man steep Christ is going to\nGo is all time favorite ... All right\nWe are back back focused on racing and have you heard the neighbor that spot there a quick mentioned for ... you're going to play those ... Breeders' Cup future waiters or which closed tomorrow at three o'clock Pacific\nUm you get ten times the points on that some you bet fifty dollars on horse you get five hundred points in points turned into money so a little bit of a nice bonus they're also if you want to bet the champagne today through ... it's race ten or ... going to talk about it those are the two year olds so pretty wide open race if you place twenty dollars in ...\nOn that race they are going to kick you back ten dollars to play in the Breeders' Cup\nSo there you go and do you get another bank road builder uh tomorrow in the grade one present so a lot of options to ah get what is essentially free money and I have a pet\nAnd of course you can still get to sign up on as you use the code Jason two hundred you haven't done that already get ready for the Breeders' Cup rock and roll and you have a you get an extra two hundred to play and that's the day to use it\nUh so they have it All right um I mentioned the the nice score should have been a huge score but instead it was just a great score yesterday at the ...\nAnd also a couple of really nice course at Santa Anita Fifteen dollar best bet to close the show yesterday and a Seventeen dollar best bet to close the show on Thursday I'm so coming in with some nice momentum slips bring on a send your new power Roger good morning\nIt's MORNING to you and how are you good not used to being called send your I take it [laughter]\nAll right I Gotcha that was good um yeah it's a it's a fun time of year are you guys have had some nice a nice hits especially that was that was pretty sweet yesterday getting that horse to go where the wire Mitchell moral the writer bird's nest party very capable did what he needed to do there\nAnd um we got some big action today came lent Belmont and Santa Anita more work more fun work and ah let's have added huh\nYeah it is a lot of fun book dealt with Belmont a rape nine to ...\nUh my hundred and eighty three year old just got a little bit easier to talk about a writer ... what other what we got a great day do the work we're looking at here at number to prioritize\nIt to one morning line yeah ... is a very nice pattern moving forward but were they were\nA who will you get ...\nGetting all pointing we getting four pounds or from the paper raging bull and to get a good night in tight trips but the combination white side trip at a night clicking pattern moving forward a pain to one probably be a little less than that now but even at ... or\nA fucking quite at will walk with number three raging bull a fixed pie paper\nRight Chad brown six to five on the turf okay never heard that but you know you got to do it together but um unbelievable I mean if you have a decent tour force in New York you send them to jab right and I guess he says yes right he just takes them out you know\nUm he does have some very wealthy on her so maybe he wouldn't take it if I send them one but um I don't know the horse was quality probably would uh again we're talking about race nineties or three year olds\nOn the grass going a mile in eight and that we've seen how important saving ground can be a in these in these type of races and I think that's the trip you hope to expecting Dylan Davis has turned into a very solid journeyman writer and he writes the to prioritize he he knows what he's supposed to do he reads the foreman and very very capable dissent Robin Davis right\nYeah yeah it was very well\nAnd uh he's written this worse last two times has a winning a third ah and again we're talking about race nine the hill prince nice pattern nice price or on the to prioritize and get in a box with the favorite ...\nThe French bread raging bull comes off a wind and the great three Sarah knack for chat brown a again that's race nine I'm very nice card at Belmont a four consecutive steaks there the hill prince is the third of those since followed by the champagne 'em and you want to jump from there to\n... ... All right let's\nDo it and you're going to talk about race ...\n... and this was this was a decision and we talked about every ... trying to decide what race to do an absolutely great card of a victory for the great\nYeah the ... these are loaded five straight steaks and uh you know everybody wants to run opening weekend it came on just one of those things back there where if you got a horse anywhere near ready for one of these races they're geared up an enrolling everybody wants to be there and be seen and when one of these great steaks and send themselves maybe the Breeders' Cup but at least when a big snakes a key inland\nVery prestigious so a lot of full feels a lot of action here ... and this is the five and a half for long\nTerm sprint the Woodford\nAh it's always a good one and it it was pretty good this year too\nYes it is we're we're going to focus on number eight unwrap it one more time with the war at a very number ... ...\nBefore that was offered a job but I Would want without basics\nSo uh we're going to be going back to that big number at the end of last year\nAnd a attend to one uh it'd be works out a trip that just seems to be the right place in this race but there are there are plenty of options um as I could focus will be women or a ... on a graph that number eight\nWe're going to use the number who uh who Cheryl rented to last time out a better to get back to a in his past performance just\nAnd number three could perfect it came to one got down to what you want a quarter earlier this year a has plenty of time on this race today and picked up Santana today who had been writing very well or as well\nSo eight with two three that's to play here\nThey go in and a box with the three or we're going to box to create\nYeah and there's some prices the eight hundred after this tend to one\nOr two ... five to one and kid perfect uh three uh is with underrated rider Ricardo Santana junior is Fifteen to one and for folks that don't remember he's been around for a while you should use an eight year old now and crafted\nAnd it's the worst it's owned in part by a Wesley wealth or a football player with why he named horse on drafted 'cause he went on draft and uh\nAnd himself quite a career I'm playing with that Brady character and uh they send the source overseas you know didn't run well last time but boy he's had quite a career he's earned a million and a half dollars\nAnd has had some success it came on the last time he was a key England was a while back you won a five and a half for a long term sprint so very very capable and like you said to be cycling back had to prep a Kentucky Downs and\nAnd kind of looking good coming in here a little bit under the radar I think is an eight year old hasn't won a since last year so\nThis could be a good time to get them to eat on drafted\nWith the two and three and again this kicks off five consecutive stakes races they do have a special\nUh pick five all states pick five fifty cent pick five here uh at Kean land and a tremendous action back there so I'm drafted with ... in ... perfect to kick it off a ...\nAnd let's finally go to California and like I mentioned they have a very nice race to kick off the card and you're going to talk about it\nRight the very end I pick off the ... the\nTurk allowing sources um it looks like around four to win this race and there's a couple of prices here that could\nThat can do that and the first one is forever would need to do what need to go for a at twelve to one morning line just want to have the ability to run for or better and it's getting seven pounds for every a major player in the race yup\nSo you're getting seven pounds you're going to get an inside trip you have the ability to run for better and better twelve to one morning line so that all those things together and make this one a a very solid clay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Inside Racing", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "06"}
