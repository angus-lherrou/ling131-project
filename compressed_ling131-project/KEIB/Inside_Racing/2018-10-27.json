current situation\nAgain if you're a coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and coaster Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard\nAnd she did and and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before or after golf she goes oh before of course and I love that of course\nWe're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection

back next week and look forward to speaking with you again but between now and then mail your trade bickering\n[noise]\nThe preceding program was provided for entertainment and generally informational purposes opinions express were those are the present are only\nAnyway the classic closes things out you can figure out exactly one post I'm as for that accelerate west coast McKinsey all three of whom work this morning at Santa Anita so keep an eye on that I don't have any info yet but all three work this morning their final work I mentioned mind your biscuits Mendelssohn ... worked yesterday work will thunder\nSnow is working well Catholic Boy and yo cheetah\nAlso coming in strong are going to hurt the dirt and speaking of turf the dirt roaring lions I mentioned this last week on the show he won an ask Scott as we were doing the show\nThis is a brilliant three year old who's won four straight grade one races or group one race is over in Europe for John ... and they're going to bring him over and run them in the classic\nAnd that's going to be huge if he takes the dirt and he is kind of bread for it watch out a so roaring lions as a whole another layer to the Breeders' Cup classic and here's something to remember for Breeders' Cup this is an overall no okay\nTurf forces or horses with turf breeding or perform tend to take to the Churchill dirt\nBetter than almost any other major dirt racetrack\nJust nobody really knows why but it happens and it happens regularly\nAnd we saw what happened with Catholic Boy ... when they went to the dirt I'm just saying roaring lion watch how man this is a extremely serious racehorse\nA in John gods and is one of the best trainers of all time so he is in the classic and a man that is going to be some horse race wow a lot of different ways to go there I'm Breeders' Cup friday a quick mention\nBreeders' Cup friday is all two year olds so be prepared the turf sprint for two year olds kick things off of that will be at twelve twenty California time on friday twelve twenty first of five Breeders' Cup two year old races next friday followed by the juvenile Phillies turf\nThen the juvenile Phillies\nThan the juvenile turf\nAnd then finally the juvenile which ah should feature a pretty cool ah east west match up game winner for Bob effort complexity for Chad brown ... throwing a match for the juvenile that's going to be a price that could sneak in and that is well defined\nFor trainer Kathleen McConnell out of Florida well defined do not sleep on that horse hitting the board may be coming in the exact maybe the tri well defined I'm actually going to use that horse in my pick for his he could blow up the whole thing up so there's one to watch\nUh an in the juvenile Phillies turf newspaper of record for Chad brown has been so impressive I Know the Europeans are going to be tough in there but newspaper of record for Jeb brown\nTwo for two has not been challenged Chad browse won this race a few times already I think newspaper of record could be a single Breeders' Cup friday in the juvenile Phillies turf that does kickoff delete pick for\nA Breeders' Cup pick for on friday so it's\nDefinitely wanted to watch not going to get a big price on her or maybe there'll be some Europeans but uh she's going to be very very tough so really looking forward to Breeders' Cup friday they made it all about the ... okay fine I'm On it [laughter] let's do it the juvenile facility should be great that's below the enough from the west coast for salmon Callahan who slipped brilliant\nA against J walk a horse that one in New York restless writer who want impressively keen land in Syrian Getty emperors was also coming in looking very very strong I think those for stand out in the juvenile Phillies those are the four I'm going to use\nI don't think I'm going to go deeper than that now in the juvenile Phillies on friday and not sure who I like best of those for you but I think those four standout so that's what's happening on friday\nAnd Saturday like I said nine Breeders' Cup races starting pretty early in the morning so we're going to have all our work done you should have your plans made and and be ready to roll as it's an early one if you're on the west coast if you're not hey enjoy\nI'm All right so we're gonna bring on a let's see hold on a sec yeah we're going to bring on Mr pollock right now let's see how he's doing Steve good morning\nGood morning Jason how you doing\nI'm so excited I'm ready for Breeders' Cup now\nThat we need to get the Dodgers game last night I did but I I didn't make it I made it through Seventeen innings and it turns out in the ... the I needed to go one more I had a at a radio show to do in the morning so I decided you know what could this could go on all night I mean nobody was everybody was looking to\nYou know Jack one out of the park and finally max months he did good for him so um but now I'm ready for the\nBreeders' Cup let's let's get this there's good racing this weekend but let's get it over with my focus has shifted I'll be out what it\nWas Breeders' Cup if you're going to be gay and Breeders' Cup Saturday paths at the\nVery end mayor race which the phenomenal race ... and its own and we're seeing a from a betting standpoint as good a betting card that is going to be as anyone we've ever had because of the ... the switch and because\nThey're just all the dominant horses have some questions all of them yeah\nI like it was about it I mean I'm\nProbably the or the Breeders' Cup or we're going to see the shortest price horse but yes you know unable has one we are twice in a row but no horses wanting aren't coming over here now right they don't have to face manila reactor quote unquote Shannon great communicator horses are great Americans or the ... because\nIt just seems like we've sort of left that division at camp ground and I don't think he's got a really strong in the ambulance race so you know it seems to me that\nWould enable gonna have to do to win this race is beat the same ... that you've been beating because our biggest competition to me is going to come from the European in that race\nI agree I'll throw a name out there for folks walled guys is a horse that ran I Believe fourth in the arts are trained by Andre fob who did it last year has done it many many times one of the greatest trainers of all time greatest top ten turf trainers ever a missile horse it's a very serious runner he'll be in there [noise]\nUm yeah I agree she's got to beat the euro's and remember\nYou know she's had a short year that was all your second race so she's not you know thoroughly race is third off to lay off but\nAgain for whatever reason no or winter has ever won the turf some that finished you know second or worse than New York I Want it but ... winter so enable will be the shortest price I think of the day uh she'll probably be sixty five Seventy five and deservedly so\nUh but you know what again no luck I'm going a mile and a half on a different type of course and we'll see what the weather's like back there too but hey before we keep going I got I mentioned the folks you and I talked about it you're going to we're bringing back the big boy\nPeople who've been around for a while listening to the show remember but you're going to do the big boy package for Breeders' Cup Saturday only and uh for folks that are not familiar that is the full court\nPlus all the way during all the tries supers pick three pick for pick five picks six\nOr you're going to put it all down there for folks that want to go big right that are going to put some money in and really want to play or want to know how deep you're going to go and individual races and then string races together that's a big boy\nSame selections Jason I'm not going to give the different forces out on on on a different line that have not what this is all about is all about it is for people that really want to add a little bit of extra have a bigger bank roll and you won't be able to put together a pick for pick five but maybe somebody else with the smaller bankroll couldn't put\nI couldn't put out maybe putting together a three or four hundred dollars to perfect there and and that stuff that I've been doing a for years and years and I will\nBe putting that on the line and ah you know a much much bigger pick five and ... and even ... freeze on the line we're we're maybe there's a particular race but I think it's\nIt's so wide open that maybe it will even by or race or to\n... or something that I don't like to do on a on the on the regular line because most people have a a little bit of a letter to the bank roll but there are a Brett betting the Breeders' Cup and having a bigger bank roll it that they could damage there's no question about it because you'll be able to cover things\nAbout other people just strictly won't be able to cover yeah and that's what we're going to be doing on the sly\nYeah and uh you mentioned super factors that's obviously a key for you always has been and that'll be there on the big boy line as well so going deep into individual races as well as string and racist together so that option will be available to folks\nAt racing Jason dot com or the regular phone card will be there so the what your full card for church or for that day they'll get a but if they want the big boy option that's going to be there to uh the price is going to be fifty dollars\nAs opposed to the twenty five for the full card had a lot of success this in the past and ah this was the time to bring it back out if there's ever been a big boy card it's next Saturday So\nNo question about yeah about about it I've gotten\nA lot of the handicap and out of the way that draws gonna be gigantic ... I think everybody's racist are really going to be big especially if we see some moisture in the track folks one thing that we have noticed over the years I'm doing a lot of ... and a lot of Breeders' Cup fair the more moisture you get closer to the rail that you want to be\nI I really believe that's going to be a key and I think that's something that I can tell the folks keep an eye on that we did have a a\n... I think it was about Thirteen or fourteen years ago we had a Breeders' Cup of Churchill\nThat the rail was gold and you could just throw the rest of it out and you could just handicap one two three\nUm I remember Doug O'Neill wanting a sprint course from the wonderful with according to ... I paid a gigantic number and by then you could just tell the inside was golden and it just continued on throughout the day and I and I still think the Breeders' Cup classic I don't know that that's where you want to draw inside there if it's moist because\nBox running in my mind I thought it was the Philly ... phrase to one but it was ... was\n... it was squirrels squirt a back in New York I was there it was funny um and uh Yeah David land that might be listening and if he is he's he's smiling right now for sure straight guy and uh yeah that was pretty funny All right let's get to today are let's jump in and do want some Santa Anita\nCase and don't forget about that pick fix today boy there's eight hundred and Seventeen thousand dollars in that part the pictures and paying very well every day for the amount of money that's bet on it in\nAnd I'll tell you what today it could be a big pay here and it's not impossible that somebody could take it out today if a couple of these twenty the ones that looked like they have a chance can and I could come through there are a couple of horses\nEpic prices that I think you have a chance we're going to celebrate today Jason I'm going to give you what I thought was the best course though that I watched last night and the seven ... number for horses name is ... ... ... a three year old Philly that actually\nTwo races back ah she ran against a very very nice portion crew royalty\nAlso or just grazing ah from the pill tomato barn a very nice for some air and did not run or best race don't want to turn I Love the fact that she was cutting back last time she had actually come out of a couple of races in a row\nAnd she was going to win last time in my eyes there's no question that just says lack room and the racing or Rosario had given her a perfect trip\nAnd she got a fast pace in front of her and she was supposed to win and she ... cold and she really really didn't run to the last couple of hundred yards\nRosario just wrapped up are you just got stopped and you know when you when you try to save all the ground sometimes you just don't get through throughout the day it looks to me like she's going to get a very very similar set up and she's got a lot of course there's\nA something that I often right down in the form I Do not like she horses go from five for a long\nTo seven for a long or five and a half for longs for seven for a long I think it's so difficult it's already difficult enough enough to go from six belongs to seven prolonged but when you go five five and a half which what forces like\nA chatty Cathy late and laughed because it was another one that's going from five for a long when you do that it's just extremely difficult and I think\nWith a horse on the far I'm trying to you know shoot conquests louder ... from the rail and then these horses that I'm Talking about it at our five ... horses trying to go shopping for a long time and they're all speak horses yeah should be able to sit back at the back of the field and make a run with the space horses or in front of them\nI'm a little bit concerned with Gary Mandela he's really really struggled but this horse is really going good guns are great convictions say and letting the horses but she faced before much much tougher competition and her racist two and three back\nI think these are the right level for her and I think she gets the pace to ban back takes over so for me it's number or structure I'm going to play or well to when I'm going to use to find time for heavy board is this for skipping class really been facing horses like a like next time set\nLike phantom proton anti friday anonymity all these forces Mali's freedom or running in the ... uh next week so time for every really get to break in here I think she'll be able to handle the distance and she should make a late Ron so I'm going to use her\nAnd I'll use conquest flatter me doesn't seem quite as good as she was three or four racers back maybe she could turn it back around but she's going to have some ... pressure to deal with I think she's still going to be if she can\nDuke it out with these them hang around but I like the force structure it's gonna be might win back here will use the five ... being a couple of crack boxers\nAlright again this is ray seven today on a very nice card at Santa Anita before ...\nWith the five and six and I will remind folks that are you hit the\nReally pick ordinarily pick five or last Saturday people use your horses that pick five came back almost four hundred dollars at a bunch of pick threes and then Sunday dropped the free play on folks for the second week and Roebuck he's picked paid a nice fourteen sixty that was pretty sweet a that was a nice price ... and then this week\nIn the late pick for on Thursday and how to try to paint almost what three hundred dollars right to eighty eight or two eighty nine I Gotcha for\nHim and I kept ... ...\nYeah so that was a those are nice two hundred and eighty eight yeah actually the\nThird rapid breathing information and that there are a ... second to none no doubt about it I use their numbers but the fact that they give the numbers of the offspring versus just the record so the offspring ... you know if a horse strict time when a room with running to Canterbury and running thirteenth fourteenth on the sheets\nVersus a horse that wasn't a big time winner but was running restrictions through famine for maybe one or two or three races you're just looking at the record of the horses can't look at the record of the horses handicap horses and do well we got to look at the numbers of bachelor thorough graph give that breeding information is invaluable and and and thanks to them that trifecta no doubt\nThere we go I was a very nice ... on Thursday so let's have a big weekend here and uh then we got Breeders' Cup friday and big boy Breeders' Cup Saturday we are ready to roll Steve appreciate it have a great one today and when we talk to you next week it will be Breeders' Cup thing\nRight everybody have a great great day out there and Joe yourself and don't forget about putting a fix fix ticket and today pokes you all got shot twenty
