{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Seem to add trading into their life I mean you know the thing I always like to say there's only twenty four hours a day and right now are using all of them the other thing I Would like to bring up is every time I see a movie on trading or TV show on trading are investing they always show somebody sweating profusely in front of Eighteen different monitors taking hypertension medication\nWhen in reality the thing that I Love so much about this and I was even telling my class last night a brand new set of students that are just coming out with on on the trading ketamine is is when you're doing everything's pro active when you're proactively investing you're able to be strategic you're able to be logical you're able to be rational and you're able to set things up ahead of time proactive\nThe average kind of trader investor out there is more reactive something happens and they react to it which keeps them in an emotional state and the lesson last night with the class was was all about kind of the mental makeup that we need to have for to to really have consistent income in the market and it's all about being proactive rather than reactive and I also think\nThat that is a point to bring up in this conversation because the pro active side of it is what allows your lifestyle to be whatever you want your lifestyle to be right it's something where you can schedule the market around you rather than schedule in your life around the market\nYou know look Albert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes ever about insanity and you know step finish them insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome most people\nLive in a very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade\nIs they read a book or go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching well I can tell you what's amazing\nThat what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time is the only profession you can do this\nTrading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is a simplify trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam ... this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just the transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd I think that's an important concept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our county right what happens is there's a buyer and seller\nThere's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are a conduit to just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do there well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks show up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and a lot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now with jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially with a correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again everyone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something in the two biggest ones we hear what I'm going to lose weight this year they came out of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money\nBut the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing somewhere else too but I'm going to give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed all plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan\nThat step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because any and we are we going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick and all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions that I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks\nEighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed plan they didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow\nAnd the only attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time\nThat putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goal we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is I don't want to have their classes and we've got this stack the deck at tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left would you give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really live that life that you won't get your money making money in and I was like to say whether you've got two dollars or two million dollars you'd be able to see exactly what it takes to get that money generating that income that can really sustain that lifestyle that you deserve now include with your passes it's gonna be a professional insiders ticket and this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kid makes it so you can get started right now\n... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three that's eight seven seven nine four to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWere some of the other things you guys are working on right now as far as your instructor team to really help people take control their lifestyle help people do the things they want to do\nTo help them get over procrastination Ryan I mean it's amazing how many people spent so much time watching TV procrastinating\nComing up with a reason why they can't do something and what have you only need it to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now he's a procrastinating of watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money so I asked you to solve the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you can quit your job or if you could spend more time with your family a lot of our students now are starting to actually\nMake money while they're on vacations I have June one of my students recently and she sent me a postcard from Costa Rica and she said it's great I'm playing golf is has been my dream but I'm also trading on the trip and of course when she came back I asked you trade before after and she went\nBefore of course so she'd get up early in the morning because the one thing about having an education and being able to trade it any time with an Internet connection that computer is there are several markets to trade it's twenty four hour marketplace right now so the rules have changed and people are finding that they can take back their lives\nAnd actually start doing some of the things they want to do as opposed to working for someone else which is what is the required to do of themselves\nYeah there was a there was a book I read a little while ago called the world is flat and it talked about a lot of outsourcing in a different kind of business strategies but it talks a lot about technology and how technology has really kind of level are made this playing field\nA very level and it makes ah it makes it difficult on some businesses to be competitive and it makes it easier on other businesses to get going and that's very true inside of the markets because\nWith the with the Internet connections that we have what the data streams that we have\nIt really is this this this marketplace where it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter where you from it doesn't matter even how much money really you're getting started with everybody has access to the same information inside of the markets and so it doesn't matter where we come from it only matters where we're going and that we stay focused\nKind of on that go hand in that we do everything necessary to accomplish it and that's kind of that great it's that great relief point where you you get to a point in life or you go you know what I can do whatever\nA hasn't won this year um but it's only a second race back to Dubai\nAnd he's going to step down to five for long because that's where they're going to do it at the Breeders' Cup and again still pretty weird to see five for a long tour phrases Santa needed but we're going to see more of them so here here's another one used to be six and a half they cut it back to five so\nIt's a full out turf sprint five for lungs what we were used to seeing a Hollywood park does not need a\nBall park is no more it's going\nSo ah nine race card at Sandy today again going to be a beautiful day out there I'm In uh\nCalifornia flag goes as race five for turf races today it was fun I'll take that\nUm [noise] and uh we had east from Santa Anita ended up at Kean land or very nice card with the feature being the raven run for a three year old Phillies going seven for longs they have a full field they're fulfilled most of the day came one great way during a great opportunities there the follow me ... and it's just a\nIt's a beautiful thing and I know I say this every year but uh for those that have been back there\nAnd done the farm tours and done the whole key inland experience it is unique in American Racing and or just give me a chance to remind you next year in the spring or fall think about making plans to go back there if you've got three or four days do it it is a\nYou know people at the farms are tremendous especially if you set it up beforehand but a lot of them you can just show up and they'll give you the tour you can see the stallions you can see the barns\nAnd just the whole area is all about the horse and it's like new marketing and in England\nIt is just a few love racing you got to go and if you haven't been pushing you to think about it for next next spring in next fall or you could see the schedules are already out so you know the dates and go do make it happen to yourself a safer you will never forget your time back there also you can go to old friends form now\nThat's where silver charm is and you know forty other great thoroughbred champions one of the best things has been done in recent years a guy named Michael blowing has been on the show I'm old friends is is a great stopped as well a lot of horses you watched over the years in some of your favorites or they're\nAnd they're all about bringing out and bringing the horses out and having you see 'em and experienced that whole deal so\nIt's a it's a fun fun think England and uh and then of course the racetrack itself is amazing and boy they like to party back there so if you're a person likes to have a good time to track\nAnd you'd think del mar is it no [laughter] ... a little bit different kind of a party but man they get after factor whew\nSo just throwing that out there so they run into ... um today good card and again Belmont really nice card New York bread sticks day we're not going to see the best New York bread that's mind your biscuits there's some good ones now they put the money and thanks to the casinos back there in New York readings just taken off\nOr we're going to see a few of them in the Breeders' Cup including mind you biscuits he's not running today 'cause he's going to be run into the big big money\nAlthough they have not decided what race mind your biscuits is going to go in\nMaybe the classic maybe the dirt mile and they're still actually thinking maybe I don't want it in the sprint\nOr if the race comes up with a bunch of speed and they think they can nail to speed late so\nWe'll see what happens with mind biscuits they're going to wait a while he had a good workout everything is good uh I'd like to see him in the classic I think he's got to an outside shot there and like to see him try mile and a quarter or the dirt miles confer pretty good season there wow that becomes a very serious race so\nEither way would be fun to see him he is a really nice racehorse mind your biscuits\nAnd versatile which we like to see kind of like the late great forego one of my all time favorites All right um do we have Steve\nWe do let's bring 'em on Steve good morning\nOr good morning Jason what a what a great place to start with mind your ... huge huge decision for everybody and which will wear that horse goes\nBoy the mild just with his camera right between the eyes I think that's the perfect as there was for him I Know they're going to be tempted to to run in the classic at a mile and a quarter I I make his cancer about\nMaybe thirty percent as good as I Would in a mile I really think that horses a strong chance of a mile and I'm not so sure that there's enough speed and the sprint I I don't know it seems to me I mean I I don't care where they go um but to me their best chance would be in the mile\nYeah I agree and and he has a fan it's about a mile that features mind your biscuits city of light forensic fire and Catalina cruiser [laughter] I mean that that would be a serious\nHorse race that is a series of course race absolutely\nYeah so yeah either go either way and if he shows up in the classic he definitely adds some spice to what is a really wide open classic especially if you're not a huge accelerate fan or think maybe he's not as his peek\nA it is a a wide open race this year and he would you know he would again be a a little bit of an outside contender but a contender um especially because he ran such a nice race at Churchill last time\nUm and showed he has an affinity for that track so um yeah big decision coming there he's looking at the at the other scratches the trainer and says you know he's going to see how it plays out so [noise]\nSo we'll see um other breeders cup thoughts I Know you've been looking and are doing some work already in there and are ready even though it's two weeks away so\nYeah I have been Jason or just because the the the ah the injuries came out already I was able to print outs are all the races and I've been able to go back and watch the tape I mean you really got to have some time it takes a lot of time to watch you know to watch some of these forces\nUm you know I was able to watch a horse named fine needle find\nNeedles going to run in the in the Breeders' Cup\nTurks sprint race [noise] never Japanese\nRunner and I will tell you what folks there's forces off the charts on tape out if there's sources and now there's going to be some race because\nGets the layout of apply for a long race it is such a race to have trouble and I we saw the au yeah to Philly last year that was the big big favorite name she's got professional she never even got a chance to pick pick her feet up and she went off it two or three to five and that race there never ran a step so horse like fine needle is\nIs definitely a an extremely talented runner I don't know what price she'll be because I\nThink we've only seen one Japanese runner winning a ... mile a few years back but this horse fine needle can really run and we noticed co partnering a world record holder in New York cameras horse run outside of New York\nUh mainly got Peter Miller who's just been off the charts on how you spend in ... and ... my time as many as four in that race and all that kind of just be an absolutely tremendous tremendous race\nYeah fine needle alright the Japanese force I was just in Japan this week so I have a little Japan on the mind so pretty good interesting karma that you bring up a Japanese words out of all the worst is bringing up so they love\nThat one really caught my eye Jason I mean enable it's pretty obvious to get your eye and you know when I started to watch enable run on tape and folks just sources running into Breeders' Cup mile and a half turf and I'm just holding my breath open the horse comments but\nWhen I see the quality that we have here in Southern California go down and down and down and the horse that representing started to California\nI get there is going to be one and then what what I feed back east I feed her representation of this country going down and down and that level of at mile and a half to earthquakes and I fear Philly like enable coming over who's one of the art not once\nBut two years in a row beating Eighteen Seventeen now their horses I have an amazing trainer and John God's will and will probably have superstar writer prank you tore I Am the Arabs it's a it's a pretty\nScary proposition for the American horses cows mad at Grand against the naval base and lost like Thirteen language and ... came over here and dumped all the American horses\nAre in including a pretty solid be cheaper chat brown and I'm not sure we have a beach or share of the country because they've been kind of alternating how good the linguistic grass races back it\nAnd pay them back at Saratoga and and a boy oh boy we are going to be in a very very deep water if you're if you're sort of some sometimes I'm rooting for like Ryder Cup where you root for the American heart to people well or the face of late ...\nThe Europeans have been dominating the at the mile and a half to brace and it looks worse this year for short may be the worst I've ever seen\nYeah well and on top of that in a in a very rare you know it's very rare but enable was injured and this is third off the layoff for her and they they said for the arc she's not a hundred percent you know but they think she's good enough to get the job done she did by ahead or she should be better now so that's even scarier you feel\nYou're going to be good enough to beat Eighteen now their horses you know race where you just I mean that that's an amazing Philly right there and eat well she is all you are a Philly running against the boys feel you're so good yeah she's not quite a hundred percent but we can be these other Seventeen anymore says that that's incredible\nYeah well she is that good [laughter] and he and he knows that and so they took the shot so she should be better which is good I mean you know then she's it's it's automatic so uh we'll see but she is coming that they've announced it so um that is happening I'm from\nEurope that have been very close to her in that race also so I wouldn't just white clam the race jewelry yet\nKnow we'll see who else come yeah I'm see who else comes from over there they could run one two or one two three the Europeans they've\nDone I think we're running one two three in that race Jason I I agree I don't see a\nYou know cat Brown's pretty good so I I don't want to throw all his forces out he's been absolutely sensational and [noise]\nAnd uh you know hey we got to step it up here in this country I think it's going to be the only trainer it's going to have a horse is ever going to be eligible to run and meet the needs for prices and when a let's get it going we we got the capability to do it we dominated these races for years and then now it's completely on the other side of\nAnd here they are so it's a fresh face that I think is looking to run for re so I think you get and I really like the last race I think your finger position throughout seven to two and a short feel I'm going to take it\nTo try to beat tribal let's face and I don't like the way the re set up for him down on the rail yeah I'm going to use Richard boy and I think brand or the bartender at twelve to one will be rolling here late\nI I like the vine ... at seven to two to win this race and we're going to use the for Richard boy and restricts brand or the bartender engagement for those of you hunch their hunch players out there in the fourth race but nine lucky ... to the fifth race ...\n[laughter]\nThere you go you have to go back a few years for leave it to beaver but it's been on reruns I certainly watched my share of it and uh yeah there you go lucky ... there's the double I mean that's very conscious that easy or what\nI mean I Can't believe that that will actually came up I thought oh my God you've gotta be kidding me lucky while he's so ...\nHere it is a boy All right so the California flag race five five for a long and the turf which as we said a few times see very different distance and er Eddie Haskell does like going five for a long on the turf Eddie the horse anyway so the five Eddie Haskell does bring a little bit of an upset\nWith the four Richards boy and the price for the six Brando the bartender for Craig the lousy so the outside horses for you in raise five which closes\nCloses the players pick five and a is part of course of the jackpot six that we were talking about a previously so I think we lost Steve but uh\nWe're good to go Steve is always good to go and you can get his best bet in his full cart racing Jason dot com also on the phone line eight seven seven nine one five one six one six\nFor Mr pollock in a nice to see that he's already doing a lot of the work for the Breeders' Cup that's what you want a you didn't want to know guys putting into time well Steve is absolutely doing that watching tape of probably every horse that runs that day he's going to be on it so\nThat's one of the reasons he does so well in those big days are All right we're going to take a break we come back and got a Mr new ... new are representing third graph doing its thing to be with us followed by Jay freelancer so stick around and you're listening to inside racing an M eleventh [noise]\n\nNo no\nNo\nYeah we're back at the record company you haven't heard of them played them on the show once before a new rock band from LA out for a few years and they deliver man I think they're coming in concerts in to the record company is the name of that band alright we're back\nInside racing on a Saturday we hear every Saturday from seven to eight what Fifteen Years now Fifteen Years what\nOh man All right I'm let's bring Roger Neugebauer on see how he's doing today Roger good morning\nIt's MORNING Jason how are you I'm fine how are you I'm doing well or a big erasing\nYeah big the Belmont Sunday New York bread sticks a day which uh I don't know five years ago and more used to be kind of you know OK kind of interesting\nAnd now man I mean there's some talent in the New York bread circuit and the money is there and we got full feels very competitive races back there so I think it's really turned into quite a day\nIt has your right to later raises the fields or fall and come back and competitive as well which which\nYeah it really does make it nice it's a lot of fun so hum you guys are continuing to do your thing where two weeks away from the Breeders' Cup you start looking now how do you do a U Breeders' Cup preparation you wait for the pre entries or what's your process there\nYeah so I have access to the early a routine part right I think like Steve mentioned uh certainly go through that I Know cheery has been working hard on\nGetting the European numbers a tight and make sure that we're also there do you start going through in dark field but really you know and ... you know exactly which forces Florida where are you just get opinions early on and see if they're ...\nYeah exactly because there is a lot of switching around a lot of double and trees and then you know we've got to see who's where who draws where and then and then you can really dig in and uh luckily they're doing that earlier than ever so\nI think that's a very good thing for the for the players and give everybody their their chance to put in their work for the last four or five days knowing who's going where and then get after it and I'm like we always say only takes one or two on Breeders' Cup days with the with the fields and the prices are going to get so always ...\nYeah you're right about that but this year but it's I agree with you guys as well and the Europeans I mean their second strings are coming over here and just winning races after races so I Can't imagine it would be like on Breeders' Cup day\nYeah they they can go one two one two three semesters races and uh you know we got a price last year which tells many you guys were on that uh I was on it um and that that made for pretty huge day in and you know still able to get eleven twelve to one and that so it's possible it's out there um and uh we'll we'll keep fire and see what happens um\nWhere do we want to begin today\nWe're going to start a rape ate at Belmont a New York for a two year old stakes race\nAnd we're going to go with number one poppies destiny at six to one morning line here under rice for one thing we always look at from a thoroughbred perspective what two year old that early three year olds are prepared numbers because that's generally assigned that a horse is going to go forward\nAnd this one is destiny is not as fast as a couple of other stuff here\nBut the parents' hands are pointing towards a race or they can win this one so we're going to focus on a number one poppies destiny for going to use a Hemingway of number for\nA bank it perceived asked me something who to back ran a a big number and then had some trouble with the gay or in the last race\nAnd finally dug out of favor primary rebel a Larry rebellious just wandering everywhere this year and this one has a beautiful pattern going forward\nA stretching out to a mile today but the key is the key is number one hobbies destiny to women and then we're going to do exactly is trifecta as with the form the Sixers well\nOK and again this is race eight or the the New York bread sticks state New York showcase Davis a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar raise a flat mild one turn for two year olds and a poppies destiny down on the rail is on the last time a ... second in a nice takes race there um and uh\nA retains Mr Kasell on it which is always a plus and Linda rice and freely solid trainer for a long time now very good with young horses um and that is one costs three hundred thousand so they're looking to get a big return on the investment right now uh the one poppy just the\nThird career race like you said with those that nice pair are looking to move forward year one was for six in race eight and a very nice day at Belmont Park we want to go from Belmont the chemo and\nYeah we're going to go to reach six or five and a half for a long allowance race on the ... a very competitive race it so I could say that about every race in New York hard on the king one car today actually they're all they're all very competitive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Inside Racing", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "20"}
