{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Ken my wife [noise] thank you\nJack I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years in a been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talked about on this show these are\nThe same ideas we talk about what are the love it and most valued clients were not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]\n\nWithout our beloved and most of your clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is that\nI Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on\nFamilies that are you are doing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility you know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility is is something we don't take lightly and\nOne of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisory fern die before you do okay that would be bad so we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be as strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values a strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are a bad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do\nTherefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with are there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for the for them so that is a culture that is the values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or or or or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that you stand for\nAnd and these are the things that endure over time regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these are the things that endure over this the course of time\nNow one of the things that uh we believe in in terms of managing our clients money is we want we want our clients we want you to grow your money but we want you to keep what you would you built we want you to grow your money with confidence\nAnd so because of that we have a strategy that we call by holding cell and by holding cell means that you don't just buying hold you also sell\nAnd the reason why we do that is because you know you can make tons of money you can invest in you know think of bitcoin for example okay some people invested in bitcoin inside go up to whatever\nAnd then now it's come way way down if you if you bought near the top and it grew and you're thinking look at that I made twenty five percent and then the whole thing last\nThen you could be down you know you've lost money on the deal so you don't have anything until you actually sell it that's when you realize the value that you've created in this investment\nSo therefore what's on paper makes you feel good you think you've got it but really it's it's when you sell it that it actually becomes something that is of value so therefore to protect our clients we have a by holding cell philosophy now\nAren't we have ten core values and I want to share with your core value number three okay which is take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your financial goals now the reason why we say that is because risk is not your friend\nOkay and and taking high risk in the search for high returns is not really your friend\nOkay people who take high risks you know they get lucky and or they'll hit one and then they'll try it again and then they want and they had the cycle of bankruptcy and growth in Pakistan ... so what we tell us what we tell people in fact we say this at our seminars is that if if the goal is to make the highest return possible\nThen here's what I recommend sell all of your investments okay go out just go on the Internet right now sell everything you've got turned it all into cash but in a suitcase and we'll meet up next Tuesday and what we'll do is we'll all get on a bus and we'll go to Las Vegas together okay everybody with our little suitcases full of money\nAnd then when we get to Las Vegas we are going to go to the roulette wheel and we're going to bed at all on red\nOkay we're big bat now if we hit or going to make a ton of money we're going to be one very rich group of people\nBut the problem is it may not be read in which case will be a very poor group of people [laughter] so do you want the highest returns Vegas awaits but somewhere between burying it in the backyard you know in a can and going to Las Vegas in betting at all on red lies how much risk you should take\nAnd our goal philosophically in life and I think your goal in life should be the same thing is take only as much risk as it is necessary to accomplish your goals\n\nYou [laughter] well I Love you back because if you take more risk than is necessary to accomplish their goals what what you're doing their you know the market has a way if you're you're being greedy okay and if you think back to that movie years ago Wall Street with Michael Douglas races greed is good well you know what\nThe stock market has a way of spanking greedy people's bottoms bright red you know you get those red cheeks like a ... you don't want that does not a pretty sight okay you don't want red red cheeks so take only as much risk in your life in your finances in all areas that is that is necessary to accomplish their goals otherwise\nSo we try to push our clients down to the least amount of risk that we can take with their investments and still accomplish their goals\nSo making four percent a year makes you secure financially then you know what that's all we need we're not going to go chasing after ten or Fifteen Percent and the risk that comes with that it's just not worth it\nOn the other hand if you're if we need to make six percent then we'll take a little more risk than we would with somebody who only needs for okay so take only as much risk as it's necessary to accomplish their goals\nOkay so that's our core value number three that I Want to tell you that if you'd like to visit with us if you'd like to talk with one of our financial advisors um or you'd like to go to one of our seminars\nA I encourage you to do that go to our website is money matters dot

Steve Rapaport Fox News thousands of migrants resuming their march toward the U.S Mexico border\nThey busted through Honduras they went through about a mile and now they're trying to Capitol Mexico right now they are north of that river\nCarlos de boost the among today use samples from Saint Paul parole and Columbia just stand in for Native American\nThey canceled even testing Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes out and announces this so she's one\nOne thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian\nOne one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only envy and DNA so he felt the need to do it expanded to include South America when other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because they\nAre very very wary of\nThis the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit engine they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that is\nThe story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any native\nAmerican DNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA\nTest and he wanted to present herb ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate the future debate and\nThat's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he kept that she wouldn't show up as Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this Trump is literally causing these people who lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and fill out the American left and I have\nI have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they may they wish they could do it and go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house in a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of voting\nPatterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships a you even go to a local often like mayor or\nTown councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred\nSeats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot shouldn't we're never going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after\nThe two thousand six need elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand and\nTen the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nFor rock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral process of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blue wave this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look at\nTrump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no real Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today but you're not gonna see widely reported let's see if the [noise]\nProbably would see him be ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand Eighteen this is the CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million\nI used to hasn't I mean it nobody else liked the turtle in our party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely by holding steady in this fine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment of Kevin ... the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's it's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition other Democrats the Democrats are not\nUnified and one of the four of them\nSay they want to be

considered a meltdown\nWhen you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nFind the time so tempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us just DNA did not actually use

to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is pathetic\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton was making a fool of herself each and every ... they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no not was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's under cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband who are soon to be barking on what\nA stadium

Oh yes bill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds at twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage because of course they can't let Trump\nUpstaged them like this I mean if Trump didn't do what they can do it if Trump can do what anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent

weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute to this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't lead with it it was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any\nEvidence for it and they knew that ball Z Ford could not pull this off under pressure\n\nI'm Still shocked at balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was ever partner plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe\nThat uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom

hit or damaged or harmed her yelled at or whatever uh\nAnyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the\nReal objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him\nIf they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and into the twenties then they could get rid of it they failed at that all they did was cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turns of people who are sympathetic to them into Trump's supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching the most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line\nAnd for the purpose of destroying a human being and a wife when there isn't\nAny evidence that one of them are at such a thing but the Democrats didn't care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse than

they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and his little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a a a piece on somebody that\nCan be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this trans Russian or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the\nEarly days of sixty minutes it was all about that and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which

feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode went to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship they not
