know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their\nNext year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's just I all I can say that these are smarter than I Am\nA navy but but I uh\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding his own with\nFour thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump has a bill but Waldor Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective those people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in the sewer yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well\nMy question is what else do they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh\nWell that's exactly right and wound right\nThere that was four in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to

all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nLeaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want the he's he is a a that have come through and he's twisted them a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ... the ...\nI think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was going to be a goner I'm before now\nI I they\nAre so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets I I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him 'cause they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd\nIt it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because of the ... the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected and it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a ... left Saudi Arabia after having met when

I can defend the pictures rush the pictures\nThe one thing that has had legs okay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold\nAnd if you're on the phone to be patient were coming through you ill quick oh this is the soundbite from the Hannity interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that aren't going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew them\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which was the gang naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been rife\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately wants Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that\nOut of their work I don't believe in pure objectively on this process if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just the I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose in the single biggest the electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer a an savannah is Julie ... cohost out there talking to fame Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment fans\nDeserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nYou are not buying into this scenario they'll hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't tell those like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play as only about two or three Democrats the template totally on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through that I see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is Juan ... a stuff and to me this is totally abs and um\nThe Emmy Emmy what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sent him to bite\nI'm just suspicious\nOf of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired\nOutcome out of their work and we know that they know we look at the presidential polls in two thousand sixty eight I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win an old landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\n\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win it Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve and the midterms\nIn two thousand four team and the election of two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrats ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party but\nThen I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen houses gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar well not true if these races are being nationalized by the various\nCandidates him [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats\nHave they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that many people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage an anger there promoting insanity and the lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump\nSentiment in a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is\nDoes the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing is landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went on for like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned Matt\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey haven't dad continued to try and portray America as this unfair on just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest that trend devoting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think different coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve ... who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a\nReason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my point\nIt's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nAnd so from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C living dive bomb\nTheir gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every I don't\nI I wouldn't it be ostracized after not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons so he'll just
