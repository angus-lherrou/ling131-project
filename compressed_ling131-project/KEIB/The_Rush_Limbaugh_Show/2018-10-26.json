the rest of the guy with a van it does look\nLike he is a a a disturbed individual with a lot of a Donald Trump stuff on his van but you know let's wait for information\nYou know we we there were people who said uh on the right false flags they were those on the left that said it was a conservative um we've said the whole time let's wake for information might be a crazy guy and might be and so it was amazing to just say\nI'm a lot of people will make a prediction with no evidence on something like this right they'll say oh it was the right wing or or it was a left where\nAnd then went turns out to be one of those two they claimed victory as if what they did was was a good idea you know it wasn't that not a good idea you know the fact that you come out and you say are you blame the right with no evidence and then it turns out to be someone on the right that doesn't make you we're we're process good right like I say\nI'm Sorry I should I I just [laughter]\nI just read a comment from

is not a bad description none of us bad and what's not\nAnd again it's you know what do you do hear with these things it does at the very least is at least we can hopefully\n... avoid any injury remember there's been literally nothing that's happened with these it's been a big media spectacle but you know ... much less of a media spectacle that what happened when Trump and many others Madison and others in the government received white powder in the mail\nLast week or two weeks ago so you know I obviously we know why it's a bigger\nA bigger deal now number one it was a media member specifically that was targeted in this with CNN getting one of the packages and number two obviously uh the uh the the chance to kind of blame this broadly against the right is going to be something that the media is going to take advantage of it at all possible\nBut we don't know yet and we'll find out from this person to see if they were ... you know how serious the attempt was when we look at the bottom construction will find that out and we always find that you know it's all you want more information quickly but getting the right information and making sure you know what's going on is is always a better choice\nAnd a and let's also remember that we did not condemn Bernie Sanders\nFor the shooter Bernie Sanders was not responsible for that the crazy guy who did it was Mm\nLet's back to ... the same amount of\nWe're talking about debt consolidation on news\nBruce today I'm Larry Morgan did you know the average household nearly Thirteen hundred dollars in credit card interest each year Thirteen hundred interest\nThat doesn't even include the credit card ballots now if this applies to you I Want you to know is really especially if you're a homeowner we're talking with ... cofounder of American ... tell us how can American financing assist people with debt consolidation\nWell Mary credit card carry some of the highest interest rates around\nYou're going to be looking at a Fifteen Percent interest rate which is about triple what a mortgage rate currently is that's why I recommend mortgage refinancing to consolidate that it works like combining multiple back into one came in at a lower interest rate you could say five hundred thousand dollars and learn more and more\nWow so your credit card bills can roll into your mortgage\nYes they can and and your student loans and personal as\nWell that sounds great but doesn't refinancing your mortgage mean you have to start your loan term all over again\nFor some reason they did at that at American than anything we don't have to reset your long term you can get ten Thirteen or ... and then very anytime you need if your mortgage your way\n[noise] um [noise]\nI also have something censor me here said that he was um I'm from Avon the Torah and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party\nBirthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two ah income information pending what does this site can't tell what the site is it it's um [noise] anyway identifies\nIt as a member of the Green Party uh he's got pictures of Trump and he's got GOP stickers all\nOver the of the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that they have the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper worthy recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a\nBlow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this from everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information on what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to\nBelieve the first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy\nIdentifying the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was\nAn angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nAre matters of same thing is happening today with the economic news we have the GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the into predicting three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every day stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the Dr wiser reporting today\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there\nIs this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the\nMidterms nobody talks about this yesterday this was a I bought a left wing media narrative that it that created\nBut apparently Trump to sign on to what President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted\nFrom news about the midterms and even Sloan\nRepublican momentum said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's this week\nDid my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then\nThey're smart when they talk about the president has to be removed by the twenty Fifth Amendment they think they are savvy when they discuss the coming fascism in this country there Eric all in the ...

with us Jimmy and Omaha great to have you how you doing sir\nThanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory about you I'm and I'm going to say in advance I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical\nTowards the media and the radical left in this country that I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of each day and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave or a blue wave I'm Sorry ...\nAnd I think I think these folks know that there is no red I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the the I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not nightmare and going to win the house back Democrats than the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state loses they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I would've said

behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump ... this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people would see under find people's data that Trump fires back at him\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about them if they did the miss characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative people\nSpokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands

were\n[noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I don't know what early vote a registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was ... and now Trump is drawing that parade President Trump\nToday complained about the pipe bombs being sent the prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about them in terms of even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens\nAnd the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans would go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this was another example of Trump\nPacing just like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nOf lowered the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and no way to back up what she was alleging\nSo some people think that he's um during the same thing here are basically tampering expectations with the bombers suppression\nState but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be

first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe ahead of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am

guy for some period of time inspiring it motivating revenue him up I mean there's so\nMuch that we don't know yet and we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is despite all of\nThat there is enough information to glean simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today\nAnd you add that to what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democratic party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years on this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big\nThat is so outrageous what\nHas been done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why did the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver\nSo called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was how many dropper or your advisors who is obviously fills out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign and stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea he drugs do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador to step up just pulled up the we we know that the Russians have a lot of humor emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told him well they planted his in his head\nHe didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true so Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation to go get the ... orange what's all bogus\nThat was not when the investigation started it started way before\nThat my point is how much the deep state wants their government back we don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to\nOur government the strings the levers of power their positions in at the un I cannot relate to we can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's they are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years ... who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool\nThe cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wit and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion with on well if I Believe all of that to be
