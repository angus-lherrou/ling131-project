looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday I made a leftist were convinced that Mueller by now was going to have issued a report proving

on him a sex scandal of some time that they\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the electorate is a big deal psychologically until you these people really fought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive\nBy media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it and it's holding it and it's going to release of the\nMost opportune time\nDespite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence\nAnd yet they're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant rising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many\nMonths maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking showed lawyers making sure the Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen from never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides were participating in the news\nNow is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled it's not there so they're turning they always do\nDo other things we also have the usual parade of celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advise\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\n\nWe now have the Oprah we're told the old for is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democratic governor for Georgia Stacey what his name

was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover it\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean the pumps I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's got on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the American left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here that is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust\nAn unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary and evidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair they of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purposes is racial or I was gonna say

who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy and victimhood in to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you notice how quickly they want to do that\nNotice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it the raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority of media you know they exempt themselves\nFrom having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said a ... to Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics you mean Don like the followers of black lives\nMatter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well there are cops and they mistreat and

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nIt's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd of people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why\nIs that why isn't it when he gives it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to\nDisagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation was we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today [noise]\nSpeaking of Kevin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all of a spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they have evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin all was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named a Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber ... serial rapist where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political stunt\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed them the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate winter he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin all of us have been rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of cattle dog did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media is doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin all of a stir it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if Woolsey Ford were actually telling the truth\nShe would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats sought to get rid of capital but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made public things I've terrify do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nHis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYou Republicans running for office have you ever been debates left you need to start asking\nA Democrat opponents they still opposed Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the ...\nUh\nSo it's it's going to be self contained on the watch but for people that do not have a watch are not going to get one McCarty a device here for Ninety nine bucks and Amazon

as a relevant thing uh back to the phones we go to Minnetonka, Minnesota this is a Ella image great to have you here with his Hi\nThank you so much for taking my call I was a twelfth\nGrade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession as he was becoming more than I can handle I started writing my class has caused courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration at the end of the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our honors and say come on in the way the Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nIs specially looking after I take a device and click on up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were a strong and we're not when dead\nNow once the ship Dr performed has examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again walking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back they ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that could not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nWell I that's what people are thinking listening to you tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to\nThose who could work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one paved streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful is that we were on the whole lotta buddy not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about the kind of history he's gonna feed learning it's um I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books to oh wow you know very was hurt because I think that\nWhere's he going to get it is not going to learn it from his own history buffs all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph to Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver at Boston University at Boston University of way back in the nineties did a survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph\nIn reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in and American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zinn as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we are they checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe we're a much newer and younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be helping we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nTo demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love what America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nOf any announcement are you ready when\nApple announced that the new ... book is made of one hundred percent recycled aluminum\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game standing ovation and I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement worn any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that there was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who have been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer units made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes now let's go to the audio sound like this\nThis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by hundreds of protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome and told him what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not so ... what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come in every did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the university\nOf Pittsburgh Medical center\nPresident Trump's first lady you market Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded him

race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show you count was ... in two thousand ten\nWhen the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast them the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness and herself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened\nYou wish you the ... and if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales in two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats\nThe left was done that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain\nWhat's gonna happen they end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from uh motives are real clear politics by one of the written down their\nWhole analysts and data analyst there is Sean ...\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as mitten terms and her final stretch and I'm going to tell you what this long\nPiece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch to twenty eight ten midterms\nAre working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half that's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI kinds of things as Mr ... that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of up to twenty five to two hundred ten Democratic majority\nBut this is hair splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not Mr trend days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some racism good that the ... British of numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority and I swam Republican but wait he is are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to two\nTwenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter]\nBut that's just me into being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point but the president is job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things [noise]\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this will be enough to flip the majority but it's never craft run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into way closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related are the errors\nMeaning how reliable aren't on the state and then the next\n... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people have voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so what's going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh um [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem that says right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of prices regardless of whether\nThat happens\nAre well set up for such as eventuality bottom line I happened to us why this idea what's going to happen but my job is\nWe must reach fortified the Fort Campbell walls around reason and I know that if we're going to save the western way of life then we
