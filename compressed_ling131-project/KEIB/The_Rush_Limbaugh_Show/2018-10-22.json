show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show again they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America does and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show gave and of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think it'll put sort of things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want it to last so he did what he could change it I I Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans would look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them if they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters begin to I don't doubt\nIs the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras\nTo the southern border of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it I mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't

city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them we're also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it rains mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else\nSo Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging at a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world it's so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest for being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having them may I ask the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun and this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just a race to the border and say to the world come\nOn it because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAnything in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any room breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell

stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say what you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks it is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nYou he may not send the military they may call as a as a congressman

force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communist think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics I don't care if you're a militarized as the border that if they\nBomb rush the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or tear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and Senate back into the emergency session and do our national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob of seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean are you using Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down today started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people who planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and

O'Rourke\nWas the answer to me in the originated rock rib conservative Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke he's love by everybody outside Texas thirty eight million dollars he raised in a quarter except\nThere's a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping ahead in even in the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real\nAnd yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke gonna be the guy and it can take out Ted Cruz\nHas anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke\nEvent you have\nA venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get in\nThat is not the kind of thing that happens with in a political party that is losing losing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies you know I'm not opposed to this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in the in the Phoenix area\nAnd that the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going through it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be they sent me a video that they took what their iPhone tennis max\nDriving along the entire line in order to make the video fit to be in a size they could email to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis is that just doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know\nNational media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of Bradley's these ... these kinds of people\nWhat the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\nThe turtle and his wife are at a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky and some mad kept asinine protesters shows up and just start shouting things will turn will just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't\nSay anything the other\nPatrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched them talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such a shame that we lost a little\n... and this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave and I said decent\nPeople don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against on the Democratic side I Do whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into what Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures in the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven\nThousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium it's Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand people in there\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have marched jumped through Mexico mad walk out of your most people really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you the thousands\nUpon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nHow many of you by the way how many have you joined a crowd of of of of Seventy five thousand people at a Seventeen or Eighteen thousand seat venue and yet they do I wouldn't I wouldn't if I drop by and saw the crowd that been can't go home watch it on TV [noise] try\nHe's to the Patriot am eleven fifty [noise]\n\nOkay back to the phones we go to a certain voting\nIn Macon Georgia great to have you with us on ER network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about Wilton it's great to have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called I spend a lot of years and military are retired from the Korean although we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the year ... not good at so this situation and look I'm I'm One hundred percent for Clinton military all the war but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you say the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife for my got let's Italy\nAnd military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we are very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nOkay what about this what about just the presence here is the U.S military standing at the border you\nWill not cross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're about you don't you and your like your your your ears will let you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force but not leaf all\nWe have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down to squeal like a pig and then it's all ... we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lewis Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it and I know how to do it\nNow that still terrible you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWhile there what is it what's the proper ... we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force I'm like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound in since I don't mean that they\nHold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line at probably what Bush or talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit that it would storm that caused the mob the rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially storm the bullet storm and gotten you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they're met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casually or to the drive by half of their story Trump Jerry fires on harmless or an armed hopeful as people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is still a lot of men nope\nNope half to hold a lot it and like I said somebody is what Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the change of clothes or legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they this was what they take it all by taking this just\nYeah okay right so the responsibility for what happened to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] a left I'd I'd look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're listening to the network\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to send my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's who'll\nAdvisor home advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews them from their mental ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is at home in mind is completely free you\nGo to ... got ... boy download the ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage or well our investment advice is about ... it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life viewing secure and your retirement and realizing your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you the path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your news people financial advisor ... dot com that's S C I F E L people make wasn't company incorporated member S.

back\nNow I Know a lot of your ... rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost count but they haven't this is just I don't believe that smokes these people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story ... all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not enough people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidates\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rallying for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of samples last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the when an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective\nNo that's communist language was talking about Florida as law or a collective he hit it would be a disaster for Florida right now is well liked anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrat leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants the government in charge of virtually everything for his purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open\nCriticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nUh in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and here Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies in disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santas would be great defense as as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there is nothing\nIf it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have are\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved we we\nStole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is deported because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt\nAt transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states being caused there deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to beat and you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life the\nDemocrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of means spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home\nMeaning you can try this for two months\nAnd if any points in those two months it doesn't meet your expectations or you've decided you don't like it just send it back and do
