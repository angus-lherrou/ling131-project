months I haven't made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American Left us to transform America I'm away from its intentions and its designs as talented\nAnd in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration will look to do it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out to\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh he couldn't define what that meant\nA there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transforming America man so what he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do is transform America away from\nOur unique founding\nConverted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist\nBack look and there's a poll out here today to some of the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taking\nA [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the ground is just what you see [noise]\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist then women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how\nWould that help can that be 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf

women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons at tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want him to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being\nHighly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communist socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just flapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I have been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America to trash white men that reminds me\nHang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite here it's a bit of that but I Do believe it to be there but it would have six or seven [noise]\n[noise]\nPoke quote Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal though except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\n[noise] another poll quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary it's combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime with the intrinsic American ideal\nOf white male privilege\nBecause Kevin is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long\nWhy did he blah

this program and was mean it means rush it can't be anything you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too\nCertainly is absolutely thinks that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I'm going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone through many first hours this week without getting to the phones that changes today especially\nBeing open line friday so we'll go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nHello that rush a good to talk with you\nI'm this Monica McClain who you were just just that you know the person that contacted 'em as Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she's the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nA heaping and there was coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring we wouldn't Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean in her and they test much she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this Monica McLean\nCorrect yes as a ... absolutely that's when they wrote the letter when when when Boise Ford wrote a letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with my client yet so\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering if not the Democrat oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\n... going to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote changes it was certainly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nNext not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference to that end Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls before the witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change it's not gonna change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it ABC CBS NBC began to report on this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate vote\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell a turtle ...\nWell the question is why wouldn't republic drift make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy they were ever to ah ah [noise]\nAh it's in the FBI report the Republicans I think Democrats can see it it's the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered it back\nTo my to my knowledge none of the senator grassroots soap or they're not measuring what we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you\nBet I'm Wondering myself [noise] um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure commonsense\nYou're sitting there thinking yes but well I Know this it would change everything it shows that the Boise foreign side is willing to commit perjury supporting perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories\nWhich then couldn't be standing to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not showing up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the Senate no it doesn't matter it's about the seriousness of the charge is not about the nature of the\nSea level New Rochelle Mickey I miss work

engage yes ma'am yes ma'am three bucks or whatever and go on\nShe did this\nBy alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... metro does Senator Grassley the chairman of the judiciary\nCommittee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen the turtle is adamant\nThis week the turtle and Grassley have been fit to be tied Grassley deal Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess they send it to Schumer remind us now that the Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from who've I eat and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you was shortly what producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly reviews ... produced this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations I don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence\nThat the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\n\nIt is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitting\nThat she took a lie detector\nWell her warriors did and that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass and we've been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegations she passed a lighter texture and we want to see it\nThey won't let them see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nAs a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd grass and they say you must be you must have something to hide that and he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy notes the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ my and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweat neck of the representatives what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony\nOr coaching her whatever I mean he loaded for bear this was the kind of ... out on the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't jump into the senator or the the\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member things are coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule by voting to confirm judge Kevin ... before that\nWas during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was even singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he calls the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and the the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these\nGuys on our side call out the Democrats like\nThis fit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got\nAn email last night from Salinas veto who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be Senate Republican political consultant they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a note from her last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened out there in these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did so for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nThe Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things\nCan you hear all your favorite radio

Delaware at the time the letter was written McLean former FBI spokesperson also worked for ...\nThe reason I'm going through all this is ... balls the Ford is is using people that are tired and linked at the hip and the heart and the brain the Democrat Party activism from the FBI to the department of justice to the Senate Judiciary committee\nNow Monica McLean warrior happens to be a guy named David Wasserman according to the Washington Post David Hoffman helped oversee\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server problem which she was exonerated\n... also helped oversee about Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in two thousand six neat\nSo how is it the balls the Ford ends up in the home of a woman who's\nTied to the D. O. J. and the FBI\nAnd characters who weren't involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation how does that happen if you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Paolo Alto\nAnd you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be on the Supreme Court and you don't think you should be because you think one time he\nAttacked you you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein than the next thing you know\nWell no no no that ... you sound fine signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain who probably\nWrites the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he\nNot a woman which she is so you're just you're a beach bam a psychology professor whatever from California and you end up\nWriting a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying\nAnd their lawyers don't tells you that the committee's wanting to fly out to California to interview you\nI I I Want I didn't know I I Know you I I Will you I Would have all of you who knew my home if you\nHad ...\nI don't even think I buy this they she didn't want them to come out there because she was going to go to Delaware to meet with McLean she didn't want the committee seeing who she was meeting with\n\nThis whole thing required her to come to Washington for this to pull off she had to come to Washington\n\nSo\nWe look at Hillary Clinton's email server investigation and the Trump Russia collusion or what do we find a woman who happens to be helping balls the foreign defeat Brett Kavanaugh and his nomination to the Supreme Court\nWith every Democrats saying within minutes of Kevin all being nominated they're going to oppose it\nWith every Democrats that they believe her even though she doesn't have any evidence in time magazine just put her on the cover\nNew covered time magazine was the gift occasion above board a west and she's she's she's seen taking meals a it's pathetic\nThis whole thing has been set up is my point and the people that set it up are the same people that have been running a sign with coups against Donald Trump\n\nAnd every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee knows everything I just told you but rather than it'd be a problem they're telling themselves how well organized they are and how brilliantly they pulled this off in their world\nThey've made the American people really believe that this woman was minding your own business one day when she was Fifteen and this nominee to the court came and brutalized her\nAnd she's just a woman that teach your\nChildren and fear of bees here [laughter]\n\nWhat a master plan we pulled off we got everybody in this country thinking added summing it didn't happen did that we have nothing to do with it when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay\nAnd that's why ... won't turn over any of the cycle ... the therapy and be a polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at\nAnd the Republicans notice too but the power of the Democrats look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and can confirm Kavanaugh\nIs democratic machine is a scary scary bunch Democrat machine includes the media and all of\nThese psychological deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committed violence we got one of them who has just been

just not the right man [noise] [noise]\n[noise] so Kimberly stressful now she changing you're not changing she is saying that our minds are made up\n\nThe wing is a Reuters story and it says essentially Murkowski has not made a wrinkle decision\n\nYou could have fooled me it sounded awfully final Jimmy this morning when I read it\nBrett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate right now now she's saying it's not her final decision\nSomething is happening in that regard [noise]\nHere Kimberly struggles tweets again the first one here well they're they're both right on the money\nJust to be clear yeah I'm trying to apple five days\nI'm I'm trying to make sure more people hear about these tweets and then we'll see them yeah absolutely it's worth it Kimberly straw so Wall Street journal columnist editorial page editor and writer just to be clear on what Lisa Murkowski voted for today\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted to legitimize and sign off on the most despicable tactics ever in the Supreme Court nomination\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted today just stand with Diane Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to\nPursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or doing [noise] the other interesting thing hang on let her do develop it here but hang on just second here's a second tweet from Kimberly Russell\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nToday voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially leave the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block which puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state\nDevelopment property rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right on the money\nLegitimizing signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nAnd men dasa they an ad in a number of other things just just [noise]\nNot much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he's not confirmed accord stays uh for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing it is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest ranking court that could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be ... to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch a leftist in charge of those issues in her state there's this shooting herself in the foot\nAll to supposedly\nBe in unison with me too movement\n[noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein looks like she has cornered Murkowski\nI don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked ... wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental camp there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally wasn't Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway at a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey're chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein's looks like she is well the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand up she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski it's an aggressive\nMove it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the digital camera do you see the pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of in a tent\n\nSeriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of diet for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on his little came to be able to see these that's that close up is the same shot\nJust to close up of the previously televised photo is that right\nWell done here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable she not\nI mean it's it's really pained look on her face and it\nIt looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for [noise]\n[noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call at romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes and form so you could be right ah it it could be a romantic under load I certainly what's\nThe old saw it's not for us to criticize who loves who and why [noise] so um\nYeah it can be a ... bat lovers quarrel we don't know but I've got to get these photos up the cocoa unless cocoa confided in Chicago couldn't find them himself or it may beat me to the punch now the other\n[noise] breaking story [noise] that's not a breaking story but\nIn the Senate campaign in Tennessee this is kind of interesting this is the marsh show Washburn story or race uh let's see [noise]\nMarsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is still breeders\nAnd\nBreathe is and is saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh and he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat and doing saying that he would vote\nTo confirm capital this is in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in this state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling David this is ... co workers seat And Corker by the way has also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody you haven't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these some pose the actions other men have engaged in against women\nBut his point is we have no evidence cabinet or did anything to anybody we're going to design a seat on the
