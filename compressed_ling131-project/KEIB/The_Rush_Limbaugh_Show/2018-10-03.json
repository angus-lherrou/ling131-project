of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where did I got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has on that that but\nThey've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election you want to maybe wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime\nNetwork documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\n\nWide cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there they claim he's mocking balls the forty wasn't marketing or walk I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my\nGod this is only acceptable I don't know why president that he did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine Blasey Ford there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right even if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very credible\nWill now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart specially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations would be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered comes from writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want he understands that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step\nAnd it it may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one year the New York times and it's been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what\nIs not part of any income tax\nStory on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often do you say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit it was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for bats yet they wanting Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a potent storage\nTrump was it totally comp was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zero not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump that he got rich from his dad\nActually a rash of something somebody said and changes are seen mostly are too young to remember\n[noise] a bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman comes for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in the audience just don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all at Johns\nYou're not that I watch it I don't know when you gotta do to try to walk with what you're going to come up with just like you're not gonna you're gonna come up with women like New Hampshire\nWhere the ... not a Democrat and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester with confronted a a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been around to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting having up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a ...\nI'm In no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor do harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with programming robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushback that it's a lost cause on the protestors\nProtestors not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and uncorroborated charged destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protests I Would fight and that would make sure women or heard clearly your care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cathy and I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for laughs\n[noise] so what does this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand if it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told this story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them

that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have these are the questions she should\nHave been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge her she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played right along with out ahead Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious to know what what's the purpose was um\nAll Trump is doing is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country an accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristine ball the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like I'm gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility\nIt makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't say Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling them as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the stuff that way it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change of are serious thing to do with looking at it than we are looking at at the moon to the right\nTo oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what he thinks\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique\nIs a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans have Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you what helped me irritates them\nHe shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has ... continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made them with rage other Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two dollars and they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's if it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... what a horrible everything is that is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply pushy she backed up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined that can you imagine if there was something going on that can you imagine a man organized for the express purpose\nOf destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell rush\nOr a million women or nor do there should we do well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not\nAbout even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and they've been ridiculed and made fun up in the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did was say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\n\nTo the radio I'm really lose those airline seats will stop shrinking under a Ninety billion dollar aviation bill heading for the president's desk\nAnd also grants the

taxpayers association for over forty years we fought against unreasonable taxes that make it harder to afford the cost of living\nLast year the California legislature voted for a huge tax increase on gasoline and car registration\nGovernor Brown signed it breaking his promise that there would be no new taxes without voter approval\nNow we finally have a chance to vote on these big tax hikes that make driving so expensive the repeal of that tax hike is on the ballot as proposition ... please vote yes on prop six repealing this unfair tax will see the average family hundreds of dollars every year and prop six guarantees that any future increasing the gas tax\nMust be approved by the voters were already paying some of the highest gas and car taxes and then they should why haven't our roads have been maintained\nDon't give the politicians more money to waste vote yes on prop six and visit our website at vote yes on prop six dot com\nPaid for by vote yes on prop six committee major funding from our job is taxpayers association\nThis is the patriots am eleven fifty or but written bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this um well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise]\nOccupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democrat Party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to get that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girls so they can go into girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate sick\nIt ... it in in many it's not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various uh gems\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination and racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise to these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage Jimmy angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\nA man community now\nIs on CNN\nAnd here it is is is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target up attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president for the other marking her like that because it gets Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they vote or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr ... testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have a gun adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people hide under [noise]\nAnd I'll guarantee you they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it such outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back yet\nTo be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat seemed to have our little but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them who are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while you are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me to\nGet away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been\nTaught and heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe that men have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions and so they could have unlimited sex\nYou did you\nEver um ah you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the right hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine if not better I by the way here's this you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly includes all women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way or being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from your young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about

Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed\nIn fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven polling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters\nOr matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski but if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them\nNow\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\n\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic they created a chart in essence\nBased on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents\nAnd it is the dates to ...\nEvery day to the different dates of the sordid event Dr ... says happened\nAnd the dates float\nShe's not even consistent with the death of the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSo the charge here in China tried serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some\nAh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story\nMultiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents in the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred in the mid ... Nineteen eighties\nWhen she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text
