much a celebrity focused rag against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comments on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night\nTrump and Leslie stall\nIs it you know General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances and say prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay I Know unless you have to try it again [laughter] I Know and my ... the answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but they\nHave to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhat general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people any more particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got up the roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating and some of the things I Would tell him about my opinion is with the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'd be really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where\nHe was a star when he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked I was really surprised by this honest\nThat's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else have you learned that he didn't know but thought he knew before he ran for office and I think\nLot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment he fully\nRush Limbaugh middle\nI'm lucky I feed network\nThey folks the IRS does not mess around you know this they have the power to take

more in tax revenue than the bottom Seventy percent of Americans pay one thousand forty nine people pay more in taxes than Seventy percent of the population pay [noise]\nK. E. A. B. Los Angeles this is the Patriot am eleven fifty broadcasting throughout the south land and all over the world I heart radio\nHurricane Michael's path of destruction and Lisa ... is President Trump and the first lady or in Florida\nIn other words the end and the top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of total individual income tax so in other words the bottom fifty percent paid three percent\nThere isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes and yet how often do you hear every pot both parties\nPoliticians running around and we're going to middle class after the middle class pregnant burn through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore\nWhen it comes to income taxes\nNow which small percentile of taxpayers also paid\nThree percent or more it's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone have free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred for digital rounded to fourteen hundred and\nFourteen hundred tax payers paid more than the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one in the bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent of the top\nOne thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich not decreasing it is not true to say they are not paying their fair share\nNow this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people sheltering last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay it\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind\nSupply side economics supply side tax policy at the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for gene hungry\nPeople out of three hundred and some odd million is it fair that fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever going to change because\nIf you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom ... percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share of taxes that we are going to ... and so the bottom Seventy physical yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid that\nHe thought Donald Trump looked like he was thinking

guy's on my side just guys going to do wonders for me how does he know what's going on in\nTrump's him they have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist I this is the kind of I think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it but I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support them befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall we were up here at number just as a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity of consequences\nFor illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their parents\nHas the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by Kay didn't enforce hang on for them were launched that narrow tolerance power to deter families with children and then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate\nWhen you allow the parents to stay together okay when you allow\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our country are you gonna go back to that cat is less is\nLesley from coming into our country illegally and part of\nI mean part of the reason that I have to blame myself the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United states you know my\nFault Leslie I've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it now she says she misspoke there\nThis law on the ... Obama certainly didn't for separation of just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama did it than there has to be good reasons for it\nRemember went down to two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWhat it was on the books but he didn't force it what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump has enforce it but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included attempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just enacted one that's separate they don't run from their family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole\nPremise some guy keeping abandon kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy and force them to be a band and he was saving them\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat of a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families when it's a law that he inherited I'd look explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond that\nEverything that has always made other Republicans back off\nOr cave or sue for peace or what have you and Donald Trump does not respond to any of it\nAnd I loved is challenging the way she asked him the questions in the way she is not following up on his answers the way she

or an anti bail them a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood was black you're black\nOr this was this was a grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThat only if you'll excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection allergy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany it against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is not even about her future run she needs to tell her base I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists concept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you\nDefine that let glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so you're more than welcome to find a good host I remember that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out it comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later if now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersects finality because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay nitric intersection out all the foreign me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking uh you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out I mean it's basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist taboo this strain about them that that that the\nUh cohabitation with that with militant Islamic lists that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify hurt cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ship has declared a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old ... ... she's arrested him anyway she is a woman therefore he has impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty four in India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't know me you've never seen me but believe me I'm white\nHowever what I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship and African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American his\n... just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor for the Afrikaners are not black uh uh well I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to black skin okay All right\nJust want to mess up because that sub Saharan this is somebody what are you in sub Saharan what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent and some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Sahara Desert\nOr which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of this arid desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that not withstanding\nThe accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract from\nMid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away\nAnd so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the because the elections I I think a lot of
