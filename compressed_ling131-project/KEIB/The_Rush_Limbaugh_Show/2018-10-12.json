{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "The [noise]\nDone [noise] I'll talk to you later [noise] for\nThem to the program glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air is fascinating is really really really a fascinating as one of those guys to his you know really walk through the fire for his principles um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump down from South from\nJust days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a the ... will\nBe really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times today doesn't the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric\nHolder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low Isay hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\n'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I'd taken behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic what's the difference between\nThat and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that\nThey did what they're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves as the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said the holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized writing but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to ... what\nMade them almost unbeatable for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other\nDemocrat justice hard nose they at least tried to hide it\nThis switch is now overt we are harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said there's now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part\nAnd it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X. they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the the that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd it ... they would have followed Malcolm X\nThings might have been worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nBack very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean people want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no as you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant I mean that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the alt right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking is\nEither they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people are like you know what the right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know what I don't know not to get a bit Steve Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct and that's not even\nNot seats that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews in blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I'll be ... there was an actual death in Charlottesville right yeah yeah and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was also over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there was ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and was going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\nThey just won't recognize it\nAh and you know who won the leftist standing up\nWho is standing up and going oh we don't want to be you know that's not us we don't want to be a part of that\nThey just denied that it ever happened\nAnd it gives them this

I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead mentioned there were some now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there talking on a tax on the Internet who were claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThat Bush was hearing that hurricane Bush himself the president was fearing the hurry and and what this guy\nIs professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be and whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the redneck\nRiviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida blow both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters have got wiped out the odds are that work\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we look at these events are these people do as one wants to political events [noise]\nSome of these people who had been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back\nAnd apartment adjusted for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrants to snoop on Trump's campaign communications and they did so by getting the size of war which means that without a Hillary's embalming here they wouldn't have been a fight the application\nSean Hannity today on the patriots am eleven fifty a\nFox News I'm Chris foster told about eighty percent of the areas and Florida hit by hurricane Michael been covered by search and rescue teams looking for bodies were survivors needing help at least eleven deaths are blamed on the storm FEMA administrator Brock Long says besides making sure everybody has the central is in a place to stay\nOther focuses on communications uh you have to be able to communicate to appropriately response um and you know we're we're trying to do everything we can to get the private sector vendors of horizons and Eighteen to ease the world to get in to try to get their systems back up and running or about one\nPoint four million power outages from Florida to Virginia President Trump's tweets pastor Brunson will be home soon Andrew Brunson to free man in Turkey after two years in prison in house arrest accused of supporting an overthrow the Turkish government South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham tells box I\nNever believe one minute the pastor Brunson but has any ill will toward the Turkish government is this is Fox News [noise]\nNo traffic on the Patriot am a level\nThat accident in echo park in the south wanna wanna Glendale union stole his over city north for all five Washington were being sponsored by reform California yes on proposition six the gas tax repeal California's cost of living is too high do something about a\nVote yes on prop six the gas tax repeal politicians won't fix the roads they just want more of your money vote yes on prop six to reveal the costly\nAnd unfair gas in car tax hikes yes on prop six the gas tax repeal I'm ...

know what's the problem is I mean\nLike oh yeah she does the ... the problem is they're trying to scare everybody into signing on to this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing on the whole premise of climate change your dream to a lot you're agreeing you are to blame\nAnd that's a big one\nBecause when you agree that you are to blame then they hit you with but you can fix it you you you can make amends and how do you do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you you agreed to start criticizing everybody else\nSo they get you to accept blame then

another one Susan Glasser\nStaff writer at the New Yorkers she writes a weekly column on life in Trump's Washington\nShe writes a weekly column on life in Washington in Trump's war what life in Washington has become because of Trump once a week\nThis piece the headline I listen to all six Trump rallies in October and you should to some had it's not a reality show it's real it's a long piece but do not misunderstand\nThis lady Susan B. Glasser listed in didn't watched six Trump rallies\nAnd she is up set that they're only on CSPAN she's mad that Fox has stopped covering them that CNN is stopped covering them that pie MSNBC uh stopped covering them because she thinks they are damaging to Trump\nShe thinks if the people of this country's\nSolve these rallies that it would be the end of Trump She points out how Trump lies all the time how Trump exaggerates all the time she totally\nMiss understands the purpose of the rally she does not exactly yes I predict that she does not get the connection\nOr the bond between Trump attendees after rallies Trump supporters and Trump\nShe totally does not get this she\nDoes not know how to listen to the Trump She does not know how to uh empathize with Trump rally attempt to she has no\nAbility\nTo relate to Trump has his supporters do she watches these things and she is\nAppalled at Trump personally politically he lives all the time\nHe exaggerates he mocks people he makes fun of people he's means meanwhile\nPeople at these rallies or having the best time of their lives it's the highlight of their week to go to a Trump rally and this woman is ... she's watching six of them so far this month\nAnd totally does not get it she is missing the purpose of the rallies she does not see that this is Trump's mechanism for getting past the media she does not see that this is how Trump net\nGates and goes over the drive by me something Reagan also amassed\n\nTheir masterful they are formulated even though everybody thinks they're improv and off script they are formulaic there are segments in every Trump rally and he follows them to achieve what he says differs in some cases\nBut the point is here's a drive by media specialist ... and totally doesn't get it\nIt's the exact opposite\nIf these rallies were televised nationally\nAs they used to be\nThere wouldn't be any talk of a blue wave anywhere except New York and\nCalifornia Rush Limbaugh never\nUse the word\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women to protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends that may Hendra\nAre holding their fifth annual military salute give away the winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicles that's right a brand new read my hindrance retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my handwritten you could be next\nTo nominate somebody who is active duty or a veteran of the U.S military and to get official rules\nVisit Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for them a hindrance military salute give away\nThanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices and test driving a hindrance today at ... of Southern California enacted or visit A.

[noise] but she put it up and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw it because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true\nAnd it's it's\nFairly common that these people on the left\nEngage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump ...\nThe Democrats blue wave is drying up oh if that will be a disappointment don't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly governor twenty Eighteen mid terms\nStill point do a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely till Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now yet yet now we\nPointed out that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave would if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling and people have been asked well how can this ... this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots\nThat shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much ...\nHow could a generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggest for Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the authority and the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every\nOther seat that they have they held by incumbents at at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's [noise]\nLet me go state by state to show were this was all happening and but the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional gear party out of power wins ... that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen and you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races somebody could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening ... probably has opened in some cities or reading of certain theatres it's God's know\nThe trial of America's biggest\nKiller now ... there's an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanting to murder\nOf thousands nobody\nCan get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and categorized as something other than what it is\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at like ed Morsi of hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty different articles\nSo the trick has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars I think people will start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed it how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits of thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a it's a\nProcedural movie like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder\nThere is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent\nGore and violence in the movie it's it's to pick them in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left with me\nAbout a story like this it can't avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraiser you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happens to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass\nMurderer he was a mass murderer of people in the room\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this and I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie a target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so\nWhen I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy you as a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the story itself\nIs all anybody needs to know the number one mass\nMurder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left\nAbortion is not even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with this deem came as one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a gazelle himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings and\nFor somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\n\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess or as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGoing to be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought\nThat they don't need to do that tell the story of the story itself tells itself the trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have put everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made\nA lot of people to put their careers in the line agreeing to appear and start even ... see a directing\nA close friend of Washington
