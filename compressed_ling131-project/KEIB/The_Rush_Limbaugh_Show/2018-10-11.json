felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan is it the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the cooking I it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they really hit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right one were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away at well that that's\nTrue too I I think they

working the for rats lying\nYup threats flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs it we don't show up that's why that's why you see

coincidence\nThis is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to and I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise]\nThis is Trump calling in to Fox and friends today is talking to Steve do see a doozy said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little lead other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time either make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected by it we added on a great control I don't think really\nThey go to a very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up that expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney general said they go low we kick them and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics to be\nCareful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's willing to discuss things safe for them to make a very dangerous they put older [noise] what is held in contempt by Congress older when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to be told you like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever we sat on the Republicans win Wimbledon away or not even acknowledge or or they would say\nWe strongest terms oh we'd denounce\nRhetoric co authored by a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely a unilateral condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] [noise] that I can tell you that he'd better be careful what he's wishing\nNow the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there are enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course ... flies\nIn the face it is the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking aren't\nPulling people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to Trump but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's all [noise] when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash\nWe were in one percent GDP now or a four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression it was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with plenty of money he was it was very easy [noise]\nI'm paying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well\nThat traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy is a great performing and growing economies so for renting\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the fed is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump ... know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve German the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning because of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election was why things down\nSo they react to it and and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day rollercoaster I\nThink there's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ...\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids\nAre there are some that I Am a not in love with yes and what we need them out slowly but surely\nThere have been some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get by the lake so I think a lot of the lake so not links that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand not even a letter written to the times that there is a chance\nWould make perfect sense to me but the thing is well here I'm up against my

[noise]\nNew York magazine and look at it as Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenty sixteen election results is is not a wary of looking back watch let's retrace steps it was the last debate\nBetween the Trump stir and the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not gonna sit here and tell you right now that I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes at a we counted the votes\nThey wanted\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nThe trouble with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was gonna win in a landslide then they the soundbite would be in the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat an upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up they said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans if people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we never\nI Believe is saying this this is an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixty in senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump had openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate with Clinton and October the nineteenth you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nThan roads seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo Lisa rice to try an forestall a political crisis by validating be election results\nSo this is not funny looking back there hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and condo leisurely\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election results in addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and ... rice\n\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have fun result as well as the conclusions rich by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed\nThey hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place\nAnd no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're going to use your Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that was going to validate her election even more\nThat was going to make her an
