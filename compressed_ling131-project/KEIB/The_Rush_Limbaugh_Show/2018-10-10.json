people love about the American left and the Democratic party\nShe went out there and get her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging people to be an civil\nAnd she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition the Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return just civility\n\nI mean they're making that case they're proving the point and there isn't I don't see in all of this in all of this\nCrazy deranged unhinged behavior of left wing activist\nI haven't heard one elected Democrats did announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or in the party from it\nI haven't heard one\nBe elected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back\nI haven't heard one they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they all\nAre and what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility\nWhat did I tell you yesterday were not in the battle of ideas anymore we're not an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify the people who want to be part of American knocked\nAnything to do with our founding not the constitution knocked a declaration that's

things they're so desperate for good news they're desperate for you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks\nI'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team\n... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord Benson\nA former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that Lloyd Bentsen right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for they hold up town Butowsky code red alert to Democrats\nWhat are the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the he'll got kind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama one of the most popular respected public figures in America should spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate\nThis column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way this column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms\nAre the most popular in the respect and Democrats in America such as Michelle my bell Obama to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid terms with a nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up\nI thought you're pretty much had the house already done\nAlthough she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on then Trump or verse myself\nNow there is a twenty five percent chance that Democrats\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare scenario that's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of the way it was it's a moment for balls in maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible the Democrats win the house by a significant number of seats\nHow ever it is also possible Democrats again only ... seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\n... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and triumphant\nTrump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you'd do not understand confidence when you see it you see love\nYou see hatred UC excitement you think you see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies you somehow see division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant Trump will stand along side Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved but unstoppable dominance\nOver his party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert right to boot Dallas gave warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president\nWho tried to criminalize his opponent [laughter] whacked\nAt the greater risk of losing their seats in the house now how is that possible\nGiven everything else we're told by the Democratic party and the drive by media they tell us America loves the moderates\nAmerica loves the centrists America doesn't want any part of extremists America wants no part whatsoever radicals and yet there is the entire Democratic Party which is nothing but radical now\n\nMy point is again\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispirited or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is\n... up the turnout ... up interest\nAnd they're really flux and ticked off at a bunch of polling\nData there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News pull a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in polling\nData that they have a renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed to happen\nThat's why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative suburban\nWomen and do we need them or not and we don't\nThey say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six soon as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of a\nA convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win\nTrump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprising guy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all the press the Trump headquarters that's what they wanted you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is though power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American ... says the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the trying times are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... comes or attempting to sway American opinion a head of the elections\nWho do the ... wants a whim [noise]\nTry comes want the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party to win in the trunk counter not our friends at try calms want American leadership they can easily manipulated and triumph over\nThe ... I don't want any part of Trump Donald Trump\nThis this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this was done this\nHas put China back on its heels like nobody fought Donald Trump the United states now controls access to Mexico and uh all of North America United States and Canada\nYou've got to go through us you've got to make deals with us if you want to export your gorge into Mexico Canada United States because Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the track comes never thought this was going to happen\n\nThey don't want Trump they don't want any more if Trump they would be eager for whoever the Democrats put up I just find it fascinating international bunch of communists\nAre trying to affect our elections so that they're friendly Democratic Party in America wins\nThat somebody has to have a lot to say Russia's probably ... being met for\nWhen you put a safe in your home what would you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one branch of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right ...\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skills sweat and talent\nTo produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhinos saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe I'll check out their extensive Deaver network on line at rhinos safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

Ford for her allegations what message does that send to women\nAnd remember women went for President Trump in two thousand six name Hillary seven white women did I'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one white women all white women\nWomen went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice that last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\n\nExcept for a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why is this kind of a Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n\nThe left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to seat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do\nTo become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm On four of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they had to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on I'm for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal ...\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws in reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the\nMost certainly example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy the ass not by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other\nWe're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christie on on on\nFor listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nThe Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instance\nTornado making landfall in areas that are close to the uh\nI'm Glad this guy said it's close to the ... that that's where would you read about the high wins in the race that's where the Bronx of it is now this storm is so strong that it's bad as you get away from the ... but the real bad stuff is the I

emails on this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves want to suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nPlans you may think that and I'm not going to try to just abuse you of it but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump ... seem to have any real interest in the doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not\nConvey\nProper information about him is his only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to
