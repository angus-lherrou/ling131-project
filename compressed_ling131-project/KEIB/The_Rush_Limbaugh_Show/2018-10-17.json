you mean about the show ... he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nFor having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you wouldn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when suddenly said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's impossible\nThere is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was

the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here start campaigning is if this blue wave weren't a deadlock\nIf the blue waiver at while you started to me [noise]\nYeah I got a couple a couple of stories Democrats that's not the worst Obama they're asking where in ...\nOn a means doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore we do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk about myself\nAnd what about the your tweets or so for these people that say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting not\nOh and I don't think that would be talking to you if I did that that's the way of getting the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nBut some of those but there's so much this information being put a [noise] that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour [noise] I don't go to it and I thought social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest autonomy and the history of our country and there's nothing we poured it\nOr you go it's that simple he's the only way he get his message out he's not going to stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated than it is CNN's media media whatever guys they didn't\nDo much talking residents just too much media there's too much he's gotta he's

Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces intensify and pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents everything has\nBlown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on them Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blew up on them every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now\nYou know they've thought all along the mother is going to get the goods on how Trump's\nFoley election by cheating in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Mahler is not going to deliver your key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but they're they're looking to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up base\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been\nThey've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia Mahler has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished after the terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this folks\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies and the drive by media rather than\nBreak the rules and release the report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrapped up his mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment are going to be talking it up before the midterms\nIn hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election is imminent that\nIs what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed out there\nThe ill educated under educated on an educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that will then influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here\nIs\nWill create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when\nMullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might\nAll of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really ended\nThis because his report goal is to Rosenstein who is technically is bars at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not that it is made public\nSo if the Democrats do when the house\nThey're going to insist that Mahler not include the investor you protect\nDot com that's S C I F ... dot com bubble wealth management on investment banking [noise]\n[noise] okay we're going to start on the phones were momentarily I Need to issue a brief apology weight loss dental cam video\nFeeds shortly after the end of the first segment and the ... the reason is they think my energy here might have blown out the circuitry a necessity ... we were only there for what was in five minutes max\nNot even that uh we know when it goes down a on our own\nBecause we have warning systems early warning systems or emergency services warning so we know so we saw it immediately it was down there and the only thing we can think of was that I blow it out with the energy level here of the content of the program ... booted it were up\nAnd running now so the downtime was minimal\nSorry for that if it affected you hear is Tom in Morris county New Jersey so we have to the phones readings are great to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russia I have two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat host your teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter\nOut there for for ... and ... when does your support for Trump again during the campaign OK okay or the campaign one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats were fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you what frustration is so high\nRight now for not only myself people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said the Trump ...\nAnd he says she's the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweak most of the time\nAnd the press conference fish they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well and that shocked you write\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen\nHow we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a nationalist press and try to reach people that his tweets don't read short audio ... that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people are in the same boat\nWho are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it baffles me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea your newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a wage is going up\nWhat am I ever seen anything my point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all\nOf this and that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with the lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievements\nAnd we take a break for that has to have much to say\nRussia probably by being met for\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are

[noise]\n[noise] ... be Los Angeles this is the Patriot am eleven fifty broadcasting throughout the south land and all over the world I our radio they\nDidn't know I mean the Brady facts knee is President Trump suggesting Saudi Arabia's leaders shouldn't be guilty until proven innocent\nContemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth\nBut you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules that is the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something\nMistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists the U.S a call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that had me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people\nAbout it and they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or on a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs lot if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them anything for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper\nIs one of the most they pick up all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\n\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists as the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this fleas editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not particularly like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from one to

the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny that were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over and over Trump saying it while accusing him of\nMocking her mocking is not what he did to mock or he would have had to attempt
