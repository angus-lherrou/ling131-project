lives were told over and over and over again to dope\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a centrally be cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they want their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out because we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S

months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of caused the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest\nHimself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision about the law is Obama told about drawing a red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousand tenet germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell where did you think about it was great government knew remember who started or remember who\nAnd he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you got to look up to him but you're you're so far but neither me can't see you just look it up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where his ... for rock Obama\nCouldn't create these economic circumstances if his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe that what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny

was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay\nVote against the interest of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when it came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand and\nPut a picture up we got a picture for you to get a camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have to picture side by side make the switch on the left is Obama in Nevada on the right is Trump last night in Houston\nAnd dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right there's something really really awful about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media\nThey've been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen to things they think are real are so devoid\nOf reality and truth that they're on able to accept it Jim Jim Jim Acosta having\nThe president whip people up at a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this was at the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job is covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people will give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where people up into a frenzy got attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man we're has this guy begin to see Trump\nWhipping people up and rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as\nJim you can give you got\nAll kinds of you could go be a waiter you obviously listen well\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou're thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in\nAnd do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately for body slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho is doing these body slammed moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting a good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and then I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for making maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media they'd love to hear from me\nAnd everybody in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack\nHillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the\nEmails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think the Trump is recommending and praising ... girl violence ... but they just I I've never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up to this\nGuy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you're doing I really didn't want to see what you're drunk you know I'm just wondering what the dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with\nYou so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you let somebody throw it back on them and it said ... it's great that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand the real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who are elected him\nI think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that when we get back\n[noise] somebody has to have to say Russia's probably by being met for\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance rosy were larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old\nAnd a hundred thousand dollar larger life ... did you know\nYou can convert that my policy into cash right now\nI'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy\nAnd the cold hard cash I Know the economy's been a struggle for many\nPeople need cash they need it right away and you can get cash right away for your life ... give your over Seventy five you have a one hundred thousand dollar or larger life almost you know I Want you to write this number down give these folks because it's all free get rid of those insurance premium stopping those turn that policy and a cash right this number down eight four four we buy Seventy five\nUse the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever\nCall eight ...

Fox me is that vice president Mike Pence on the death of a Saudi journalist President Trump has already expressed is concerned that there have\nStupid to know what's good for you which\nIs how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left it's how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton the deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything was always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them they've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack\nPlans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past and kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning\nTo promise to do this that and the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly intimidated they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to their Jim Acosta\nIn Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a\nWeek or longer and he can't stand it after all his\nHard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump you'll keep falling for the ...\nLive and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to have that anymore but what is troubling as the ... behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believes\nAnd he does it I think because it's still works instill riles people up that divides us horribly\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now who believes this he does it I think\nBecause it's still works that seat so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's probably knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spending golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to one piece that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but Williams cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbong letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate\nTrump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from MySpace every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating in for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats\nHave no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased print says five

marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this or go larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate\nAmerica it does folks not that every leftist hates America but the leftists either no right to alert in her at all\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood miss they hate his certainty that America is exceptional they hate his mistrust of intellectuals\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all she doesn't

he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself invents and uses\n\nI'll tell you folks and this is a heck of a paragraph is instructive itself\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity Democrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claim to despise Trump's they hate\nThat he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he\nIs certainty that America is decent than exceptional\nThey hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some\nSerious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many\nPeople are just not right and everybody is that you you just don't wait too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it fine no you're wrong and I know you haven't even far halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they love equip\nVacation they love people see both sides of the things they he reaching out with the heart they hate certain movie especially when it conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks kind of strange that the left hates him for because he is filthy rich always has been and unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever\nHe never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities\nGuy went swimming doesn't see the need to apologize for sometimes\nHe's treated women disgraceful aid for which Americans left and right or a shamed of him as they are at JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most of ... the average American that Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad in other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find
