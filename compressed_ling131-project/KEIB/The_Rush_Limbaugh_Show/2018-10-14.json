B. I. documents released she wants a full\nFledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking you're talking about Gerald ... House Judiciary committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house and that they're going to impeach cabin or they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what\nYou and I wouldn't call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I don't even try like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a Democrat voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing and twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they gonna win at a landslide they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the electorate and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats app large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrats protesters they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but\nFor those that don't get it it amazes me but it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative\nOf the ah the party at large here's J Christian Adams\nWriting is PJ Media Kavanaugh photos fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo but there's any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams riding I visited the hospitals for the seriously mentally\nIll and the shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery weren't as odd and on earth way it has anything I ever heard in side a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning apple dude\nAnd then the role was called but it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting how willing screaming in an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was wage was I hate\nIt was poisons in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and they were the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to themselves\nAnd their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the\nLeast bit concerned about it the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large it doesn't seem to worry at all this kind\nOf discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\n\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in to not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics Andy insane face to face but what it means to me is I don't know that they can get more rapid\n\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen to get the more fired up than they

that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand\nShe couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some aimed coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously I guarantee you they were looking at\nThose crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy envy\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed it upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get him\n... with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made a speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would\nBe that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons the daily wire has the story\nWashington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that their embarking on a nationwide stadium\nTour taking the Clinton stage show to Thirteen cities this ball it's going to be called an evening when President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show it'll feature the Clintons\nSharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers in public service while also discussing issues of\nAnd looking toward the future the tour is being sponsored by live nation by nation also hosting a stadium tour for Michelle my bell\nThe Clinton turtle start in Las Vegas November Eighteenth ... Sunday this is after the midterms it'll crisscrossed the country ending in Los Angeles next April\nTickets go on sale this Friday October to twelve and they're not cheap if you want to see the Clintons joint speaking tour that Clinton was stage show the Clintons national stadium to her at the park theatre in Las Vegas the cheapest seats will cost\nBut the Republican governor of California is is closer than is running if Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house I think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't seen the meltdown\nThat is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are so so certain they're going to win this they've already banked on the when they're all ready planning to impeach\nCapital and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't think\nI really think they may lose it all [noise]\nVery quickly\nLadies are you up with the man calling the shots for you know with\nA little more of a sex is that you need or a blood test of off off you can finally ... power is keeping Hillary Clinton safe from tough questions to Hillary Rodham Clinton festival on Fox is easy to use on totally opposed to just snapping around both in other regions of the potential for under\n... store in control a baby with a remote the giants are on I Wanna watch Senator Clinton she's thinking [noise]\nFox News I'm Debbie hand like President Trump is making additional disaster assistance available to Florida including direct federal assistance Republican governor Rick Scott survey the damage in the panhandle area today he says there's progress but more work to be done\nWhen the most frustrating things I think for all of us right now is there anybody does that power on that's very frustrating but the other is just a telecommunications\nThe president visits Florida and Georgia tomorrow treasury treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin under pressure from some CEO's were planning to attend an investor conference in Saudi Arabia this after the disappearance of Washington Post columnist\nJamal could show gate Larry Kudlow director of the national economic council says it's important\nLaw with the president and the general investigation mismanaged and we'll make up his mind as they wait for grasses and his new information surfaces on ABC's This week this is hot new\nBachelor\nThis is science green bloom president of special city I like their specialist so much about the company\nThat's all sort of semi locations where are the yellow pages under ... [noise]\nWay [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] you're listening to Russia's week in review hey welcome back Rush Limbaugh half my brain tied behind my back as always main interests of fairness and equality [noise] sorry\nLast caller Sean from Philadelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from political [noise] just just today political story ready for this political race ratings than\nGOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believed this okay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly or leaning Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there\nTo eight teams the majority so\nTwo hundred and nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to\nNine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of the nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump that some people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since the election\nNight through thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of discussed other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started we said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching this this last week was premier week for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and us you'll be or something and\nAnd uh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage\nAnd the FDU cops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand the first order and\nYou know no officer you know our\nGovernment money is separating the two parents that are born or and I am having them\nAnd the cops we fought ever say oh wow we don't have\nPerverted here we have a hero this guy and I watch the said well that's it for the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block\nAd the idiots\nDinner parties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on average than Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John Powell that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate just begging everybody they got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend them while telling him he needed to resign one of them was a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower\nI knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only\n[noise] but I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\nCocoa get a picture to guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here in ... show you're on the digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says that John Powell\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... ... that's what it was [noise] they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault and the and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car than\nScreech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun\nBut I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn or assaulted by John Tower um\nBut but you know she is hurting someone here yeah there's one more bite we got Times Square here here's another reason why number forty three when I\nThink about it I thought I'm so glad I didn't do it because I could have been Anita Hill and Anita Hill's life has been completely ruined destroyed don't went ahead and going to be the person who was in that hearing talk about is disgusting Christine seizing Ford's name came out against her well she didn't want to be there and what\nI think is that if I had been Anita Hill and I'd known better I wouldn't have done if I've done ... Ford she didn't expect it to go public but I Would have not done it\nBecause their lives have been ruined and costing buzzy for just got an alumni an award from UNC Chapel Hill for this and she got to get movies like the hills life has not been ruined or destroyed Sally world are you looking at\n'em anyway [noise] uh\n... I did and why the bulls he sends a wetter if she didn't want any of this to come out\nThis Rush Limbaugh bleed really on the E R B word\nHi I'm ... owner of blind store dot com you know I made in my life's mission to convince everyday people that measuring installing custom lines is one of the easiest do it yourself projects there is check out our new no tool cellular shades the first and only shades installed without any screws or tools you heard me right custom shades\nButter insulin without any tools I guarantee your blinds will fit around remake the free of charge you only pay shipping save up to fifty percent off any order just another code Russia checkout lines to dot com that's blinds T.

and I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had in fact from natural course of the gods now movie is amazing Cormac God's know is perhaps the most prolific through the

the Muslim resort to get more there is nothing in the world quite like one of the time resort on the west coast of Cuba overlooking the bay every visitor every check\n\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and the swerve into a truth\nExcept\nFor the very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the\nJFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow it when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting them white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe ... the left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged\nInto so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents this\nAnd by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn\nA language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test and they had to swear and plans their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here it's a Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters\nWhat they have to do was change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWas done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on on on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional to the s\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts if you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak\nEvery liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture laws and reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most thoroughly example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy the ass not by you\nIn fact the Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christie on um on poor listening to one another working out our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face that's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe a Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton or just Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrat shoved announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me my hope is my faith is that this instability this insanity this on the ...\nDemocrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh fact pro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data but\nWe're never going to get a poll of people who did approve of Democratic Party tactics techniques that poll is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back then it was quite harmful of Democrats they wouldn't run the results\nThey would get hold of Democrat leaders the media was look this is not working you guys you'd better get hold of your people to dial back the problem is Democrats can't die all these people back the Democrats don't control these left wing radicals\nThat's why you don't see any public statements of disapproval got to take a break we'll get started with ... right after we get\nBack I Want to listen to talk radio oh yard work\nTurn around and watch her show that we're not supposed to ask the question to different things Russia can't extrapolate to voter registration drives an audiences for award shows I can you people can make it up left and right I can draw on my own analogies I can ask these questions\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but that this stuff doesn't um\nIntimidate you I think I think it has it intimidated average of Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have used or how you doing\nGood well thank you long time listener first time caller thank you\nSo it was just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing\nI listen to do to last night I Can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in love that you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm being an civil to the likes of her\nShort would sure whether it be that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUm our world should be destroyed that is just is that\nIs what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nAnd we have no business [noise]\nFighting back are resisting it we deserve\nWhat we can support can go at ... dot org listening to a patriot England fifty I'm checking off or\nYou know a lot about a lot of things but when it comes to Medicare I've got
