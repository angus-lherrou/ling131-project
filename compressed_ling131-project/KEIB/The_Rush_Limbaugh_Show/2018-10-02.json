Iranians out of using it meaning it may have trouble moving their money around\n[noise] [noise] that's why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal\nIn so many ways it's a huge deal in turning the swamp upside down on the inside out and it is a huge deal for Trump\nMaking America great again putting America First and following through on a deeply deeply committed in highly touted campaign promise trade deals were among Trump's top three campaign issues\nIt's not an accident that Ninety thousand people tried to get into the trumpet Johnson county Tennessee Johnson City Tennessee after the NAFTA deal is done ... ... ... ... that the people in Washington the drive by media are totally missing this it's not sexy told them it ... it's not a big deal NAFTA trade deal yeah\nScrewed Trump for doing it but they they don't have any ability to see its connection and its relevance and its importance in Trump's supporters remaining ramped up\nAnd loyal and then there's this one more song by featuring your host CNN this happened and just before the conclusion of the previous hour I said ten minutes to one CNN aired this\nThere are some Republicans who say they have it all went down if he was defeated or the fourth or with raw that that would just jammed up Republican turnout because the quarter is their whole\nRalph and they would come rushing out his Rush Limbaugh saying don't bet on it\nIt's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republicans are going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they never voted before\nBut his that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in because if that happens tech that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed it in the Senate you think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say\nYou see what happened to Kevin off we're in the majority that we couldn't get it confirms you need to come out in ...\nHow does that work how does that work pretty good point I Do think that that's an important point that if Kavanaugh goes down it will be because moderate Republicans decided not to vote for him and that could depressed turn out in some ways that could lead to a number of people saying what's the point\nThe point I was making is and I I've been hearing this from a lot of people that if Kavanaugh goes down it's just going to fire up Trump's because Republicans were seeing trying to make it happen and if if it goes on people\nI ...\nI understand the thinking but he just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why\nDon't we have to use in order to win I never understood that\nWhy do we have to lose Kavanaugh in order to gin up turnout I depending on how it would happen I'm not sure it would have turned out anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and they go to the voters ... were the majority and we tried we tried but we couldn't get to confirm you need to vote for Russia and you need to give us more Republicans\nIn the ... there there's a disconnect there [noise] anybody\nEver heard the name of Chris Dean watcher

baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right\nSpeaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at some local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites or start everything's starting to ... to to blossom at that point but but this program nationally was still at four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the\nUh building in Oklahoma City federal building and of course uh I I was living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio this is the by the way this more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine ... the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kavanaugh I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [laughter] some public at the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing\nBut the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching on the digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kavanaugh's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says they're

Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just good flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in their lives have suffered psychological instead of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now at the mainstream of the Democratic party\nDon't doubt me on this sense of what these people in the media have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurts them to the quick\nIt disturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about it as I just did on CNN NBC News\nDesperately trying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they've been trying to convict Trump colluding with Russia\nNBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie sweat\n\nOn able to independently corroborate what makes claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw sweating Nick at parties with

and it was a college student when Kevin on his buddies were high school students everybody's asking what's a college student female hanging around with a high school a party and\nI keep going back to the gang rapes if that's what's happening these parties your lawyers sent an ass\nLawyer said that she was doing research yeah\nJulie sweating it kept going to these gang rape parties\nTo gather

know anything other than capital there's no credibility in either to sweat like\nSweating isn't credible Ford is a leader Feinstein is not credible the Democratic party is not credible the media is not credible there is no credibility on the allegation side of this entire Kavanaugh story\n\nLast night I Laura Ingraham show on Fox News\nJulie you sweat next ex boyfriend or Richard Venice see details why is the third Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable Venice says that swept Nick never mentioned having been sexually assaulted the him\nThe ex boyfriend who Julie sweat Nick at third woman to

Venice the sweat and they told him at the time I'm just going to go over there and kill you guys\nSo I think is represented by Michael ... who didn't immediately respond to the Fox news requests for

they're really vetting her or just trying to get confirmation here to add to what they want to do\nSo hate snow then says did you see Brett Kavanaugh spiking the punched and you'll see him putting

so damn desperate up one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon Whitehouse is number nine Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat\nWho on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it\nAnd the date in ... he figured this could be the date where the incident Dr foreign described happened and he thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capitalism\nSo on good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking with Sheldon Whitehouse is a Democrat Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they have been given free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday of really put the effort into it\nNow wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit with Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtles in\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen we're looking at his credibility now grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday NBC News reported that either judge Kavanaugh would people close to the judge we're in communication with his classmates\nTo get the robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying\nAbout capital perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is that the throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe's a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer yeah I'm a friday night yeah\nThere's not too many people to talk through here FBI's got a lot of weight and get this done\nThat's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target or they can catch Kevin ... in anything\nUh there's one more [noise] that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise] the question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein\nYou know this this is of leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it I remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she had it since July and she told us all about\nIt that whoever
