[laughter] how\nDid you eat they were just so blasted ... says why you did see him with his shirt off so that was good for them stay away from alcohol yeah [laughter] I Know do some really good you should see it\nUm yeah er and er it did is doing very well\nOr at least as far as the reviews go people are talking about it as a big time Oscar movie have you seen what is it first in the first man first man have you seen that I haven't um do I'm fascinated by these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding that movie ... which I mean we talked about when the story came out\nThat they didn't put the scene of them planting the flag and the moon right I'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of the story\nI mean but the the the argument was ... is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches or the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rockets and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander what's the problem\nRight it's it's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment of that movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie\nAnd it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah um but we now a nice not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and\nFirst of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they think insight you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like the just the patch or yeah which which you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you I'm not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the mood in the background later the already been planted there and they show it if somebody to avoiding the flag they just don't have that moment\nNot good enough what if those forty year old women are they like has handed a\nGhana and was there already [laughter] it is so that's kind of\nThere are a couple of bottles or start a navy might not understand that but are we not just the victim here of of\nOf the budget the outrage like it does not seem to be a thing no it most of it's not most of it's not this okay\nToday there's a tweet from Donald Trump oh did he say something crazy of course they did is a tweet from Donald Trump today we're also talking about a war in Elizabeth Warren's Cherokee heritage\nWhy why does this matter I mean you know again we have to Saudi Arabia thing going on that is much more important I mean not to mention that we're going to hit a trillion dollars in debt again\nFor this year another trillion dollars in debt there's no sign of that letting up despite the fact that we're in a good economy we're we're we're pumping out a trillion plus on the books when unemployment rate is almost at full employment\nWe're almost at the peak of our employment situation we are at a point where we are the stock market despite a couple of bad days this week a has been raging for a very long time\nOr housing prices are up everything you know everything is ... pointing in the right direction and we're still throwing a trillion dollars on the fire\n[noise] I'm just put this up to this new banner from CNN the disappearance of journalists puts spotlight on Trump's business ties can that he is because candidate Trump talked about uh uh doing business with the Saudi Arabian yes he's talked about that for very long am I\nGosh are you kidding me now the only reason why they care about the Saudi Arabians they forget about you forget about gas prices forget about the economy forget about the tech sector forget about all of that this is just another way for them to talk about Donald Trump don't play that game just don't play that game\nI Wish I cared about anything in the world as much as CNN cares about what Donald Trump tweets\nI I mean there are absolutely chemically obsessed with this meant they are it's it's incredible they're chemically addicted\nThey cannot break the smell and unfortunately the one who loses and that is that I'm\n\nMm [noise] um\nLast summer when bitcoin was down forty\nPercent and trading was about two thousand dollars are going to get to Laurie from the Palm Beach let her go to expert on everything crypto\nWrote that bitcoin would hit ten thousand dollars by the end of the year people thought he was nuts we were in the middle of a horrific a bear market but she was right it hit twenty thousand dollars well now ... saying bitcoin could be up ten times or more by the end of this year that means it could hit forty\nSo I was in dollars by Christmas I Am a skeptic but you need to understand what bitcoin is what crypto currency is and what are the triggers because this is game changing technology and life changing investment even if you put a hundred dollars in bitcoin but you have\nTo educate yourself first do that by getting my exclusive Glenn Beck crypto course from teacher right now it's smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven PTO back that's eight seven seven TBO back\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now\nNot into relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to aging exercise\n\nSo she's one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem that bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need doing expanded\nTo include in South America when other\nReason there isn't much into your DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves\nThe Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine who really injured they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that the\nStory I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA in any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten ... myth wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA\nTest and he wanted to present herb ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate the future debate\nAnd that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he kept that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this Trump is literally causing these people to lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and ... out the American left and I have\nI have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality of\nVoting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all and two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships are you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred\nSeats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election they continue\nTo lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot shouldn't run ever going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't have had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed older polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixteen elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having\nI don't care if you're a part of a right wing nothing group a left wing not you can't turn

people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us this\nDNA did not actually use samples of Native American DNA the Boston Globe quotes and make up for the dearth of Native American DNA\nDr Carlos ... use samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true is she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is the static and\nI think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every ballot they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no no that was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're\nCutting it and selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband who are assumed to be barking on what a stadium chore or yes\nBill and Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds at twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can\nDo it they're going to try to get in on it there's one thing missing\nOne key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly you know for the first term maybe he had it and they believe the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe\nWake of Donald Trump you know what this is why does it like the Democrats trying that come up with an answer to me in the first ten years of this for Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave her radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show and the media\nHighlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as the rush killer every one of them was anointed end inaugurated as\nThe Democrat that was going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it never has happened\nEvery attempt\nTo supplant take over relegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds and the one that you may think rush there are no rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the guru David analyst on the left\nWho used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he went to five thirty eight and then he went to vox back to five or five thirty eight is his company and he took it to various places\nNothing has gotten rid of Donald Trump nothing has turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration these are people who get their way every single time they target somebody for destruction\nWhenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs I'm somebody\nThere as good as gone or damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh don't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking use only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was ...\nThey didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't leave with it it was it a central part of the Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they know that ball the foreign could not pull this off under pressure\nI'm Still shocked at balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was every part of the plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe that uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either\nI don't believe that's how you talk to the balls before and you run into rather beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to talk to you you're running around the beach out there uh and she is not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed or yelled at or whatever\nUh anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the\nReal objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ...\nTo the thirties and those are the twenties then they could get rid of it they failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turns of people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching the\nMost powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat one warrants such a thing but the Democrats didn't care\nThat there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ... I'm telling you that they\nAre teetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it altogether and it's in this universe framework contacts I just\nI don't see this massive blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's gonna be a challenge for them [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible I unlike Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got ... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against them of Democrats having fewer seats electoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that rock Hussein oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American in check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke\nRaise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are close in ... has told them to go pound sand\nThat tone has told them if you're elections or that important and you're going to raise the money or self I'm going to ... ... that's the way I Want money used is the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but nice him\nHe had he wanted\nNo part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races because it was nice the\nOffice of the presidency to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with his mom didn't have confidence of coattails\nAnd that ... is not going to want to share in any of his money not being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to have to oh who's by the way what does he down seven or eight points ... uh it's not fair\nThat Beto has more than ... ... and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do [noise]\nUm yeah outlook also have the um the ... situation and there's some things about this guy but I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he has been Dr\n... let me just tell you what the drive by his purpose here is again\nThe drive by is are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump to push against murder my the way just so you know there are a couple of CNN\n... pronouncing your name 'cause show jeep because there's two genes in there\nEvery time I've heard the word the name pronounce it's always been ... ad ... pronounce his name that way Robin Leach who made a star out of ab ... is Yogi who\nWas a Saudi arms merchant and he was practically featured every other week and the lifestyles of the rich and famous his name was pronounced ...

is an app there are a number of apps one\nOf the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up

up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project verite sauce every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is is McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get\nElected we\nCan't openly said that says one of her age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff\nTalking to the on identified project ...

question about they watch the apple watch worn by ... [noise] Russia one about why fight a good question [noise] the way why fine on the apple watch works\nIs this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThe the watch is always a slave to the phone so the the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... connectivity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using ... to connect\nOr even the L T E or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by Bluetooth\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on a white flag network the\nWatch is capable of white five but only if\n\nThe iPhone that it's paired June knows that wide network\nFor example when I'm at home uh\nI leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connect via wife by\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe viable watch learns it but I still I have to manually answer\nThe why fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out there walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... he got a wife ... what the hell's going on so I checked that I found out that I have not entered the password for my wife I network on my watch\nWhat I doubt that\nYour mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi conflict\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password that phone is not going to connect to the Saudi why fighting and if the phone doesn't connect you with the watch will not\nNow if he had a history of going into that conflict with this phone and if one of the previous visit he had logged into their wife I work with a password\nThen his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered the wife I network password on his watch that is if the phone is not nearby\nI just don't think any of that happened\nI don't know how proficient this guy was with tech ... it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been logged on what the password does not mean that the watch as every device connecting\nDo a wife I'm at work half to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got really simplified beard you know you'll people may not notice it may have happened to you know let's say let's say that you are going over to uncles weeks house\nAnd uncles IQ as a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife or you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do\nIs make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that uncle leaks phone will get it alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the gas didn't say it will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them to guess that happens automatically as him I O s eleven\nYou should try to see if you don't notice\nIt's fascinating it's it's it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that ... would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates ... on his watch even if it was already done on his phone you would have needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife wide network or access it\nIf he done that if his watch works on why fight in that conflict than he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\nOne of the car ... wife I Know it it it it it because he's probably be out of range for it but but it would still need the password still need\nA [laughter] well I don't know if they would say no or not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this visit was probably will find daddy okay who knows but I doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um\nLook get another example of try to explain it you go to a city and you get an a car picks you up at the airport or whatever in the car service has wife I got it it's just a hot spot\nThe driver gives you the password if you're not sure you log into what you're watching is not logging on to the network your ... your watch is connecting to the phone", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "16"}
