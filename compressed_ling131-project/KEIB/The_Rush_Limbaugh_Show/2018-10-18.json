T. E. or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple in well actually uh fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could take it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operated which they'll get emails and messages and they're recording your workout data and so forth if you could receive a Celtic we didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch failed to do that just ceased to be a slave to the phone the other two ways or blow to and why\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch and data can leave a watch\nYou take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watched they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in the car in the parking lot at the consulate there was only one way that watch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why fi and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to it this week by design it doesn't have much range sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against other nations being able\nTo monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just like there's no ... that couldn't happen so the only other way would be why\nBut that one only work if\nThe wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been entered\nAnd the wife I connection on one just because the phone connects to why when the phone does the watch automatically connects but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because of the phone it's parents who uses it then\nLike if you're at home you're ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range\nIf you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that he was probably know to do it um\nI don't know that they wouldn't give them the password how'd he get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't want to find the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted it up to iCloud\nIs just so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nPushing that that recording exist that it's somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish\nSilly that markets are having another volatile session today a number of events appear to be contributing to this volatility\nFirst ... minutes from the feds ended up September meeting were published yesterday afternoon while on the whole these minutes for positive an upbeat about the U.S economy there was concern about the potential for growth to over shoot\nThe fed focused their thoughts on two main concepts one being the long term federal funds rate and when there are no longer in an accommodate of posture given the lack of precision in these numbers the fed opted to remove the word accommodate it from the press release about rate that being said they view conditions in economy as a combination for growth\nAnd should expect that growth continue for some time into the future a couple of fed governors expressed concern for the economy to overheat recording the fed to take a more restrictive policy stance secondly the u._k. is prime minister met with either leaders and another attempt to set the final plans for the u._k. exit from the European Union\nUnfortunately this meeting ended and another stalemate further concerns without a follow up meeting has not been set despite the u._k. ... at the end of march\nNearly five months from now gladly trade tensions continue to weigh on the markets the latest step in the saga has been the U.S has withdrawn from international postal treaty historically this treaty is offered this kind of postal rates for developing nations to ship small package good with China identified as a developing nation this treaty benefit of the country with lower global shipping rates\nThe U.S his departure from the treaty could result in a significant rise the cost of small shipments from China to the U.

people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel report well maybe the headline is true that the Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case I'm a\nSuburban woman [noise] thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut\nThis election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past\nAnd have voted Republican know how important I just don't ... I don't think the media's learned this lesson yet ... this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to you know Louis maybe holding elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they assumed this has it dead zip Trump's finished this has to be and not even the Access Hollywood video in it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the hill dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop the onslaught this is the caravan that's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador are saying that they have almost no control over their population\nI'm watching the Democratic party land because they want to open borders an existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S\n[noise] these people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there\nAnd maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal\nNon citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico right before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for this that somebody\nThey have to eat they have to be drinking things they've\nGot to be using facilities somebody\nHas to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say of the midterm election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop so\nWhat's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's got to be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start and by the Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the that's the game plan\nBut I'm struggling to see other than just the general chaos it's creating them and maybe the Democrats think that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump the Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\n\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting him back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nBut afternoon

always told me to call you I should call you a call you for finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up the south America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases
