and I said this Friday\nAnd even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\nThere is not a single thing in a decent and just country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by

small\nPortion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal democratic presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively otherwise they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America they have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the\nPoint what they believe in the idea is they have\nMust be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests it's the same\nReason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nYou've Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexandria or gift you could pass who's ... on display in a left his district to New York is harmless\nBut you'll put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that sounding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and besides you they're sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot refute\nThis everything they want everything\nThey have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to

it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball before that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sun is in a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there's no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to what happened\nA rush to begin to your show you or you had a rhetorical question about a dozen Democrats really believe in this this new tactic with mom\nAnd I mean the Democrats there and insurgency they've become a political insurgency and says you know and I certainly these are defeated they just change tactics\nAnd the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate our youth that someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for\nOh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp through cannot who has puts them on the on the final Republican\nUh ... true true but\nMaybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get on the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told that's either side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working\nBlue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nMy scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this it ought to be that people can't wait to go\nThis month just gone for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats think they're going to have to turn out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country of except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event had happened and what twenty nine days it it happened a\nTrue yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shake the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by then actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet [laughter] I just have to chuckle\nUm\nBut I can I can see what the passage of pie you cannot maintain\nThis river passion for long nobody can welded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm I'm saying it's it's understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade there's

with the bill Clinton's victims because there were members of his own party\nAnd that's the sickness of all this and I think the senators and this whole process now have perfect\nWeapon use ah and I

need a proper a member of their own party\nYeah let's see they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there because they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy but the fact of the matter is and I will say it again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault\nAs evidenced by your recitation of the facts of what happened to women who accused Bill
