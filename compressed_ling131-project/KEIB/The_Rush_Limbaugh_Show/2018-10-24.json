it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis limited terms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly\nWhat what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on a sea of Fox Business network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning\nThe Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pick up according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five and a half so two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift\nIn just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there\nIsn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and we only Democrats\nStanding the generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nBut this cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters not the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply\nIn the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up\nOr at least some of it\nIt's a good reminder that even mid October surveys could miss late change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about at Bloomberg's a recorded credit card and I could go either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go either ... what is this an decision all\nOf a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nPolls couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it\nThen when the polls have to be shown to be correct so they still have their reputations all of a sudden it could be really\nReally close much closer than we ever ever new it's a cycle and you can predict\n\nEver find yourself missing

and time again there's simply no load that they want to do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis was going to be instant fodder

telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their hands and they believe it and they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes\nIn more

of people want\nIs a big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big\nGuy won't tell the truth about it is the big one\nBut I think this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change is wrong because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nInto positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and uh and other things is willingly a desirous of seeking them\nAnd it's a [noise]\nIn in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interests and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is ahead of just ... fifty two to forty six among the light ... voters and he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence\nAnd it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum with this clear to lead as is overall edge in public polling why do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so ... is a character he

over their Medicare for all he believes in a guaranteed national income these these kinds of things that if ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy\nBut\nWho is ... is a lot of people may not know much about Ron's defenses so let me step in here and tell those of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is Rhonda\n... and Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general\nHe has a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he
