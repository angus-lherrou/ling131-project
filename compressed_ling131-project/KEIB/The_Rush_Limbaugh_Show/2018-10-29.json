link who ever committed the bad indeed do the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump blame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump and frankly\nI'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and it no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory to say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats and left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they liked her doctor keep their plan they get get get to end up their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not\nCalled out not reported and then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets that\nIs why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stopped in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and it's so predictable because they hate the president will do\nAnd then we can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and\nIf it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person\nThat we're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link it to ...\nWell I I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nThough whether we can even get away from it from a Weber extreme weather happens\nWhich is to have trust and not offering

this works is [noise]\nUh thirty six year old allegation can be made for which there is no evidence for which for supposedly witnesses camp even place themselves at the place because the victim doesn't know where it happened doesn't uh when it happened but it becomes real and we got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got at Kavanaugh exposed to sit\nBack and just take it he's just she those are the old rules of Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to not make waves sit there and take it and that's how\nResponsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not that Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people were being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down at organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts that are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll liked it and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just this is just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's wife has ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nThey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nAre probably the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down to one\nThing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have a mayor who's very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control law cancer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's\nAbout something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't pass it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that you can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in East Africa but but but but but what we're all for freedom if we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked a\nOn Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the court and joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's for air force one is parked before Trump takes the helicopter to get on board air force one way is going to travel a reporter\nSaid Mr President do you think you need to revisit seem\nSo a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill and the first question\nA drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that and all the other things an anti\nSemitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd then on to tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nThe worst part is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until retailer started calling them silent crime is\nWhy people who have life like have light flock to protect

photograph of Obama yeah you know with that world class Jew hater\nOr lower tier cannot wear\nWhat they say when you ask them that\nYou know [laughter] I don't what what do you think they're going to say rush what do you what do you think they're going to say that I can say damn well that's\nRight and they're never going to they're never going to they're not that Obama was their guy Obama was who they think they are\nRight in ... well spoken a highly educated reasonable academic intellectual\nI'm an in look in the leftist world the only African Americans\nWho can do anything wrong are conservative African Americans they're not going to get on Obama for hanging around ... minds like Farrakhan agenda Reverend Jackson Al Sharpton are busy promoting all those people\n\nThey feel sorry for them to get right down to brass tacks I feel sorry for them they think that because of the ancient history of America with slavery discrimination and all that ... that that really we we we can't\nHold them accountable we may have excuses you know we can look the other way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was foreign count standing right next to him all of the Aretha Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him\nAnd many drive by news organizations cropped Farrah Khan out of the photo\nWhen they sent it down their news wires so they know but it's ... this is the point we have a two tiered justice system and we clearly have a two tiered political system we have criminalized\nRight wing or conservative Republican politics and policy as at the same time exempted\nA from any criticism or criminality um most\nOf the policies

president and condemning all hate crime\nTragic attack on the Pittsburgh tree of life synagogue just two days ago searches a stark reminder of the need to protect all Americans against hate crimes\nPreach on that and I and I just I couldn't take it anymore you know it it's not even my religion and\nNo way that limited by what was that rabbi conditioning what was he was he suggesting that the congregation as Jews had signed on to the Al Gore climate change premise that that was part of\nNot not the Jewish faith but then if you didn't describe George ... maybe you wouldn't be welcome\nI don't think he ... he he when he was a fostering an atmosphere where he wouldn't be welcomed but I I think you know\nIt's just the pilot us as they should have everything right that wouldn't have happened in the entire time I grew\nUp I mean time I hit it maybe it's because I I mainly grew up in military and I got I got the airport that there was never politics never came current events dead but not politics\nLet me ask you this is like me ask you this up in your opinion and you said you've got to fix\nEr into the Hollywood types in Europe parents that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\n\nWhen they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't put it I said that they were I mean because what I\nSay that yes he has a lot of a lot of a lot of them also tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think as a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThird willing they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not\nUnderstand how a liberal Jews like the New York times\nOwnership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is this it it it it it's it's the Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment\nAmong Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal people scratch their heads and don't quite understand that\n'cause it's a ... because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if it's a religion in time the religion yeah\nBecause you can't separate the Jewish state from my religion I don't think you can and it's you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation\nWith liberal and Israel comes out now when I said this flame or I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside the religion that's big\nI mean the the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavor [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used to I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian Tito um I don't\nEven necessarily being seeing Islam but I mean you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I got\nThis ... that's exactly right I was just wondering is this all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there is no\nUltimate power that can meet out\nApproval to disapprove of one's accidental one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so you have this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else\nThat you say that you are there's all the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism your writers it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah I I I don't I don't\nFeel like that there's a ... million people out there targeting a Jews in a way that they would want to go shoot up a thing that I think that this is these are isolated incidents in this country because the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere\nElse and I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a\nPerson who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much\nRachel I prefer this racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this\nYear I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have a entirely different bits why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people\nIn fact I think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is the attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people do abandon Trump and it has been happens to these two events come along and they but ah this is that this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting stirred\nThe president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is Washington disillusion Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern government as an agent of power to enforce punitive\nOh yeah I don't think Trump's responsible for a ... looking and there was a murder we didn't say that no well we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for
