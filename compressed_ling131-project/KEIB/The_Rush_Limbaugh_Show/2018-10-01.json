consideration for the new FBI probe Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh also insisting he's not limiting the scope of the review just deferring to the Senate\nThere's even a little story that's developed about the um her use of safe way\nThat she shopped in safe way a lot and that was new and the reason the the theory behind that\nIs mark judge wrote a book as part of his therapy for alcohol and drug abuse he was told to write a book it was it was supposed to be a fictional\nBook it was a it was a it was an an a and then I attempt to help him through his\nProblems it was not a memoir\nAnd in this book it talks about safe way a lot and he works there didn't work there so she automatically places herself with a Safeway where he is\nRachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\n\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here I I it it is devastating be inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she set in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea that she was afraid to fly and yet\nHere she is vacationing all over the world how did she get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans are not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein working to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she's the last\n\nShe's not the least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is automatically\n\nSaid to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what happened\nAll those years ago you could say yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that\nI don't think for me\nI don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its

Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty

Republicans\nWho are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought Kevin all was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\nWhat the credibility of their testimony does it appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should assigned to the high court in

fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jumped from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent in a hypothetical question if the FBI after\nA week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that\nBut now we've got a call me entering the picture now we've got a call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it

appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking on that uh there's no better way to um motivate group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin either basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we showed up and sixteen and voted Trump then\nOf that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in midterms are going to they're going to have an adverse effect if they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire\nOn the Democrats are motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again\nFor Trump in twenty twenty

is talking to see be Yemen political corresponded David Brody about all this and she says well we know the Democrats already\nBeen really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized they could get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp or my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it is going to be real tough for the Republicans actually of capital is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the plural evangelical base into GOP based I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so what I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow look you can't blame David Brody for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the\nDrive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by it's any good when\nThe drive by here me you're predicting Republican do they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh those Republicans going to lose ... capital not confirmed that production was based\nAt a specific point in time on the if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that won't happen but once this began to unfold I retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here\nBut of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make a case here is one more\nA bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent

that's gone sour is that incident\nWell could be I mean the but the point was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we got a poll in June or a polling mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything because it's not won the election is and I said the\n... the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that in July August September\nA

because all the Democrats won a year's delayed delayed delay\nBut my only point was that those polls in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things are going to happen much closer to

the oval office was during a\nAnnouncement ceremony for a new trade deal in ... getting rid of it brand new trade deal the drive vice were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA\nStarted entertaining the are the questions and what we have one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin on things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago has you know there are a lot of them are repression polls polls that are aren't very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation of a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's been out of bed statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one is law school at Yale and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay\n[noise] ...\nThis whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee voted eleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not going to vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\n\nThat NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI skull because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI and it's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out off some\nDonald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation so Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at okay\nThank you Mr herself and needs to go two weeks ago to wait for them so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC's white course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that that they hold on to it till friday and or are are are do they move\nOn it will just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was Richard they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why did they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing you know a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um [noise]\nAudio soundbite number thirty reporter about

that that that they run a fake news story NBC does\nClaiming Trump is limiting the investigations ... not that's fake news so then they've got it on record Trump not limiting invested in which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats

some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed delay and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nAs somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides have needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with the woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller they stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still
