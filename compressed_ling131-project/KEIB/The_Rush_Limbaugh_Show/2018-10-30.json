you're not going to realize that until it's too late that's why lifelike\nIt needs to be addressed every effort that Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere\nAnd yet we have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may go\nWith their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me just say this just being John Doe upset Trump's base that the\nImplication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again a classic expression or\nIllustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of Donald Trump\nButton back we'll get to more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red way but I said I Hope you're right but let\nMe let me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairmen and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that\nMakes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buyers are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit at home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house\nAnd the Senate\nMy forecast for the twenty eighth congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected\nTo office and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my ... great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative here a long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained\nUh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity among democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement reading\nPill movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red\nPeel a movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing\nYou know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference weren't consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in an electorate that's unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in in the\nPast question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive buys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations\nAh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats and the media think it is a problem\nThere's talk all\nThey're real people being real you know a lot of that going around right now real people actually been nice to each other certainly not a lot of that going around\nDave Ramsey show today has three on the patriots am eleven fifty\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nFox News I'm Chris foster the

that Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's what they said they were talking and it blew up in their faces and this continues to too\nBut let's get the birthright citizenship this I think as a follow want it to Donald Trump following through on\nOne of the primary commitments he made as a candidate which I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country but primarily\nWith Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration and actually both parties have\nTo the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them are both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes results\nAnd in some cases it's\nEven worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country overthrowing from the days of its founding\nOut to the left America is it legitimate to a gym morals it's in decent because we were a slave nation\nAnd we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers there were no founding mothers only founding fathers and their bunch of white privilege rich white guys they

it was added after\nThe civil war its purpose was to overrule the\nDred Scott decision which was a horrible Dred Scott sanctions slavery Roger than it was the chief justice for ever immortalized in infamy\nIt held at black slaves were not citizens so Congress got into gear and pass the fourteenth amendment guaranteed that freed\nSlaves would have all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized\nIn the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states added up a state where he may resign which means the draft or is that the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents is so important quote\nThis meeting the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person who was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nIt was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants there was an Eighteen\nEighty four case elk versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not even couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans because they were subject

all changed\nIn the Nineteen sixties concomitant with Senator Kennedy\nWanting to re oh we had shut down all immigration from Twenty one sixty five along comes Senator Kennedy in a pre Chappaquiddick

S. when their parents are non citizen the American civil liberties union out with a statement the president\nAnd it's the same thing that they did on Trump's travel ban and so forth but still despite all that I did get smart to make it an issue the Web can sit out there in the ring\nYour hands over oh my God Trump is just trying to roll up his base it's colder winning an election\nWe're ... we've gotten to a dangerous point here where ever left refuses to accept election outcomes and folks that cannot leave the anything good that has always been the glue that's held us together\nI I ... I I have at times I've marvel that this country has held together the way it has for his many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper in the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document as what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing but we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason\nIt make it up well it was stolen Russia's this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm In junior high intramural football in softball nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just nope no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\n\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised\nCobbled they had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents teaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not\nPrepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses and we have a political party that's behind all of this\nAnd right now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election that is on going\nAnd now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand who Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I I think reasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ... Facebook ad comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein\nThis is from what I'm calling the news civility and alleged tone it down stack\nThe Democrats and the left and the drive by telling everybody we need to tone it down they told Trump you need to tone down their rhetoric dude you're causing all these people engage in violence Trump said I thought I hadn't turned it down if you need me to turn it back up I Will they went bonkers\nSo here comes a left wing billionaire Tom ...\nWho is one of these environmentalist\nWackos who hopes to make a killing him this this fraudulent hoax of man made climate change\nDire is running a Facebook ad campaign comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein the ad features a three minute long video that accuses the president of following dictator's playbook\nModeled by tyrants like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Kim Jong only in North Korea as well as Saddam Hussein ... describes Trump as a malignant\nNarcissistic and claims he is perpetuating systemic massage the\nVideo claims that Trump's support for a border wall and attacks on the media make him comparable dictators\n\nDictators not attacked the media they own the media\nDictators don't spend their time ripping the media because they are\nThe media Trump visited dictator [noise] not even close to it seems like only yesterday\nDone at the dry buys her blasting Trump for tweeting that's dire comes off as a crazed stumbling woman [laughter] yet here he is\nWashington Post yesterday Trump mocks Democrat mega donor Tom's dire the target of a pipe bomb as stumbling lunatic and now here comes Tom's dire bumbling along like a lunatic comparing Trump Trump to a bunch of tyrants\nJeff Flake said yesterday but it's on the white point Trump will change his rhetoric but elected officials shouldn't call him out\nAnd its supporters as being out of bounds you elected officials they'll continue to appear what the president at rallies where lock her up chants are encouraged and routine and phrases like the president is using I can imagine\nAs an elected official attending a rally like that and not stand up afterwards with me for having said don't do this don't do this\nLake was on Arizona NPR station on Monday saying elected officials and got to abandon Trump\nBill Nelson running for the Senate in Florida compares\nThe U.S political climate to Rome Wanda before the genocide there\nWhen the place gets so tribal that the two tribes won't have anything to do with each other that jealousy turns into have said Nelson\nWe saw what happened to those Hutus and the Tutsis in Rwanda it's turned into a genocide a million people hacked to death within a few months we've got to watch what's happening here well\nGot to give him his due senator Nelson those Democrats best I guess is concern should be taken\nA bat synagogue is saying some of the most intelligent stuff of anybody a particularly in the heated passionate moment but yeah that you're you're exactly right at a local media doing the same\nLocal media is doing the same some of the national that local leaders are doing and why should anybody the guy who did it was shot and they're not say anything about that guy we we need to change [noise] I might be waiting for what\nDo you think you need to do day event in order to prevent this from happening again what what do you Dave in Pittsburgh need to do to make sure that some other lunatic doesn't act like this\nWell I used to be an armed security officer many years ago\nNo no I'm I'm a cancer you need to renounce Trump you need to\nPronounce your support for Trump that's what they're trying to get you to do don't do it that's what they're trying to get you to do\nIs your terrorist cell living in terror no this word from New York Times to jihad is everywhere is your safe house not that safe if you want your sleepers\nEver find yourself missing your favorite T.

blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah ... ... ... it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirtieth amendment that about slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are closed that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays per article for section two claws one\nSo after that the ... were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio and he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few a few years later and you can find that\nIn a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent\nThe fourteenth amendment was never intended to confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents\nIt was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods are Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians is that\nThey do but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western\nCivilization that's what's different now there's no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company that are we going to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being Senate that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again in South Hampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it will get their it'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nIt's more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and we had a far greater distribution of capitals that would be fine and dandy but the care of and I don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones and it was about door or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but\nThere isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries they're they're dictatorship some one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dumped cause if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's ... [noise] we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here 'cause that's these people are capable being hired anywhere\nYet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk political theory and economic theory it makes\nSense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know a wise or George Soros I think George Soros his name is ... and like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is\nAnd their purpose is to destabilize the United states the purpose is not to improve life for these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done do it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump into advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent\nVoters a jam in Madison, Virginia great to have your what is your next on the E R B network high\nHigh yeah fresh uh ten years ago my husband and I adopted for Hispanic sister\nWho were in foster care and we have had him for a couple of years and then they cannot fact option their parents go back to the Gulf of Mexico they had flipped over the border at least for high illegal a one party at them each time they had children here too and then they come back to my left on the ground and came back I\nHad two more went back and got him a long story short is that even today I had you know they were\nCame to us thanking Trump was horrible and that that wasn't he was telling them all back home and and you know they love Trump and they think this has got to stop and have an escape because my father's I'm president twenty eight years with his\nMother fled to Mexico not because I'm so they think they're kind of hair cut off all crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just said\nEverything Trump can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way you know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and they let her across they sent the other sixteen teams with our back\nOn my stomach so they can't say we don't have heart they do see a situation they know need help but you know even Hispanic girls that\nThought Trump was horrible that he was to send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what are the country\nWell we'll take them you know whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's\n[noise] um\nOnce you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions\nOf what the United States purpose in the world is and what we all and so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't anyway appreciate\nThe jam thanks much will take a break and be back\nTo Russia\nI'm ...

Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because\nThere was a direct connection between political speech and violence that's a very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack\nWe always ask what radicalized than what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists from there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists you cannot divorce the actions of the second to the ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat smacks boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic terrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric\nThat you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have an a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day it was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to the among preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this\nThe moms are telling people what to do and how they're doing they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs they're being nobody on our side to this is ...\n\nIs the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable\nTo dispatch Trump and it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up the Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you know what it is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this program\nDating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I ... valley and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in\nThe presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along all I did was repeat\nAll of us had been saying to each other but you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laughed at or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what not because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance stay in and out all of a sudden started learning\nRight you find that you might be that kind of like it was\nLike look what words ... the ...

Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something Fox\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is\nGas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accept it and it's this arrogance and just supremacy their superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you\nHave a the synagogue shooting ... the obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like\nThey are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSpent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm and on many people\nStill does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris ...
