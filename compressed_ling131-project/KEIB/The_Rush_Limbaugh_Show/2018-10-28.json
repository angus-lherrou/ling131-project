normalization kids go to ... dot com slash radio that's British Bulldog Tom flash rage\nIn the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to trying to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be\nCovering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's were at this stage\nIn the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just resigned themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't\nThink anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure\nThat was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling David is to just that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled prompt\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want to last and so he did what he could change it I I Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs let them still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them if they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters begin to I don't doubt\nIs the right where they would be my only disappointment particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\n\nSomebody has to be making this happened folks we're talking\nWe we've got how many two thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern border\nOf the United states assistance in Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start\nWalking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people decide to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nI guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the ... in the street and they get maps and San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human PC\n[noise]\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how\nMany miles a day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over three months\n\nAnd the objective is to show up right as the\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to lower he'll talk about Jeff he's talking to Jeff and I won't even know who is twice who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions of big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this Argo left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprise as its eventual anything but I think this is the left behind it\nFor a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\nNothing short of Americans think that mine why this loop of MSNBC and all the rest of the\nCNN Washington Post New York times demise of employees they think that they're smart when they talk about the president has to be removed by the twenty Fifth Amendment they think they're savvy when they discuss the coming fascism in this country they're hysterical in muscle [noise] but they're also getting dangerous and they are really destroying some of what holds us all together in\nThis box exit from all night and I've gone the patriots am\nThe Fox news on Debbie hand like I could eat today mourns the eleven victims who were killed or the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nThis morning the county medical examiner he released the names of these individuals in for a lot of folks here these are people that the new in this tragedy is hitting home that much more today their ages range from fifty forty Ninety seven most of them were from the Pittsburgh area\nBoxers Garrett Kenny phase or stay on the Florida Man arrested for a nationwide bomb scare appears in court tomorrow\nThe suspected of mailing fourteen ... pipe bombs inside each one addressed to a prominent Democrat Trump critic for recipient of Trump's indignation the FBI friday described the packages and I ... inside as not host devices Fox's ...\nThis is ...

Limbaugh kicking off a brand new week of broadcast excellence here an eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to [noise] one more of an Louie\nGohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply conservative violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the\n[noise] the details on that story are from the uh oh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nHow was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening especially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who when their right\nMind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this would want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night pomp pale who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals one of the world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting in one of the reasons this company is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything\nTo the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best are being driven solely by emotion govern stolen by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that common\nFrom having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences there is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing\nMales will just to raise the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost\nAs an entitlement and we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any room breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nI'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN playing\nAn impartial sound bite me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that with all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence from up by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and it's called\nAn invasion and saying that we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion\nAnd I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military and because of the positive comments out of ... that normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stopping invasion from another country so\nThere was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military they may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is it in what is what a seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and laughter seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms I joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized as the border if they\nBomb rushed the border like down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring them back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is the by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own he leads to put everybody else's but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get away with it off\nTo Russia and by the myth work\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well made take cigars for example the details are what matter a proper assembly properly rolling the cigar is essential for a good draw the feel and to look at a rapper has to be just right\nWell details also matter when it comes to home security and simply say home security pays attention to the details it's evident in their use of tech\nAnd craftsmanship their focus on creating the most reliable security for your family shows in the details simply safe centers are small they don't destroy the look at your home the system is easy to set up a news\nThey made sure that it works even in the event of power outages are downed wires and unlike other home security companies simply safe never asked you to sign a contract\nSee how good simply safe really is right now get ten percent off your system at simply safe usa dot com that simply safe usa dot com ten percent off\nSimply safe usa dot com you're\nListening to the page I Am a living\n[noise]\nTo know what's good for you which is how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left it's how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton the deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them they've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack\nPlans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past and kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise\nTo do this that or the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the\nMedia they've had Republicans who are elected properly intend to David they've been able to persuade you of the various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nTheir Jim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside and just roaring\nAnd cheering and having the best time they've had in a week or longer and he can't stand it after all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard\nWork trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling for the lives and you keep falling\nFor the hate yeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at\nThe CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer as afternoon show at some conventions setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to have it anymore but\nWhat is troubling is to look behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes and he does it I think because it's still works it's still riles people up that divides us horribly\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake out who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really\nTroubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump is he's pretty smart Trump knows when he's probably knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're ... and ... knows that you'll fall for anything and so Trump\nIs ... is working is spend golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers hey resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are\nWhich takes me to want peace that I have ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science ... Williams cited his work countless times on this program\nOver the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... way\nBack when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting that the coming midterms are fascinating\nFor a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues\nThe economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased prince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this ... says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they are painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what you hate about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist I Know\nRight to alert or at ... they do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his on willingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectuals\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nRefusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all she does\nYou have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life and short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself\nIn vents and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocratic Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate\nHis certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious\nProblems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin they can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up we'll get another lying to themselves about the future\nYou're going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump\nNancy Pelosi can't help herself she's bragging talking about the subpoena power is that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump and the people that work for him brought up under investigation for two years instead of real life on the ground improving the way it is\nIs this what the Democrats in media really think it's just what they are left wing candidates really believe\nThat the American people are so filled with range Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come up at Trump cheated against Hillary with Russia they're still obsessed with this stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen from them\nAnd now it's time to make it All right\nAnd they are convinced did you\nWhat Trump investigated too and they're just fit to be tied to heaven persuade you to join them so now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of angry deranged\nLunatics in order to get what they the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying\nTo create right in front of our eyes\n...\nEver find yourself missing your favorite T.

Ohio David Europe first today high\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening\nTo NPR and Steve as a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a\nPersonality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order Johnson the stench of snow about is making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whenever it is for them but it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people but it's good for them but when it's locked it when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nBut there's you know thousands of feet on the line well and he couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go back\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what to enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it\nThey can [noise] that\nYou know for we've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I registered NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said oh for the audience and and that happens when I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA buck but of course NPR's not call it a mob\nNPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people we're being\nLed to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar torn\nPoverty and a ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings just it just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know as obese screwed Trump Trump's Hitler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that\nTrump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about this\nSuffering and denied entry in this kind of thing but but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\nWay most Ramos or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell them no but what is it your ... right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it\nI don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past and he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remains strongly favored to win back the house overhead and TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats booked\nAsked if the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] white\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before\nThe caravan most congressional Democrats on immigration as a loser for them\nA\nMemo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border\nAnd threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nWhat she has doubled down on by the way so this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up in groups or two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worry that this is going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense that makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta put yourselves in their shoes everyday\nThey've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times how Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous the Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and\nI got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house they have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed\nBecause none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're out there which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really bumped\nThrough Russia's always at work but he I have never closes

didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise] I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing to show me right\nSo Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill his showing and come back here and they start sending out bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn end to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy rains is is [noise] I mean [noise] the elevator doesn't go to the top floor right to say is an order of fries short of a Happy Meal why would someone\nSmart enough to make functioning mailed mom's actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\nAnd ... and and so close to win the election what kind of food would do something like this\n\nIs a smart bomb maker [laughter] if somebody really really good at making bombs have left\nThis much\nDoes he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think and all candor to what's going on barring a the\nRevelation of what really this is about if we ever learn mad\nI think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on you you watch Kavanaugh blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you\nIf all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of humble like mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what couldn't you'll be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans that other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republican sue\nOther words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt is brandy hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that\nBackfired and leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you can not believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it okay let's get\nSome of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what\nWhat real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the\nTop up here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they had a real clear politics and analyzing it's not\nThere is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building\nHe says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it and they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats\nPicking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half states which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesize and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nIt was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it\nYeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's a but it did credit card they could go either direction Democrats were so big and they could lose big it going to ... what what is all those indecision all of a sudden\nVersus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nSo they still have that reputation as all of a sudden\nIt could be really really close much closer than we ever ever new it's a cycle and you can

question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixty midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how how many are there are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterm the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar\nExcept they are today I mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour\nThird team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what what if there isn't a whole\nLot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nMy tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons art anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now at Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger the wife and I remember hearing is not sitting there just just to past it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what in form\n... and a educated suspicion about this

where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information it's just not out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers and certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and Mike video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do\nSomething that's well it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that\nWay it doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be\nInstant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican\nOur conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around would\nIt make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us but the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember\nThey believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around and you've got this you've got this this\nThis mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats
