couldn't just wait\nThey couldn't just wait for the announcement in the video tape from the oval office where she in Trump ...\nBright yellow chairs by the fireplace couldn't wait no adding to fill that time\nWas speculation and that's when people really get dumb when all kinds of wild guess speculation that for people to show their smarts folks\nThe ads were all these animals and commentators

be sensitive on and not one that he wanted to push as allies in Britain and France and Germany or the whole thing states have a one sentence Nikki Haley has been a source of comfort so if you're one

this season broadcast journalist but I'm Sorry\nThis is so full of it let's go back to the top of his son but on the issues that all buys a one of the street Trump be tough on in particular Russia because that's the one that he seems to be sensitive on and not one but he's one of the push\nAs allies in Britain and France and Germany the bowling states have all wanting to be tough\nHas it every

Angela Merkel for making a deal a side deal at the G ... with the Russians\nHave forgotten that it was Donald Trump who was tough on the Russians ended it was Angela Merkel of made a side\nDeal with them for natural gas and it was Donald Trump that could not believe it and called her out on it and suggested that she couldn't have purchased natural gas from any of her allies in the G twenty to G. A. G.

puppet quite the contrary but you wouldn't be able to convince nic Robertson of that\nOne oh they got these ideas in their head and Trump and in Russia's got together they stole the election remember Hillary Trump is a Russian storage Trump has money because the Russians sought to what Trump falls Russia because of that Trump therefore soft on Russia\nNow Nikki Haley is leaving and that means nobody's left to be tough on Russia and our allies are scared to death as a total one hundred percent front to back top to bottom crock folks guarantee our allies\nAre probably happiness you Nikki

and\nExplaining the divide that exist in the country specifically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country surviving as founded we're under a solved it has never been worse\nThan a minute the civil war but but those were different circumstances\nA that was a specific argument\nAbout\nCultural things regarding slavery but any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America as mound\nSome people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I I've uh just sort of evolved here into a position where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bells and may be present some\nSolutions but after I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to her body what I think the real\nThreats that we face are so that's coming up as the program unfolds back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing to Kevin ... on the half of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd the Kavanaugh episode codified is exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limits on how low they will go on how good braved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality in all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point would be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention or whether it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nI Am so ancient history as the if they've not been taught it or they don't know\nSo the the closer to the president you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my\nThoughts [noise] but they don't for folks we are not legitimate in their eyes ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledgment\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in a capital hearings everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable staying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThat and that's what we'll do\nNow these are Senate races it's interesting in the CNN polling data the generic ballot I I'm just going to tell you don't get dispirited by this because it's it's a it's it's CNN\nBut on the generic ballot in a CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground but in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening now to plus Thirteen that I I just I\nMaybe it's my desire maybe it's my hope but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus all the way the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of balance that it makes sense that way\nI just I I find it really hard to believe that after the last\nTwo to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent wants to Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\nI Know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThat the first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the Jim this is standard operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of all elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six was an election certainly to the exception two thousand\nTwo as well but I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially\nI and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive\nRealization that the Democrats are they answer what ails America\nNot the dry buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way but in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen margin advantage but then you look at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by a twenty eight point margin\n\nEven though the Democrats on the surface would seem to have public opinion on their son ...\nSays the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved of how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved\nOf further breakdown\nFinds that fifty eight percent of independents disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compared to thirty percent who approved other\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by and narrower fifty three of the\nThirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independents disapproving ... did it\nYou know big ... [noise] I\nCan't prove anything all I have to go on um experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct I'd just died everybody\nBelieves this blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story that\nDrudge for example links links to on his page is a story\nOf the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\n\nWhere Republicans supposedly thinking the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp lowers your I mean you hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what what [noise] [noise]\nYeah well yeah I'd like to get an individual Paul's visual nine percent of their nine the advantage even after the worst happens of all that that's getting into the into the ... I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having a dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm only ... people to get everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at the American way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that\nWay now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentlemen that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not dumped me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interested in\nAnd would always say a variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to get all of people out of the country they don't like it's not that it not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't\nShe couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows but\nSeriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy envy\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed it upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get him\n... with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this then I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... that somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democratic side has even given it\nA prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide stadium\nToured taking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this fall\nIt's going to

the two hundred eight team needed to win control\nThis is what you were just telling me right and\nIt you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTo resign seats firmly are leading Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this\nIs a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this this this is [noise] and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans you know I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington to live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to print nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's going to be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this guy\nWith the party now the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed there just go for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching this this last week was premier week for all the new network prime time shows I think it was
