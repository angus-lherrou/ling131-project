you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what are you see\nWhat I've observed a president who examine leadership he condemned the attack he called for unity and then you had a response from the liberal media today ... the president\nNation instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president's\nLeadership yesterday called for the country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time for family and the president shameful I Will add that the New York times today tell us to publish an article that depicted the assassination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from the thigh convene deliver and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fictional piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nHanding a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun\nDoes that go off and someone nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine\nThe times runs this story and they excuses by saying well we must publishing stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump and ... what does that got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there is not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back and Donald Trump needs to change it Donald Trump didn't meanwhile\nThey can call him a Nazi they can call him a Hitler or they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controlled ... that's ... that it has rally that he was poking fun\nAt the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to the audience you know what I'm thinking and then this morning he tweeted that it was CNN fall which basically is I can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short skirt has\nBeen completely inappropriate saying that CNN and was responsible for that to get to the fake news that they're spreading this is one fault but the arranged maniac that offending those\nType of hope of all let me just add a van and that's why they want to be on the record of Latin python showed up and now I'm not comfortable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth than anyone an anchor on that network indoors to play in Central Park depicting the assassination the president\nSaying that the leader right now\nYou heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record\nSaying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about ... like\nBlaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um\nThe conversation continues here now you'll hear the senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than happen if our thing for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal for anyone who got him some a lot about the\nLast what about the languages I\nFast time than trying to cut hair modeling Brennan\nAnd CNN had a choice yesterday he always thought the president come out saying is abhorrent what America stand for black you know if I Want to see an anxious to chat with can blame it on the president can blame it on Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move at Fort Worth it for that fight if they took the low road President Trump put the highlights what Clinton said last week we cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hand here yet on a top actually\nTrying to blame all of this on Trump and of course using this I'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she is on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears river just a bit to talk about the care of him because I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there\nJohn ... and he is being\nInterviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to bite your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nDeal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's got a drug meal\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the rule was here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God alive Phil Donahue sitters all the time Phil Donahue was hosts do show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look the difference it made for me it if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nMay be something to feel very grateful for I have\nWorkers are trained to look for the Cuban looking
