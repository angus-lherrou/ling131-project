what to do with the month off the mortgage and the Esther refund that can be funneled into something positive for the customer\nEvery dollar matters in my opinion on these situations because we want to reinvent their entire life we want to make sure that they are in the best on now in years to come so you know call this number see exactly how much you can save the average\nMortgage radio listener said five hundred and twenty dollars per month when they picked up the phone and dial this number have earphones ready that six\nThousand three hundred thirty six year and all you have to do is make

people and it turns out five hundred and twenty eight dollars a month six thousand three hundred and thirty six dollars\nA year for ... for folks who called this number but that's the important part that's the part they can't do for you so I'm gonna ask you to take down this number wherever you may be maybe you don't need to do or ... maybe you have a friend and I should also mention that uh they do specialize in the a loans if you know somebody\nWho would qualify and take this number down eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight of course John been talking about\nThe ten year but they do Fifteen twenty and of course Thirty years and that five hundred and twenty eight dollar monthly savings is on folks he went from a thirty or fix to thirty or fix\nCashed to cash out on their primary residence so let's talk about\nA term sell some people um you know they had no interest in shortening the term of their loan it seems too aggressive and some people are really like the thought of saving you know if you do feel from uh thirty two Fifteen year\nYou're saving sixty five percent off the cost of your house and who should be thinking about going into a shorter term\nWell I pay a lot of attention I Know like you're never supposed to discriminate on a lot of different things like in this business trees that you have to be fair to\nEvery different style of life for one thing I pay attention to\nYou know whether it's wrong or right I looked at the age like I really mean it means a lot to me like when do you want to retire like how long do you really believe in your heart that you honestly going to stay in this property those things matter because you want to make it like a made to measure mortgage that's cost them fitted I like my suits made to measure from the ground up a brown every inch of meat to make sure it's it's like\nYou know that they always say like you're swimming and your dad sue 'cause it's all big you know I feel like that's just your general mortgage out there it might help you in some aspects of life but it's not\nThe perfect lawn for you so what I Believe in is making it from the ground up around your income your credit your equity your goals which are looking to do ... how long you want to be in the home thinking big picture like we ask questions like what's up with like your appliances is there any big cash purchases you know you need to eventually make that\nIt'd be smarter to pull the cash now while you're in the lower rate era compared to where the market's moving we even talk about school like how the age of the kids\nThese things matter now when it comes to the shorter term person I was ... when I bought our property there in West Virginia I was like thirty one years old and I was thinking I don't want to be pain on his thing for the rest of my life so my goal is to do a Fifteen year fix and have it paid off and five so you know everyone has a different idea to me I like the raid break there\nA difference between thirty and Fifteen year in those times was over ... percent and a half\nSo to me I'm like wait a second I could easily sling a slightly higher payment compared to what thirty year and I get to trim a hundred and eighty payments I get to see more noticeable results\nI get to increase my credit scores I'm In control and not letting the banks stretches out and milk me for every dime adventurous I like building a security nest egg of equity for a rainy day\nAnd the other day when you get that mortgage bill and you see the principal reduction and it's going to put a smile on your face you feel like your money's going to something of value\nAnd that value as owning more that portion of your home that's called home equity there's a reason they call it the home owner none of your home or so you know start with a call us look at shorter term I Will not tell you guys at every single call go shorter term because\nEveryone's situation is is to have this thing paid off\nSome people need the lowest possible payment\nSome people need to stretch this thing out some people need to get out of jail free card and here's your opportunity this week the special deal is a ten year fix\nMore and more callers are asking about the ten to Fifteen I like to tell you that they start with a tan and usually say yes and the Fifteen or the other side\nThey start with a twenty and say yes to the thirty 'cause they're really similar ten and Fifteen are quite similar twenty and thirty quite similar so let's find out what's the best known for you now in years to come and that starts with

path credit card debt\nI also wanted to mention that network capital as we mentioned earlier thousands and thousands of glowing reviews on line to be precise over four thousand but I should also say that customer service is so important to them\nThey want it to make sure that when this show is on the airline that they have mortgage banker standing by so they are standing by right now it's not\nThat somebody's going to just take down your name and information and make an appointment it's not a receptionist on a plane to take her to a person who answered the phone will be a mortgage

every calls cash out right now Teresa I mean we're in the cash out world the cash out craze I mean this is when most people spend money so they love the idea of paying off dead like credit cards\nCar notes student loans collections\nIt's a good feeling because not only do you get rid of that and get rid of those discussing interest rates but you seem so much money you fix your credit you're in a better credit position so we can have the whole show on just cash out the pay off debts\nAnd people would light up the phones 'cause that's the most rewarding those are the ones I mean the most to me now there's a lot of people calling in and do home improvements like fixing the bathroom\nCurb appeal new roof a lot of appliance work people love term reductions lately cash out around the holidays is usually the most popular cash out the maximum but keeping the monthly payment exactly the same but that's like another one that I think\nThat like let's say you're scrambling for benefit or you know this isn't like the ... the most appealing to you at least call and say like hey how much cash can get if I keep spending the same thing I'm going to do about Joe how much more cash can I have the play around with a lot of people are getting rid of the adjustable rate mortgages and moving to fix their thinking like\nHey I just maximize the positive perks of the arm now I might as well switches security before this adjustable turns and it was a comedy now it's going to be a horror story\nThe other thing is the ... out of malice or call and then a lot you like going to do right there is any kind of switch them we don't really talk about movies menu trees that were doubt on our movies on our show so we'll start bringing that to live too but I'm a lot of people are getting rid of the home equity like a lot of people said hey it's gonna be the year the home equity\nI kinda disagree a lot of people don't like the fact that it's adjustable than most of them are interest only that you have to have a higher credit score the lot of places are only let you do it on your primary residence so there's more options but I don't want to cash out first and then one of the big ones\nFor the month of October the theme has been reduction of ... or eliminating private mortgage insurance with or without the equity position if you got good credit and you got ... we would love to talk to

so let me do a better job on that that means no processing no underwriting no origin ... fees no admission fees\nThe junk lender fees and everyone else was going to squeeze out of you name it completely eliminated regardless of income credit inequity and the call so fast I think you guys are going to love the speed of this company like\nThe main park about them is access\nTo the quick cash

phone lines are blowing up with people that are looking for a result similar to this\nYou know they said eleven hundred and Seventy one dollars a month by going from a forty year to a twenty year trimming a hundred and twelve payments of fat\nThey got an ... month off the mortgage this loan quote clothes and twelve business days\nAnd how we see the big bucks is we got rid of twenty five thousand a credit cards Twenty one thousand left on a car they cashed out fourteen thousand dollars for investments in traveling\nConceived eleven Seventy one four hundred and Ninety four thousand over the life of the loan by dialing one number by just having a benefits consultation with the network Capitol people the number to see results similar to this\nEight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight and their credit was improved on top of all that right yeah one hundred percent so it's the gift that keeps on giving the next time we're going to get a better rate is all from this chest move today\nThis is a mortgage radio show I'm trees a stressor bag with mortgage expert ... met her\nThanks so much to how long have you been calling today that number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight ... and as we've been telling you network capital ran the numbers they wanted to know just how much they were saving you guys are listeners and as it turns out\nThere is a number an average monthly savings\nFive hundred and twenty eight dollars a month they looked at data from I Believe January first to may fifteenth of this year so it's very recent\nAverage savings of five hundred and twenty eight dollars a month but that's for people who picked up the phone and gave network capital call it eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight no\nCapital is a lifestyle brand they don't just care about your interest rate they care about the big picture they want your life to be better\nThey want your holiday to be better if you need cash for that they want your trip to Morocco to be financed they want that college education to be paid for they do not want a walking around with the stress and strain and anxiety of credit card debt and what your credit score\nHigher they just want you to be living in your dream house and if that means a new bathroom a new kitchen I knew pool and new garage door they want that for you they want to take a look at the over all the story of your life your\nCredit card debt your car loan your home loan your specific situation and make it better that's their goal that's their mission that's their dream and that's what they've been doing for many many many years\nIf you give us a call you'll see why they have over four thousand glowing reviews on line the number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight and four thousand reviews aren't enough for you shine always likes to say\nThat that isn't the back of their baseball card so what do people know the stats the numbers who are network capital and how they survived so long in the mortgage game\nWell they've actually expanded well other companies started cutting employees kind of reducing the amount of bankers and one thing about them is the new eventually we weren't going to be in this low rate era so what they did is they were moving lender fees\nThey reduce their margins they drop their interest rates they beefed up staffing they really put a lot of attention into training around their products and process so you know that meant a lot to me that shows that you know they're thinking big picture and not just this month so you know that that meant the world to me if someone that's really versed in this business now\nSome of the things you guys need to know is not only is the company itself incredible but they hired a lot of people that funded so many amounts of loans that they were born in their own individual you know accolades they have a guy named Travis stick\nThe number one v a kid and all of Southern California they have a lot of top one percenters like Angelo Costello Christopher go borrow I'm Ian James Ramsey Todd Travis Dick\nYou know a lot of these people have made the top one percent mortgage professionals in the entire country know another thing that I like about 'em as they were one of the number one ranked lenders on consumer affairs dot com\nThey were at top one hundred mortgage company and mortgage executive magazine one of America's fastest growing company six years running a top thirty financial service company in the nation recently\nNamed as one of the best places to work by the best companies group one of the best mortgage lenders for two thousand and Eighteen per nerd wallet dot com over four thousand five star reviews and they've been in business over Fifteen Years oh another thing that's great is is\nThey're expanding they have an office and Brickell that's in Miami you know it's right when you come over the bridge or a ... right by the capital rural during that amazing office right there\nYou know you guys ... remind me can pull up on your yacht just walk right and I'm also they have an Irvine office of the mortgage capital of the world all the big players in the mortgage game that are right here in Irvine they're also building in an office there you know somewhere in the Beverly Hills area for LA\nNew York's coming soon you know maybe they're even going to dip into the Pittsburgh Charlotte market you know a lot of great ideas coming out of these people they definitely care about credits they care about wiping out all your dad's they want to improve your credit scores they want to do the best job they can on your mortgage\nThe calls so fast like you know and you know all that other stuff was cool but the main thing you guys are going to remember about them is they closed bath they get these things done and as low as ten business days that the fastest that the government will allow them they actually have to run with a parachute because the government set a lot has\nTo take ten business days if there was you know let's see if they could clip them\nLinks to let them fly a little bit they can have these things done same day like it's really that easy like if you fit into their products you know ... they're going to push this thing as quickly as possible same day they might call you back and say hey when can you sign all pushing out\nSeven days and awake and funding as little as ten\nThe no lender iffy special is wonderful people love that but the combination of the low rate the fast turned times the no winner fees that should make you pick up the phone and dial eight hundred\nSeven hundred eight zero six said the call volumes porn and so you know be patient let's get the best bankers on the phone dial this number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nAnd since we're talking about being a lifestyle brand and we're talking about all the people calling trying to get cash out this is always fun what are people dealing with their cash\nI mean they're saving money at the end of the day but people like paying off that anything that's above a foreign percent right now people are dying to get rid of a lot of these loans having introduction period Theresa words low it's kind of a teaser and get you all bought and get your foot in the door and then real soon you find out wait a second this thing's a mother explode and blow up in my face\nYou know it's just like a bad bad grenade and she got they pulled the panda handed it to you know just waiting to blow up and the other thing is people are doing home improvements like eat uh east coast and west coast is so different\nYou know like the east coast guys are all about the elimination of the dead west coast people all about the home improvements and I don't blame him like if I Lived in Seattle San Fran ... town let's say LA San Diego Irvine Huntington Beach these places where the the you know the house or just boom and there's so many people are moving to these areas\nI Would look at a cash out home improvement loan make my house more like you know more appealing to the masses a lot of people are doing cash on vacations we said that was like the number one thing that people take\nYou know they said money for the future is actually vacations and travel people love getting rid of the student loans right now with all that student loan mess that people are dealing with investment opportunities are booming purchasing a vehicle instead of financing it since a lot of these customers are getting better rates on their primary mortgage\nThan they could getting it through the car loan company another a big thing is upgrading household appliances people like money for security nest egg for a rainy day and then at the other day it's about getting rid of delinquent credit obligations collections I don't recommend cashing\nOut if you're only going to pay off collections I like to join a symbol rate reduction used a month off a mortgage and the Oscar refund to pay off those collections\nThat using the leftover money is great for a lot of things like that like the the upgrading appliances the paint off delinquent credit obligations like a collection maybe ... some little silly medical things so there's a lot of ways to maximize your benefits so called network apple today I think you guys going to love what year\nBusiness is booming rates just drop a quarter percent so I ask what are you going to do about it you're going to save money are going to stay on the sidelines and just thinking about doing this and the future when the market is higher you're going to overpay for the same service that you can achieve right now the number eight hundred\nSeven hundred eight zero six said the average\nMortgage radio listening to doubt eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six they'd see five hundred and twenty dollars a month that can be you dial that number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\n... called that number that's right you know how they say fun is my middle name will fun is just a second part of ... first name he's one of over four thousand people to leave a glowing review another shot out for John ... should say this one is on the consumer affairs website by that uh five stars and even writes John ... was very helpful and knowledgeable\nA true professional constantly checking up to ensure that I'm kept updated on my transaction went beyond the call of duty to make it happen I really appreciate everything you did to make my experience\nLess stressful well well ... thank you so much of this very fun and very kind and very thoughtful review I Know how much John chai appreciates it he gets so many shout outs and well deserved I I just want to I Want to stress here I don't know if you get this kind of customer service at a bank\nNetwork capital is not a bank they are direct lenders so how\nElse is your experience going to be different from working with a bang well\nThe thing of a difference between a bank and a direct lender is is the banks definitely going to have higher interest rates are going to have a lot slower turn times because they I mean to give them a little bit of credit they don't have one hundred percent of their chips pushed all in in that direction like\nYou know they're spread thin between investments and you know just store and money and then also mortgages so it's kind of like they're part time mortgage people you know you want to go full time on them but you guys but\nYou know ... you know you pay for what you get so you know if you want to go local if you want to be able to get a coffee handed to you but you're going to pay twenty thirty forty thousand dollars difference I mean we gave me the numbers and\nWe did Cincinnati we did Houston we did San Francisco we told you guys the difference between shop and I believe on direct I don't want to pay lender fees I don't want to take a higher interest rate that I'm going to have for the long haul a lot of these people to lock today they might never refinance again Theresa have rates go where people are saying\nThis might be the last refinanced that they've got to deal with so another thing is is you get to work with the same person from start to finish like I think that's a major thing that we got to do a better job explaining on this show is is\nYou're going to have an explain your same story and your goals to forty different people and it's constantly getting you know last than shuffle I liked it the same person you can call

raising rates to aggressively and essentially stated that that was the reason we saw such a big drop in the markets um\nSo you know he's blaming the fed ultimately for last week's drop in the markets and he's been condemned from uh for that and quite frankly I see both sides to that argument so I understand where he's coming from but obviously I understand the Federal Reserve has a job to do as well so the balance I think well\nThe raising the interest rates is too is is to keep inflation down right that's one ... what other reasons are therefore raising that interest\nLook at the end of the day we have to have interest rates at a at a decent level we use a drop in interest rates as a tool to pull ourselves out of trouble right well the economy appears at least on the stuff is to be taking alone when else do you raise rates now Trump once rates low\nBecause he's really pushing the idea of a healthy economy on his presidency so the last thing he wants to see is a stock market crash before his second term or who then the next election ultimately\nUm but at the same time what the Federal Reserve can do they need tools available to them a typically when we have a major correction the federal dropped rights as much as five percent to try and stimulate\nRates right merit to an ... we don't even have those tools available at some point they have to start raising to give us back the tools we need\nAnd those tools are used to keep the economy\nGoing yeah it's it's what we did in LA right everything's sort of grinds to a whole real estate's crumbling stocks are
