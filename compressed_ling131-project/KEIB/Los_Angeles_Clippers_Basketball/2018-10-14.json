E. I. B. at Los Angeles and he writes\nIn challenging situations I double check to network capital against some of the other very popular companies and they were able to do with the others weren't\nGetting the mortgage was simple and easy the process took under three weeks and they were responsive and courteous it was excellent with the loan officer it was a very pleasant experience and I definitely

customer service is\nParamount there and I think that's something you can feel in Craig's or via which actually led me to a couple of questions so he opens by saying he had some challenging situations and I'm Wondering shine what sort of challenging situations do mortgage bankers face and why is network capital\nBetter able to face those challenges than say a big bank\nI think the main ... with no we're capitalism is the fact that they lend their own money which means there's no interruptions there is no hoops are hurdles new speed bumps slowing you down to get to the finish line of savings\nI like the fact that they can really push the square paying through the circle per se um this customer work with one of the bankers that was a top one percent professional I was mentioning earlier that means a lot to the big you know the customer when they're working with the best\nThe loan officer name was Travis Harley did now one thing is this guy was actually a referral Travis went and bought and\nI Hope I get this right I think it's called a fifth wheel I Know it goes the glamorous and does a lot of like the ... stuff so he when he bought this uh you know off road you know I'm machine\nHe was talking about home loans and different things and that guy actually recommended his friend and this is the review that came from that so it means a lot a lot of customers that listen to our show you know the service might not be for them a lot of people have paid off on the up no dead\nYou know they're living the good life a retirement overly fishing and traveling the world and doing all the

working with network apple they lend her own money you know they don't charge you guys like junk fees the lender fees\nThe headache fees the nickel and dime fees the origin nations these that's the big one like if we could just talk about one lender feed that you want to skip you don't want to pay a rich nation there is no need for your pain and interest rates\nThat should be enough I liked the fact that they can close so quick so we got a lot of people that want this done now like immediately of a like a leave a definite need for this cash in hand as media as possible so if you want to work

anywhere else\nAnd it's why I'm so passionate about people calling this phone number and setting up the appointment eight hundred for nine nine one six five eight because let me tell you when I sat down with Blair I showed him everything I was doing up until the crash\nAnd then the crash happened I lost a ton of money than I\nHe compared to what would have happened had my money in in his strategies right and the difference was\nMind boggling night and day riding night and day and\nThat's why I'm so happy with the show and why I Love when people call in and sit down with you because they really get a great understanding of how to protect themselves how to set this income stream in retirement that they can never outlet\nBill it is so that's when the financial world for just two minutes it is so absurd\nWhen people of course who have never dealt with retirement they don't understand how money works but I asked him and say you know it's funny the car you drove into my office to see me today and the house you left\nAnd your health and even some people would sure their life why wouldn't you have some protection under the most important asset class you have\nIt your retirement for most people it's the largest bucket of money they will ever control yet they come ... violate all the terms over predictable retirement there's no safety there's no predictability let me explain something to you\nWhen you have guaranteed income from a pension of sorts you think you can spend with more confidence do you think you have more discretionary spending you think it's easier to keep up with inflation do you think you have money for medical bills health care how bad you're surviving spouse\nSo here's the simple questions ask your advisor\nWhich you're guaranteed income after this pullback for life\nAnd by the way which the maximum amount of a loss I could basically\nEncounter with my current allocation and you bring me those two questions because I'm here to tell you we didn't lose a penny we could care less what the market does 'cause our income plants are growing designed exactly to produce the income you will need and won three five or ten years\nSo now that pulled back it was whatever it was I don't know how ... what the what the percentage wise actually five percent okay five percent so ... so we can consider if somebody wanted to take out all of their money out of their accounts right as I got scared [laughter] that would be considered a surrender charge ooh oh\nWait a second this is only the Groucho Marx show you know when you said the magic word the duck trumped the al ... so ... your way back to write the wall street doesn't use the term surrender charge do they that's only the evil annuity has a surrender charge but yesterday oh you've been a good student\nIs it not true that had you put your money in the day before or you checked your account balance the day before the pull back\nAnd you want all your money three days later\nCost you five percent they'll send you a check but to surrender charges five percent so far\nAs we've said many times in two thousand eight two thousand nine what was the surrender charge fifty three percent\nSo I caution people to get out of that garbage mindset oh player that I knew what he has a surrender charges five six seven eight percent who cares I Know that's the maximum at somebody violated all the rules of the plan\nRight if you just ... so in other words if you just continue the the plan there is no surrender\n... right because we have a date in the future sent me the Ninety eight percent of the listeners on this show\nMy friends there is no day in the future where your two hundred thousand a year or two million or your ten million dollars is guaranteed to be returned to you you know driving to the show this morning I heard a piece I mentioned the radio station the top financial station\nAnd they were talking about what should investors do\nIs this a good time to you know to buy the dip should they sell should they hold at one of the uh the news anchors said you know with rates up all it'll tell you the truth if I could just get a three percent return in a treasury bond I'd probably do it and I wanted to call him up and say\nWake up\nYou're coming into my world as an example the last month's supply and I've been using extremely successfully was I was calling clients who were equity heaven\nThat at that time may yeah that is a mad\nWhy I'm going to use approximately fifty percent less money to cover the retiree or individuals needed income what do you think I'm going to do with the other fifty percent give it to my tactical managers who managed the risk\nAs well as manage the anticipation of up and down markets this was called for words thinking\nSo when an individual says to me I asked him how much of your income you won guaranteed and they go well Blair I think I Want to sixty eighty or a hundred percent that's how I base how much money goes into the green bucket and how much goes into the red bucket if somebody says where I Want a hundred percent of my income guaranteed no problem\nWe can do that and give you an inflation adjusted income also folks it's all about getting back to the state of mind of people you know\nIn the sixties where the majority of America was actually living on pensions so we have to create these basically synthetic pension type streams of income using the only guaranteed strategy that exists that's called an annuity\n[noise] the number's eight hundred for nine nine one six five eight that's eight hundred foreign nine nine one six five eight give that number a call now\nAnd sit down with Blair and let him show you where your money will be in retirement if you continue down the road that you're on or where it could be in retirement if you use as strategies\nAnd it's ... it's perfect for the person who wants to still stay in the market to some degree but is scared out of their minds illegal and you know I get wanting to stay in the market you just saw twelve great years of the of the Mario would however many years it was\nA ... years I guess out of the market you know of course there's a part of you that doesn't want to miss out on that\nBut that's not what we're talking about we're not talking about\nCutting the legs off any of that with all we're doing is trimming some of the risk adjusted dollars\nHands guess what folks the majority of my heavy equity as best as they go Blair I'll tell you what money I Want you to manage the bond portion of portfolio because the bond portion actually has equal risk as your equity portfolio why because interest rates are on the way up where's the one place you don't want to be right now\nBonds as a former bond trader in the eighties\nThe thirty year declining interest rates is over folks we went from the Eighteen percent treasury down to zero we're on the way up now your bond funds will be devastated\nSandra the regulatory agency actually has a great piece I'll send you a warning individuals' about their quote safe bond funds\nOh this is it as a matter of fact ... says for every one percent rise in interest rates anticipate your bond fund to drop by ten percent\nAnd you know I never think about bond\nOf course people I I just worked on a large large case in individual had two million dollars in to bond funds that if they gave you the name you'd go oh they're really safe until I showed them\nThat in a way to nine those bond funds were down fifty percent so folks the perfect transition is to use the annuity as a surrogate for the bond fund\nNow let me ask you something because I Am I was looking at before the break I was looking at or a him during the ... I was looking at a something that you give to people when they come into your office and it's a it's a ... and you're basically asking questions about their income allocation right\nUm and the first few are really really good questions that\nThat I'm curious about it and it's it it the first one says is my current income strategy strong enough to render a thirty plus year retirement now the reason I liked that one is because I don't think people\nAssume that their retirement or realize that their retirement can be as long as I said ... and and therefore yeah it's difficult to plan especially when you don't have it at anything guarantee numbers say that's an incredible\nRate should individuals or I'll send you this sheet it's an intake steep ask your current adviser Mr Mrs advisor will you write down there my income is guaranteed for thirty year retirement guess what you're not getting a lot of responses on that one\nOr the next one is can identify and solve for potential retirement income gaps in my current strategy so I mean the answer to that has got to be no of course not right\nBecause there's no once again Ninety five percent of the people I sit with their entire plan is jazz built on I Hope so and I think so how do I mean that\nMr Jones what's the guaranteed right of return on your IRA four one K. I don't know I think we're thinking four to six five to seven based on the industry average but it's still a gas\nOr Mr and Mrs visor how much can I spend on my portfolio you're I don't know right now they say about for bank of America Merrill Lynch says two point eight it used to be five once again another guess\nBy the way how long will it my income last I'm not really sure so the three most important questions of your retirement financial dilemma\nR O gases in my world all three of those answers are contractually guaranteed yeah big difference ... it's called the difference between I Know so income and I hope\n[laughter] when [laughter] um the final one is well not the final one but this is the head of the of the other one that really I'm surprised me is what withdrawal rate should I consider for my current retirement assets\nGiven today's economic advisor that thriving and how do they even answer that\nIf I guess because this strategy started out many many years ago\nUh like I say in the eighties it was a five percent rule so if you had sixty percent stocks forty percent bonds right it was called the prudent man's rule we think you should be able to spend about five percent of course remember CDs we're about Fifteen Percent then\nThen after the ... of crash overweight or nine melt down they quickly reduce it to four and like I say Google Merrill Lynch a bank of America they say two point eight five\nIt's a gas feel\nIt's just I guess the individual who have been created that rule says I wouldn't stick to it it's really good [laughter] you can Google it so the point is is that retirement folks\nIt ain't about that balance it's about the cash flow\nYeah and a lot of people are saying this now it's not even when I you know we're not mentally\nOne's true I I'm I'm seeing I'm sort of flattered I'm seeing even some of the larger firms that TV commercials they're talking about we're trying to help you build it in income unfortunately they talk about the variable annuity ... which you know I Am you know is evil in my world yeah right\nLet me give out the phone number and then we have to\nBut a quick break eight hundred for nine nine one six five eight that's eight hundred for nine nine one six five eight give that number to call\nAnd sit down with Blair and ... have your free retirement income analysis because we we really only have an hour of this show\nThat we can talk about this kind of stuff but you get so much more when you're sitting down with Blair he actually breaks down your numbers and shows you the difference between your strategies in his strategies or your your financial planning strategies and his strategies\nAnd you not only that but you walk away with a a really great education on what happens if you knew nothing else you end up with this great education on what's going to happen to your money and I promise you if you don't do anything now once the market crashes you're going to say oh my God\nWhat okay what can I Do object or is there anything I could do to save\nA sale it shows that I asked people look I just have a series of questions to tell me so much about an individual and the first five minutes ago curiosity have you changed anything since oh eight or nine and they say no I go\nThen why are we here and eight hundred for nine nine one six five eight give that number a call and sit down with Blair please now I really believe ... ... after this last week in the market I just think it's it makes so much more sense to do it eight hundred for nine nine one six five at your listener financial bottom line my name's spelled jog around day I'm with is always\nWell plan on strategy is found every time it through design and the four tape formula and best selling author with Steve Forbes Blair errands and we'll see right after the break\nOut even though the used car you're getting a good one you can really trust well start with Katie dot coms most trusted car brand backed by an extensive limited warranty and you've got yourself a certified ... to get going while the getting as good\nFind the one that's right for you at Honda certified ...
