N.M portion to his career my you know some of these guys they coached at it so many different places with so many different legends and you don't know it it's incredible\nYeah how you do after he left a heck of a legacy he did did you all stay in touch\nYeah and I I Know it sounds very well a back in ... Randy so I Know guys very well and when I was the universe stretches the first by scholarship player ever the University of Texas was in my freshman class named Julius Whittier ... and he was a great football player UT and he just he died a couple of weeks ago\n[noise] [noise] I'm trying to remember there was another kind of prominent you stone in that played for Hayden Fry Rufus\nPay for your boss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children\nUnaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that occur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what time for you to walk to the United states and\nI Want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk\nYou know somewhere in the group with you and he gets you across the border is that what you're doing or you just you're in trusting your children to who knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be something\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case the left would make on their behalf would be a these things are so vast so bad in Honduras Guatemala\nI mean they can get a lot worse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so\nMany things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like the same thing we\nTalked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's tap and walk the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block ... there there there's a giant pond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey dad I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like alone [laughter]\nWithout your brother [laughter]\nI [laughter]\nWhat do you stop and think about how\nYou know pretty protective ... yeah exactly I\nI don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] ... outlook there are situations\nYou could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there's a certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this or is there probably are some\nBut it it's just ... you try to it's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of at every one is a four year old who came across the border right in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story\nOr and you just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like this if it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this ... you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like for a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion right\nIt feels like waiting does there just top like they're they're taught the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right like the overriding the security\nThat they're there you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security and you see that Mexico is does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet ah the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful a war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they're going to work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they sent back them they'd send back to them if they do it without permissions they send back to them but we can't we're expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law\nThey've got to streamline law that insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society they are of economic and social benefit to society weight you're you expect your\nGrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation uh they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding writes ah that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport I mean that's a [noise]\nA daily racist right I mean like that is not yet there's not an argument there\nWe would never know you can't do that you can't do that and nor should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans and ... percent we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I ... I Would you I wouldn't ... I Can't I Can't think of one Trump supporter\nWho would have a ... a supportive policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages\nOf white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive\nWho are here because they want to be here and be part of the society or going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it's ... ... security for me but not for me\nAnd that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible it is a line\nThere that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's politically wanted to split the bottom line is we are we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up that is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting as a gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that yeah saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard any of them doing that\nAre any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general\nTheme for the party I did hear at all talking about it in the debate or I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona\nA race or where I'm\nAt Sally had I think a great chance of winning or people because her opponent there is like if you took Michael Moore\nAnd put him in his brain into a female body of a congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh yeah hang if the ... of democracy she saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows\nI mean she is as it's incredible but they've decided to run her\nAnd just and thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots in history and the air the air force are incredibly accomplished yeah that's a great chance of winning in in a tough environment or in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know your he makes gives a coat pink worker a code of pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona\nAnd it was a huge mistake I think\nFor her to be their number literally with code picker night ... um that started rising reviews I don't know exactly she yeah she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands\nI'm born and raised in the fourth generation in El Paso I'm In a community that has more than ... percent Mexican American\nA ... first of all I was just you know I'm not Hispanic I had no one calls me\nOr any name other than stew of at this point which isn't even my named either or you can criticize me the same way you can talk about better because that's actually not my ... my name's Steve\nI'm ...

what happens in these border towns can't avoid it it gives you can't avoid it not just him trying to his pander to Hispanics in ah Texas that's not what it's about he just happened to have a life long nickname because everybody knows\nEverybody does every white person does now that doesn't always happen when you go on television and people are going to call you Bob and then this is going to be part of your ... their fault but that's because he was probably a white guy that didn't understand the Hispanic culture of Robert Francis overall yeah about ... he made a mistake when he says is\nSure yet [laughter] and then the fabulous guitar playing I mean the guy was incredibly talented I don't know how he didn't take off as a rock star out of that\nI just don't understand it but again I don't

they do yeah I I don't know I [laughter]\nI'm not sure exactly I all I Know is anyone with those letters you get to bed or somehow yes and I'm sure I mean this goes back ... back to kids play pranks on each other like if I if I Do a prank call you or no or you know phone's ringing you answer it mhm\nHello uh Hi do you have prince better when Ken this is so common that goes back so long mhm it's so deeply ingrained deep in in our in our community\nYeah her hers for our Beto everyone knows that I remember that everyone's water lever for my child\nYeah mhm [laughter] everyone watched and [laughter] and I'm Glad that you were able to to\nTo see a ... this is all coming together for ... he's able to again teach us I I'm trying to find out the truth\nAnd we're now learning from many people across the country what the truth is which is so far nothing that Beto said has been accurate but I think we're going to find out the opposite very soon\n[laughter] well we've asked for people to call us and tell us about there are white friends named Beto in El Paso or my calendar whatever border town you live in because I'm sure it's common not just in those two towns but virtually every\nBorder town I Would assume that you know were white people are called Beto everyone knows that uh yeah I'm so let's talk to\nLive in a in Texas have ... you're on the Glenn Beck program with that just to\nGet the money guys you want to keep me up over here in El Paso\nIt's good to hear\nSo yeah you have a lot better off the air and I'm like okay\nI actually do I have three and my husband is that show my stepson is that you know and my father in law is also bad so that none of them go by Robert none of them\nNone of them so they all go wait\nThey all really do go by Beto\nNo there really are and that's how I told him this you're going to need that I mean up here pretty soon buddy and he says no way that the the three of\nThem actually don't like the name Robert so they go by their middle names anyway so there's no better than my family\nOf three Roberts in your family your friends have so and none of them go by betcha none of them do what um what is your what is your background are you a boring white person\nI Am I'm born and raised and I get the question all the time are you military and they say no there are white people here in El Paso\n[laughter] medicine allow did they do allow that okay good ah that's interesting I I uh\nI ... and that seems to be evidence against ... it does we really should report this to him when he goes on national TV and says these things you know the fact checked hard today to get a ... day for 'em\nYeah thankful that my gosh oh wow very upset about this so that's well only every person who was cold so far has contradicted a Beto yeah on\nThat and that's why like I you know we want to be factual we want to deep deep deep into the science and that's what we're doing here you know a pat and I both come from a

he's climbing key to write right this second yeah right I think they're getting their like their\nTwo thirds of the way to the summit second tie a highest peak in the world some people say if the highest in the most difficult to climb and we probably should have spent more time on this I Know Glen Glen does not want to bring it up because you know he you know it feels like it's bragging or whatever but yeah Cape ... to this weekend you can follow his progress I I I Know there's a website I don't remember what the name of it is but if you kind of go out to search for\nA Glenn Beck climbing K. two it'll probably pop up\n... because I think they're doing this on the dark Web yeah a lot of thought last time he just you know some reason he puts up on the dark Web uh so I don't I don't know maybe you'll have to find that there\nAre but we're we're uh we're here talking about a Beto O'Rourke a Ted Cruz in the Texas Senate battle a lot of people calling in and saying that they\nKnew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and then there's ...\nIt says it could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are uh you know from the\nDifferent cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of look into as a possible cause for better or confusion here um\nThere are issues however when you try to appropriate culture\nOr when you try to reach into some other uh cultural group and and and speak to them sometimes there are issues there's a case it is that the media is like ... is is like liking to highlight today\nA and it's just it's a commercial run on behalf of congressmen in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all\nAlthough surely if you watch CNN Today he will be\nYou know ... hours uh it's just some unrelated group running an ad in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance law situation um where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum\nWhich is completely unconstitutional to have in this country\nUh when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on the behalf\nOf the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is a bad being run in Arkansas\nIt's a it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your call and whether you can detect anything seems a little odd to here here's the ad from a the group supporting French all\nWhat do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may French and the Republican no dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me if the Democrats can do that to a white justice at the Supreme Court with no\nEvidence no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend\n... founders when white girl\nLives on them\nWant me to let him black poker game turnout always told my son don't be around with\nIf you get

rain the verdict life ... ...\nWhat are white girls going is right\nPaid for by black Americans from the president's out into not authorized by any candidate for candidates committee\nOf all I Would normally watch his show with ... and you know this sounds fantastic and these are obviously really going on there making yeah right like the point of\nAnd this is a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that you know we we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just the Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot at the streets for no reason because for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man overeat and we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race of mail but this is the type of thing that makes no sense\nI mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about ... about the Emmett Till\nI mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they didn't and entire communities went and attacked the black person\nYou've been there at the point the only real repercussions this guy has as face for any of this anti Semitism\nIs you know basically that he occasionally get say public denial from a public source and remember he he was a he said that very early on with Obama\nSaying that he he said he would say this yeah he's got to distance himself from it but that's okay as long as he does the right thing right you know I mean that's\nA it's a it's it's a terrifying thing and the idea that I mean certainly\nThe the you know you remember the million Man March right which was not millions but it was a lot of people are you the nation of Islam is not a a group of of twenty here yet will find the Jews will not replace\nThose guys from Charlottesville gosh that's a national story and we talked with a ... years and years and years and years the biggest

I'm Dave Anthony Fox News that the secretary of state Pompeo said arriving in Mexico city for talks about the caravan of thousands of Central American migrants headed to the U.S border\nYou got to see a pattern and have their little been Republican slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and fifty six was outlier most of the time is right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house wow again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent and outs two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race with these ah with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean that was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz is influenced by your heart rate made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world um but I mean\nHe he's raised this doesn't even clue Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was compared to ... racing and what's your what he wants more\nIn the in the uh if you compare quarter last quarter of the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCandidate that's a presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh\nNow it's funny to the Senate race record he broke\nWas the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running children Tiller he did not win that race was not a close race\nEven though Rick lasagna wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race it was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win but I mean again ear between Iran and fifty in almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five\nThat's a big she is um and the other thing that's kind of interest\nAnd on the in the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days and now and now we just you know we have a\nGoing back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent\nEight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean\nSixteen percent it's still not high but it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency race is a little bit more often if you're worried about the Senate\nThere's a little bit of there's a little bit of something there should be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're gonna see a fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of seats oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas are those who were in question ... I I think\nTed winds up winning by maybe ten points or more I think it'll be a double digit\nI think there's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah I think that's where he stands right now yeah or Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida in ... Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top ... yeah well I saw it's close but don't they pretty much a toss up race but\nThose other I mean Florida is a complete ... reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how they do a rifle junior I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that as your brand they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nI don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski Joe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them\nAll of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest concern of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I'm a craft or now communist again the socialist in communist yeah\nI mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting flooded so so much by the White House and by the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that's the seat and Mick Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nBut you know again ... West Virginia is a state it's probably the most pro Trump to state in the union\nHe won West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I mentioned got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know ... you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capable almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota\nBut I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mentioned you've got his cabinet vote you have a couple of it but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a he's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls\nIs an interesting development there\nAre but I did a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment or right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortably but even without the mansion seat your ear at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one\nIt would be a real surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there's a good you know eighty percent chance that they're the most models that are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's a I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota or she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin Greenberg so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my pursuit there I think honestly you had two races decided\nBy the cabinet vote one was a mansion job like high camp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race so\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it and then she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said a double digits situation happens\nThere yeah look again North Dakota's a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and you know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is one we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator\nAnd there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances would the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from\nCory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far left figures and good for North Dakota and for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks that way yeah yeah there's some uh optimistic things there it could but the dangers there as well\nI mean this is going to be an interesting one and ... and not the thing that's really unfortunate is if if that happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now\nWhich is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly you lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and\nI think there's gonna be almost nothing they can get through almost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which still find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it but other than that you're gonna get any real advantage not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to have tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy\nAs long as you keep running a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah and she asked just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah yeah it's not a problem to show you the house and how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're going to say well oppose got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know what let's hope we're not sure but right now the models are showing\n'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats now it's a point one percent chance to really unlikely like you say that that an absolute no what's that going to get to eighty three right ...\nPreparedness needs and from their line of emergency food storage that last up to twenty five years revolutionary electric pure water filtration systems\nOr dozens of other products their preparedness specialist can help you make the right choice for your family\nCall a hundred two hundred and Seventy one sixty three get started now or go to prepare would lend dot com for their latest special offer eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three or prepare with Glenn dot com my patriots apply\nIf you're concerned about your heart health or know someone who it then you can consider cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone and it fits in your pocket you can take an EKG anytime anywhere to order and basic cardio dot com\nThat'd be a A R D I ate dot com and give you feel heart racing or either sent them to\nTake any Katie on your phone and it just ... you can have peace of mind to knowing your heart rate them is normal cardio is also prevented attacks atrium relation comment heart condition and leading cause and here I'm going to order cardio mobile today busy cardiac dot com K.
