I mean because I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight and I'm trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't\nBe remembered him they tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington D. C. would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nBy the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like charging cities and\nThey're taking over it that's the I shouldn't say that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we\nKnow what we're talking about mob\nMob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that their that's their usage so is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are trying to what it was a ... truck in tents on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh's a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not to I was in trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess the other end that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nJust as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... ... is an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media does not\nSee harassing conservatives that's causing trouble correct\nThat is the issue correct they see this as a correctly that that like the you know there it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the\nPeople you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean they guy and the Irish guy over our [laughter] let me tell you leave the white people they those white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay\nSo let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob yes I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtesters guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy\nFor what a mob a protest that looks like he is a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech he's a white lie around things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he said knock the crap out of them are what you and say OK tests knock the hell I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push protesters guarantee to sorry sorry [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo they go and where we see this now here's\nHere's the problem let's ratchet things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says\n... I think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker sake get up in their face he he might think that that's okay but\nThe stories has looked at the Nineteen thirties and forties\nThe U.S is in the midst of a tepid economic recovery falling a catastrophic downturn but millions of Americans continue to feel left behind some turn their anger on corporations in Wall Street others target non white immigrant workers\nA charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities conservatives denounced the president and his allies for flouting the constitution and steering the United states toward socialism meanwhile many on the left warned that fascism is taking root in America\nOkay let's just go through they'll just go through this because they say this isn't this isn't our time\nThis is this is\nThe Nineteen thirties and forties\nOkay uh the the US isn't a massive topic each tepid economic recovery following a catastrophic downturn millions\nOf Americans continue to feel left behind yep that's that's been proven now we're not in a tepid recovery are we some turn their anger on corporations and Wall Street yes that would be the left\nThat would be the left and others target non white immigrant workers\nWho's doing that\nI mean I guess they would claim that's like border enforcement right like\nYeah that's border enforcement that'll offered than ... yeah the ... the law they're claiming we do not know who's in our country and we're also worried about terrorism I'm a charismatic media personality with a populist message attacks religious minorities well who could that be [laughter]\nI I don't know I Know I went to stand with Israel if anybody's attacking religious minorities hell with that religious majorities it's the left\nConservatives denounces the president and his allies for flouting the Constitution's during the United states toward\nSocialism yep did that one because\nThat's what's happening that's what did happen I ask a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez yeah that's a it's a crazy accusations rice point\nMany on the left warn that fascism is taking root and America no socialism is taking root in America socialism\nYeah I mean people in the less they fascists every time someone do something they don't like right as the ... fascism if that is it socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline\nWhere all socialist now\nThat's what sleeping is sweeping the nation are parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties I thought oh that\nIs an understatement of the year can use a lot of the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect but that is one way to describe yeah you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate but as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today political rank or social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies\nSparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of today or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism\nOr the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more hang on\nKevin ...

[noise]\nAnd the Glenn ... pub and you know if you look at the the civil unrest in America and you really look at the history you will find that it is\nAlmost always the left and in particular the communist or Marxist left\nThat is behind the civil unrest if you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and still gets that's\nYou know a a paragraph each but after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting riots usually called strikes now some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these come from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the plan\nHe shows the first to a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\nThe Klan goes real resurgence\nAnd he was heavily involved in it ... to the military and all sorts of things\nSo you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again in the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen onward will that's because of the segregation and all of the things that are progressive\nPlanted alright but let me just go through and see if you can find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike May Day riots read this summer the Boston\nPolice strike the steel strike any of those\nSeems a labor related I Would say it's labor related doesn't it and labor who I'm Sorry\nIf you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world who are the international workers' of the world\nOf of course based in communist and Mars is it is the communist\nArmy here in America the international workers' of the world unite rise up against your oppressors\nYou also had in Nineteen sixteen the preparedness day bombing in San Francisco a you had a um [noise] uh you had read summer which was about twenty of them you hadn't made a riots\nYou had the scent trail you a massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing that was the last in communist saying you you can't get involved in the war because it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop the best way to say\nThat were icicles with a bomb right the scent trail you a massacre if I'm not mistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization that was against a all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming home so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up\nRioting and killing people\nOkay good then you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nIt's a ... century earlier was a an industrial workers of the\nWorld by ... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike do you even know what that one was that when that happened that may ninth\nThrough October twelfth that one's shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle of the overpass the republic steals strike almost all of these\nAnd including many of the race riots have communist and Marxist fingerprints on them\n\nI said it's it's a fundamental to the ideology right rebel yesterday is fundamental to the ideology source and not surprising that this was happening again\nSo I just I'm I'm really tired of of sharing a\nOr I should say it this way I'm really tired of the media and there lies\nYahoo are allowed to defend yourself today if you are under threat\nAnd you feel that your family and you are in a actual unsafe condition not\nIn college I feel unsafe but in actual ... excuse me\n... let me talk up what may talk stood up and took a protester\nDoubt what game Ben\nAllowed to have done that I don't mean down like ...

I mean these are all the ... or I'm all out those and then you know we made a papier-mache volcano and it's a\nPretty old prince pretty elaborate a but then I I have to post that and I have to post what my sister said to me last night my sister Michelle who is probably the most talented in the family\nShe sent me oh we're working on her gingerbread ... you know house for contest or you know again this year and they always you know when a ribbon and whatever [laughter] and she's like a massive over ... so she said oh this year we're doing a wizard of Oz theme\nLincoln oh okay [noise]\nThe wizard of Oz is she just showed me she just finished the witches house\nAnd she showed me and see it goes up here and she's making a gingerbread tornado and the house is sitting in the tornado it's\nCrazy it's like raising ... even begin to think about what that would look like a show it to yeah to me I have to posted I'll posted next to my volcano and you tell me which one sicker\nOkay I mean I admit my family is riddled with illness mental illness can't stop can't stop a but I'm healthy compared to her\nAnd I got this ... this leads me to a bizarre question I Can't believe I'm asking an already but it's big gingerbread making a move here for an additional holiday have you noticed is\nLately I've noticed some Halloween gingerbread houses\nNow gingerbread houses are Chris ... right after Christmas maybe Thanksgiving a high on them because we aren't yeah right yeah yeah yeah we have to\nHalloween gingerbread houses at our house I won't do it I thought I won't do it what are the things you're trying to do yeah we're going to have this like July Fourth jammed her bread houses it they're red white and blue that damn\nRussian Austrians or whoever's behind that and you know that's a foreign influence definitely Russian OSCE here because there's so many Russian Austria\nI Want to thank and a stance or he is he's a guy that we had books last hour and I\nKind of went in a different direction but I it it fits right in to what we had been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back\nAnd we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth\nDo not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are\nTrue to be civil and kind to one another but\nWe were not in a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage of a nice time to talk about it outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime at your age and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've gotta walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is dance response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but it but I but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were\nThey wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts open\nWe're going to go really a wry reality like ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation has face their challenges\nBut this is our moment and it ends in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats we have some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society were once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated a outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build\nIs with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians at this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYour fight but you fight a you know for example uh you can't war at a people and reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now\nAnd I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nBut not participate in creating photo and falls crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react or out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attractive to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S\nThat draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a there's a difference between the two and you know I'm so for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just telling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling\nThat's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproaching an income for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling lure we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back in just a second first let me tell you about gold lying a President Trump\nHas been a warning about the risks to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress this November we will see an impeachment proceeding that does not mean that they will remove him from office but they will impeach him", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "10"}
