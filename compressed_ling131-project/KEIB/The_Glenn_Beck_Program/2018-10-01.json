department and to avoid losing whatever political capital I may still have\nOminously analogies with scientific racism were made by some I'm afraid we're likely to hear more of it in the future\nSo what was the topic of this so wildly controversial paper\nIt was a statistical study of the achievement gap between men and women at similar levels of intelligence and it's not all good news for me in the study found that there are more men than women at the extreme ends of the intelligence scale\nIn short men tend to be really really smart\nOr really really dumb that's not a new hypothesis\nCharles Darwin first study that he called it the great male variability hypothesis wild there are more men than women that win the Nobel Peace prize they're also more men living on the

had signed a copyright agreement with the New York journal mathematics so they can't publish it anywhere else now either\nSo this is sort of like what\nThe national Enquirer did for among others are president which is where you go and buy the rights to a story and then you don't publish them because it's part of buying the rights to that story\nYou prevent that story from being published by anyone else same debaters and our research directors been reading a book called the coddling of the American mind\nThe authors operate on the hypothesis that there are three great untruths being fostered in American education today the book is called the coddling of the American mind\nThe first is the great untruth that we are fragile beings and we need to be protected from all harm including ideas that don't mesh with our wishful thinking\nThe second great untruth is that we should always trust our feelings and our emotional judgments are better than logical assessments\nFinally the third is that we were in constant battle with evil people that is called the of the ring of those who disagree with you\nThis constant battle with evil people that's what the left under takes it's this idea that conservatives and Republicans\nAre not just people with whom you disagree\nYou observe them you you make them different they're Nazis they're monsters they're fascists will maybe they just

of your enemies you don't you don't disagree with them you don't you don't engage them on the basis of ideas because ideas have proponents and opponents ideas have arguments to be made in their favor

here in St ground\n[noise]\nI um [noise] I got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing sheet remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was the woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by ... head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nLet me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack and\nAlso not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in ... her expertise is on old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before\nI continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any of CNN sock it to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is\nAbsolutely devastating to you I Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she adds I Do not think that er\nReasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee I don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for prosecution [laughter] but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Iraq Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor addicts crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility as in with a left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour\nBecause every one who saw this knew exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute\nIt may look like she's credible ah but based on what she said not how she looked\nIf you are looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lifts the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein office the date of attacked change to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well\nIf you say you're in your late teens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen you're in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years\nIt it gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged hack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties\nPerhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false\nAnd\nIt was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post for narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most traumatic andme important Nick ... events of her life\nAnd [noise]\n\nBut we will come back ... from the south of ... own ...\nWill come back or this was amazing to watch kind of from a different perspective yeah first of all people over there don't care they're just going about their lives which is kind of how I Want to be I Want my life to become a but it was interesting watching it in that\nI've never seen anything like that you know the people who are speaking with certainty about the ... it's incredible yes she has provided\nNo evidence whatsoever that this event has occurred the standard instead of being innocent until proven guilty or innocent or the preponderance of evidence to prove shows otherwise\nHe's has become innocent until proven accused\n... we now know that she's accused this but Kavanaugh so therefore he's guilty but not a healthy standard for society and how any woman I'm a or leftist who has a son\nCould possibly support this standard because this is not just evil Republican judges that have to deal with this for the rest of their lives is your kid your kid if they go to a party in college\n[noise] thirty forty years later when they're advancing through their career can be accused of this with absolutely no evidence\nAnd society is deciding yes we should just believe her there's not even there's not even a five percent chance that she's shown like we're at the point now where what we're requiring in this FBI investigation whatever it is is Kenny come up with a five percent into that you think maybe it occurred and el ...\nYou may not even one that your parents your parents and your siblings won't stand behind yeah\nHer parents her mom or dad and her siblings will not stand by her statement\nShe could've named anyone she's named people and they don't remember the party they don't remember being there this is beyond a reasonable doubt that the shit out about this a lot over the weekend and I think I Know what's happening\nAnd it's dangerous at all like ...\nI Love the fact that we have we can now say American Made American Jobs American manufacturing\nAmerican products made

city near you you can find them\nOn line at Glenn Beck dot com slash tour went back to com slash tour I'm All right we're talking about the capital thing and I I\nI Want to talk to those people who I think are reasonable\nWho can look at Ford and see her testimony and say okay so why why why wouldn't we just do the FBI thing in a reasonable world you're you're absolutely right in a reasonable world you're right but this is not about Ford\nAnd this is not about making sure\nThat these charges stick its why as soon as this happened\nAs soon as Jeff Flake said no no wait a minute hang on we want an FBI or investigation as soon as that happened the narrative changed now they're going after him saying he lied about drinking beer\n[laughter] okay he was for the love of Pete people so this is how do you look\nAt how in the back of the issues that he wasn't buyout drug\n... how would you couldn't for him he was I Know I Know\nIt's ridiculous I Know so uh\nWe're getting to that later because I as an alcoholic I got a lot to say on that one [laughter] um but ah\nThey've changed the narrative and they are playing the American people and here's an here's how it's working\nWhat they've done is they've turn this into something that is more than Kavanaugh look if Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us do nobody does that's a bad thing\nBut you can't just smear somebody you have to have some evidence so because of the lack of evidence what they've done is they've not made this about Kavanaugh they've instead made this about\nVictims evidence play the elevator encounter with Jeff Flake\nOut my national and all\nThat going to be here and now that you might you know who they don't want my heart is not alone\nIn your carry on\nThis woman has obviously a horrible experience in her life\nSo when she hears an accuser she immediately believes the accuser well that's not reasonable she's obviously very very upset because of what happened to her and she wants to send a message that that's not right I agree with that\nBut that's not the standard of justice or the way we get justice let me take you to a real life scenario I didn't understand America when OJ was let go I didn't understand it I I Know what is happening how can the African American community be cheering this guy\nWell it's very easy once you're away from it emotionally and you actually look into it it's easy\nWhat was happening was African Americans were feeling that there was no justice in America it's always the black guy that gets blamed and then he goes to court and the white system puts them behind bars and so they weren't rooting for him\nThey wanted anyone to beat the system they wanted anyone to prove that a black guy couldn't ... could go to court and not to be guilty that's what they wanted they wanted a victory against the system\nTotally understandable\nUs the African American community now same people did O. J. Simpson do it yes\nWe're all in agreement now now the the emotions are gone we're all in agreement that OJ Simpson was guilty\nIf Kavanaugh goes down in flames Monday morning or Saturday the president should announce his next Supreme Court justice\nPick of Mike Lee and you should vote on it next week because there's no need to delay he's already had all those FBI background checks and each senator knows exactly who he is he's qualified jeeze clean\nAnd quick you could get that done long before the election if I hear the ... the Republicans if this fall through the whole we're prepared we weren't prepared for that\nI'm going to lose my mind [noise]\nSo that I Will bring up the story about what their plan is after oh geez what is their plan after a they have a quote NO PLAN both [laughter]\nSo that should go bad completely that we need to go through that say because\nYou're right that's my only when my ... they they know what are they going to say they know him do we have more time to get to you know him yet you work with them every single day he'd be great it'd be great\nAll right my patriots supply from hurricanes earthquakes cyberwarfare every American should have a plan to get through an emergency a natural disaster just a power being out\nThis is more urgent than ever we've seen government response repair to infrastructure can be a little slow now people want to say that it was racist about a a Puerto Rico I Will tell you the overwhelming factor on why Puerto Rico was left in the condition it was\nIt was because FEMA had no money left there was no plans in the history of the United states to handle for major disasters in a year and the ... the year that that happened there were four major did that disasters FEMA came out at the end of the year and said\nYou're on your own if another disaster happens in Eighteen because we don't have the money to do it they're still getting back on their feet\nMy patriots supply is the place you go to help your self help your family\nMake today the day you prepare\nEveryone in your household you to have a four week emergency food kid there was a special right now going on for this week a hundred dollars savings when you go to prepare with Glenn dot com for week food kits ship fresh discreetly to your door do it now order and save one hundred dollars per kid on the best seller this week\nIt's eight hundred two hundred and Seventy one sixty three eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three or online at prepare with Glenn dot com [noise]\nYou know that feeling when you just know you're experiencing a whole new level of excellence I have felt it a few times a first luxury car even my first iPhone you're experiencing a game changer that is exactly the way I felt and you will feel the\nFirst time you sit in an ex chair I knew immediately the generic chair the suck and we spend so much time in those stupid chairs get a great chair\nAnd ex chair most of us spend more time in our office chair then in bed that's why the ex Jerry's so important ex chair now on sale for a hundred dollars off go do X chair back dot com right now that's the letter acts chair back dot com or call one eight for for\nFor X chair ex chair comes with a thirty day no questions asked guarantee just go to ... dot com use the ... and get a free foot rest as well just for using the ... code back eight for for for ... or ... chair back dot com\nBoom and his number one in the U.S making Bonnie Tyler the first Welsh singer to topped the charts and this week\nIn Nineteen Ninety five one story morning glories released and make more and more stores or the British rock band only make champagne supernova exclusively releases a single mom un reaches number one on the modern wrong [noise]\n\nPlug it back to the program [noise]\n\nWelcome back to the program a story of Larry sharp on a about a half hour from now\nRecall interesting uh he's running for governor in New York and libertarian libertarian any things got to be better than\n...

changed actually take eat these political quizzes every now and then and my ideology has stayed the same what was happening though is that the the party itself has gone absolutely and think oh this is not this is not what I signed up for\nRight um I've been watching you on Twitter and you've been um\nYou know one of the only Democrats that have come out and said this is nuts gimme gimme are viewing the lay of the land from a democratic point of view from your point of view\nSure I think it's perfectly legitimate to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's nomination on the basis of differences and judicial philosophy you know if you believe certain things that he doesn't align with those beliefs let's find out what the democratic process as for\n'em now that being said you you leave it at that right you don't go ahead and try to chop off someone's head and promote these outrageous accusations against them specifically the the one by this this woman Julie sweat Nick\nWho just don't even know that I mean we're there they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I can kind of speak to the culture and how\nHow does a community to operate I mean the thought that a group of Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape cartel all throughout high school and that nobody would know anything about it up until now is just ludicrous and then that ate\nAt a goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened achievers frequenting parties with high school ...\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man oh\nAll me and my buddies we were the college checks were all over [laughter] you know women women usually look for a young man you know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who let's be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete torque when he was the ... when he was in high school this is somebody who can ... you can see on his talent or he literally has notes on his parents would ...\nI mean this guy was a complete ... in high school and he's like the kind of guy if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this was great I'm really happy so the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel\nIn the suburbs of Maryland it's just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we've abandoned a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on\nA matter of faith based on historical pattern of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late but they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things\nBecause you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism and there it still exists therefore he's guilty right it's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRace so you know it was John Carlos I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago that the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the un Nicole and they all know it yet so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared to\nIn them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and it let me tell you I think a doctor's poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness says as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt or testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nOr just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so\nThe fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what they're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank when he was in in college or whatever I mean who cares\nBut it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like waiting at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving [laughter]\nSo Shankar what we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat or who uh has not lost his footing a with with reason um\nSo the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also a a a chance at USCB Cooper ready to be ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the commit this right\nAnd there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented the scope of tore right that the guys calendar clear is that right\nIt's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also query him so you you have to cast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic\nWhere we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way there's is into court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because what you have here is a series of accusations that have been made with zero Robert of evidence zero independent\nEvidence to back us up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nChurch testable she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happens four times\nSo I think people need to cast aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of the country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now and based off his own memoirs of somebody who is a very quotable person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not bred cabinet but he we were not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with his judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut well we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically\nThat's insane that's what they do in in in ...

has words that's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York what do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote because a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority of ... we don't require fifty one percent there's often go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen ... percent ... percent of the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be forward when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nTo does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know there's nothing to do awfully yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York uh would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even come in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats and Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government they will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant it's just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that will libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened in civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government now they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\nThere will be a massive a massive culture shock within within the uh the state of the nation but something else\nI don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete rebuild of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nI next that the credit culture of transparency is a problem with low governments now is they're enforcing the kings well so they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights\nOf the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what does that I don't know I Know I Know it's I'm not sure where he's an old ducked down due to document\nTheir ego yes they are I think we sort of the way a while ago\nBut yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families who met or individual businesses that individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community\nWe don't do that well in New York said it all we have things called regional economic economic development of corporations\nWhich Albany which is our capital and decides where the money is spent\nAnd opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow 'bout instead the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and sort of lowering spending\nHere's one idea that does both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial bridges named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that British named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass it up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year a marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that's using the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area and hundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nThan a law that taxes hang on just like a Texas New York's popular says Texas you listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but he has the best part now we have them do maintenance again and we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just to repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now and you know if they collapse we don't have enough money these guys do will have to have safer bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars you know if you're a truck driver I don't think a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge\nLess money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so there you are you ... it's amazing to me how we\nAre running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the common sense\nDemocrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is I mean this was selling Texas how do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already seller\nBefore the Republicans and they all kept given up I mean they don't show up all the Democrats I think I'm afraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who do vote vote because of fear we can't have fear but the reason why people vote it's simply the wrong answer [noise] man\nBut I Would say that in reality I'm trying to change just to make it so that people stop voting for the last of two evils and instead vote for someone and it is working I Am actually using if you notice\nI'm using non traditional media tradition to me it does not want to cover me and polls don't want to deal with me but not immediate is working and I'm getting out there and people are seeing me they're responding to me and this is what's working the way to make this happen is through non traditional media and believe it or not\nPeople are getting it they actually like it I hear all the time people say Larry I don't agree with everything you're saying but you actually answer questions you actually have a plan\nAnd they love it and that's what I say and look my plan may be faulty maybe they won't we can't leave all the bridges maybe we can't raise fifty billion maybe the only race thirty billion\nThat when you know I Know happy with that ... ... and let me ask you can I hold you over for one more break yes okay ah hold you over and and tell me how we fix education and higher education\nIt's out of control its its post modernist it's indoctrinated and it's in leaving our children to debt
