I don't wanna\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of a\nHighly should to use a word that's a pretty harsh word but it's true\nTell everybody what's at stake here you know that there wasn't a lot\nTo say there's a lot at stake and [noise]\nMaybe especially so because this man was a reporter to something you'll be surprised me say that if something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nThe media would love an announcement that the United states will not do business with Saudi Arabia premature though it would be when that is a major major economic partner\nThe media loves this sort of dramatic action\nSort of like you're at a charity auction they just want somebody to stand\nUp and say Hi dollars sure you you make twenty eight thousand dollars a year and they need to do something dramatic\nEven know what you what you just one into bed\nNo but I wanted to do something dramatic\nWell\nHow 'bout we'd be a bit more reason and you go to the silent auction and put it in a bed for a hundred dollars on something you can afford and I'm not be irrational because America's commercial interests should not be so easily compromised\nBecause a reporter wanted to make a story out of a question America's interest commercial interests and national security interests should not be so easily compromised by individuals who do not understand the ... ... ...\nAllergy the comprehensive nature and the complicated nature of our international relations [noise] the same reporters demanding that Trump shutdown trade with Saudi Arabia that we not attend Saudi business summit's\nThose same reporters had no problems with the Clinton family foundation\nReceiving loads of money from absolute death spots\nFrom individuals who were torturing citizens in their own country who were suppressing any dissent who were accused of human rights violations broad human rights violations\nThe Clintons were giving speeches are receiving money bill Clinton was giving speeches and receiving money\nFrom countries that secretary that ... that the department of state led by his wife did not even recognize that we're on watch lists that were on the ... list\nAnd it almost makes you wonder maybe those despot gave money to Hillary Clinton's husband so they could get off that list maybe they gave money to Hillary Clinton's husband so they could still do business in this country\nEven though our diplomatic approach was to put them in the corner in time out for now gosh where have we seen Democrat couples\nWhere money is given by an entity to one of the spouses and the Democrats couple to gain the influence or to gain influence\nAnd as the kids as the kids say nowadays [noise]\nGang October ...\nGland that program and we need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to now ... we need to make that a oatmeal soup that she made in ... found don't know I think we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because\nThis is this is just outrageous don't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and\nShow everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO she was she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware\nYes ah which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won the ... the media revised that can they actually looked at the report says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve ... then they realized loops deep sea we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't do see in the corruption but they pay they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one uh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course he didn't have itself so he kept the\nHuman body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces\nThat one of them one of those\nPieces would have a little bit of Cherokee now this theoretically right I could at least give her a\nTechnical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid soup recipes and pow al ... which is the goal of almost everybody\nPower in America how how some wild child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's where I'm going all ... I'm going all full\nI I've just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of softball teams but what's ... I don't want to hear how wild out already or from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since it's a tribe to trial it does the\nI mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing in her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and and it doesn't exactly\nShow what they try to make it out to ... show any DNA from an actual Native American yeah what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA study so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against we have to use\nPeople from ... New Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want it migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood but it's not even what they tested\nA and even that is it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed in like to point out over the years he would not\nShow the hit Canadian blood right like that's not the way this works they all well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian DNA does is it shows the lineage of game shows it's it can be interesting in some way show migration patterns and I wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic than a prominent French disorder or it's true it probably would show about\nA foot so it's interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all is it does not even show the Native American thing\nSecond of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her great great great great grandmother I think\nA several generations back\nAnd um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nWould have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that that would there be some serious incentives\nOne obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but\nWhat have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now all of her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not that was what I was not allowed to apply to any well we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee\nSo we have to accept that she is so we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter\nDoesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them or I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of a one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather actually talk a horse of being a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he took him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else it but and he took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay\nSo ... ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they may they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather mhm or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and we're getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I got to go in and say it's not ... ... my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true\nOh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing yellow yeah this is what it was but it was the was\nIt was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who's three horses over over balls\nI was her I almost made it into WWE but\nHow many times have you told us what you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never lose you you've you've yeah yeah yeah I get it I get it or she is you trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you'd better be right on these things and that's why I Can't give you that I got what it's about it I give you that I got a huge story I mean ... you know\nAnd with Elizabeth Warren doing this whole I'm Native American nobody cares nobody cares if she is nobody cares if she isn't\nI mean what difference does it make\nAnd so ... by playing into it\nShe's just making that about identity politics more and more and nobody cared enough people are done with identity politics I'm telling you they're done with it and the the the first candidate and well we already know the first candidate was Donald Trump that said I don't care I don't care\nI don't care what you say about me I don't care what you accuse me of I don't care that's why he won\nBecause he that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't walk this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side they're sick of it they're sick\nOf it now they may not like his extreme tweets and everything else but they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we are going to get rid of capitalism gives it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers man boy men\nAre trouble especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and that's really great I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because India\nShut up nobody cares\nWith all of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShut up the issue here is\nYou don't win that twenty twenty primary with twenty or thirty candidates in it without appealing to those activists who do believe all that craziness\nSo and there are so their stock they're hard wired incentivize right who when those people over early which is why they're all coming out and you know why the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the cabin I'll thing it's way ... on TV with you know with the crazy crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate you're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you\nModerate how do you go over to the side of anti ... and say hey I don't think anybody is wrong with that divide shout your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nCome back close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean the shell the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean advise cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nYou're you've been eaten you've been eaten by the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about shouting their abortion\nFox News some Chris foster secretary of state Mike Pompeo has met with Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince

had a written you an email and wanted to say thank you very much for being an inspiration [noise] um and I followed politics since I was eleven years old and I see it was well into the great minds in political commentary today\nAnd um [noise] recently I I saw an interview between you and Dan Shapiro yeah\nUm and he came out on and spoke about your past with alcohol and how that you had to enter a and I talk to you and struggling with alcohol myself um any of them being drunk when I watched that video [noise] um and I I stopped island you know this\nThis man with all the stress that he goes through a he's he's managed to overcome this problem and become a better person and really I've seen a good change in your personality I'm you become much more humble and so um because of your inspiration I decided to step out and go to AA myself\nAnd uh it's been a huge help\nTo lose your value when did you go to AA when did you just start about three weeks ago and you're still you're

you\nKnow it was um [noise] they're talking about the ... it was funny yeah of course it was it was really impacting ... D so honest I mean it is thought to be tough being in the public eye or something so personal and that that really hit me like a ton of bricks and um\nAnd then you are talking about the uh the the lady in your in your group that said oh\nHoney where all drunks in this room and I I you know I've always\nSeen a meetings is probably something lame or or people that wouldn't understand me or anything like that and that was the one moment that really turned my attitude and made me go I can walk in the door like and do this and I'll be in good company and I I found out to be true\nI'll tell you will I'm a ... meeting is different it just depends on where you are and if you don't find one that you relate to go find another one\nBecause they are we getting wildly wildly different walked into a a meeting in midtown Manhattan and uh you know I had a hard time relating to people because they literally were in the gutter and just coming out and I never experienced that and so it was it was different for me\nUm but you'll you'll find that people you relate to I'm so happy for you did did people in your life you know that you were having a problem will\n[noise] uh yes you know my my problems have been I'm\nA pretty obvious for a long time outs I've struggled with alcohol for uh almost Twenty years and uh I first I first got drunk and I was Fifteen I I've always struggled from self confidence issues which is kind of the under current that\nHasn't helped me [noise] and um when I was around Nineteen I was in a terrible relationship and had a bad breakup and and got into alcohol to kind of\nCope with it and try and get over it and get over the emotions\nAnd I'm ... I made a terrible drunk decision and kind of in retaliation I committed a crime and um my parents helped me through that time out in the counseling got me things that I needed [noise] but um\nWith their self confidence issues I I have a lot of self hatred that came from committing a crime and are coming out of that I was drunk or every day for about seven years you know and I held my life together\nI I Would sober up to go to work come home and just get tanked and start all over again and then I'm back in um there's two thousand eight I had a terrible accident I was drunk again uh messing around with fireworks\n... uh from Wyoming and lost a fifty percent of my left hand\nOh my gosh and that didn't [laughter] over up\nI soak it up for four years and I got married\nA guy who took on three step kids and walk into a different life rebuilt my relationship with God and I came to a point of stress says comes in marriage and um sell off the wagon\nAnd in the book there's a chapter of are we good or are we bad is this republic is the American experiment worth saving\nAnd we're not talking about that\nWe're seeing people tear it down but nobody who's talking about is it worth saving so how do we answer that question\nAnd the book goes through that and I think the road to recovery of of our ills in this nation start there\nYou know you you can say Hillary Clinton can say well I Can't compromise with people you know I Can't even talk to those people because they want to destroy everything I Believe in what what is that you believe in\nAnd and really believe in don't tell me the trait little things tell me about America tell me who you are now she can't do that because I don't I I just don't think that she's a she's\nHonest enough to tell me she's this is a politician sees a calculating and and so are most politicians right and left it's up to us we have to say that to our neighbors that we think we disagree with can we just can we not talk about politics for a second\nIs America worth saving is it a good place or a bad place and the book shows you how to have that conversation and gives you some some facts both on good and bad\nBecause both sides have to have to step to the plate both sides Republicans generally see rah rah all of the good things red white and blue and were patriotic because we believe and we don't want to hear the bad things because usually the bad things are being told to us by people who have the country\nWe have to go out and learn the bad things about the country and those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nI don't know about you but I'm both good and bad and my struggle every day is to be more good than bad to be a little better than I was yesterday and if I let myself go I'll be a bad guy well we've let our self go we're not trying to balance that anymore\nWe're saying we want to save this well why why what's worth saving what is it what are we saving\nAnd can you save quote the free market system [noise] by violating the free market system the answer to that is no\nSo what is it we're saving and is it worth saving and once we decide on that we'll know the path forward [noise]\n\nWant to thank our sponsor this half hour it's a ex chair just bought a new chairs for\nThe studio um and it's the next year do

mortgage right now\nAre you can drop mortgages and lower your interest rate it can take cash out kind of shift\nYeah well look at those to those two versions or wouldn't have been that different on a friday night the the guys who are looking for a fight they got in some extra kicks right and so that's maybe five seconds of violence that wouldn't have happened if they went your way\nThat's five seconds out of three days of terror or antifa was was threatening the venue they were giving ... threat to this old lady who answered the phone they're\nOkay hang on hang on we're starting to let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what I had and you have to hit on the poster because uh [laughter]\nI think the poster is just a entertaining but go ahead\nWell I Try it again the coach you killed so\nThat's where the samurai sword in Nineteen sixty and it's a funny trolls that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the tennis shaped thing for your rights free helicopter rides for comedies me early early satire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesdays call myself a toy again like Gabby\nAnd photo shop myself into his mug shot\nUm [noise] the second we announced that and anyone who knows me to know is that at that time and he goes full blast they start attacking the venue attacking the old lady there the calls are coming from all over the country by the way\nSo this is a planned attack that anti for his work I think the and the and the people are working hand in hand traditional as well organized and well funded\nSo then that those attacks continue night before the venue totally trashed windows smashed ridiculously pretentious manifesto nail to the door that says that we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA and then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos you're dismayed signed screaming hurling bottles of urine which one of them hit my car on the way out\nA ... ... organized rallies like there's this guy I met said you'll see if you really get deeper into the foxhole where he is calling anti science thing you know you guys go over there over there I citizen journalists get beat up\nTake his backpack their police to arrest him and then\nA way they arrest the citizen journalist\n... no no I'm Sorry to arrest three of the of the ten who mop this guy okay but I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks it seemed very military so\nThis isn't anarchy these anarchist start pulling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are um and to ah Austin is a ... on their\nFacebook page has called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a what do they call it a black shirt army or something a red or a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for\nPeople that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening and of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\n... that must be the Mets had guy that police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about 'em so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther King I mock them at their side of the same experience right up till now and it's been days\nAnd then it's time to leave I come out there I've got my plastic\nSword I make a for a yam a Gucci joke and that's when they ... may I jump in the car\nAnd then a group of Proud Boys are are the last ones to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter they were attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and a huge fight breaks out and now\nThan your world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nIn the Malcolm X world it's a little bit longer but again\nFive to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no ... NO PLAN it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon and uh you know Portland has I don't know who this mayor is what I mean\nWhat the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic and to follow the police are standing a block away and then they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with the super laughing towns like Berkeley in Portland is the mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say\nSorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos it happens when somebody likes Trump shows up when when Republicans and conservatives are around so it was just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping huh\nThat's their sort of a model and it works\nIt's interesting because ... because the initial video seemed to indicate that you guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from anti throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\n[noise] and it's strange how quick the media is to run\nWith the evil Nazi narrative without doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media takes up five second clip and makes that the total story when we have days and days and days or some subterfuge stays in the domestic violence\nIt's almost like I'm at I'm at a point now where I think they don't just like ... they are antifa I think a lot of these journalists these little hospital bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I uh I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have tried to be more moderating uh on my on my\nWords with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick 'em when they're down in all of this stuff are you there is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole\nA mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants Tucker Carlson just today said he can't go to restaurants and no known conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one\nAnd it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist like it it means absolutely nothing white supremacist as someone who sees white people as above all other races just inherently better and wants all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly esoteric\nView to have it's it's a crazy if you to have and they just throw it on it and it sticks like glue\nAnd it affects our families affects our lives affects our personal lives\nThere's gotta be some culpability there\nOkay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to own a take you over across the break in and just\nAsk you what it is you believe what is the America then you see and that your fighting for [noise] back was Gavin begin is coming up and just a second let me tell you a little bit about gold lying if you\nThink this stuff is going away quickly it's not a if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress we are in we're in for a real wild ride um they are going to subpoena the tax records\nAnd when they don't get the tax records from the White House the White House will bring it to the Supreme Court and then the uh Democrats will say the Supreme Court doesn't have the you know doesn't have a right to do this because of\nOf ah Kavanaugh on and cabinet needs to recuse himself and he's not going to recuse himself then they're going to try to impeach cabin on and they all impeach ... Donald Trump I mean it's\nThis what's happening this is what's happening these people are playing for keeps and they are not paying attention to things like oh I don't know the economy isn't as any really heard you know I see the tweets from Donald Trump all the time I see all the stuff they're saying about Donald Trump has anybody really heard\nWhat's going on with the stock market\nDoes anybody really paying attention to what's happening with Saudi Arabia that's a pretty big deal especially when you look at the price of oil a anybody pay attention that nope not in the media\nMine is put together a I'm a report for you on all of the scenarios that could happen if they take one or both of the houses and they're they're pretty ... you need to be aware of\nHotel the Associated Press police found evidence that ... was killed South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham tells boxing on sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYou know we deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo has met today with Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince about showed Jesus appearance in Idaho fish and game commissioner has resigned over a hunting trip\nWhite fish or send photos to friends and co workers from his hunting trip and Africa which included pictures of him standing over a family of bamboo ... that he killed Fisher also reportedly shot a giraffe a leopard and an empowerment\nFox is Jeff and also on Wall street that was up two hundred twenty eight point this is Fox News [noise]\nTheir parents were using them and then he reassured them that quote in the future if somebody race false allegations against them with no proof they shouldn't worry that they would be okay\nEven thank the ship erosion went about his business the infuriated mother continued to yell screaming Nick Cassidy should be ashamed for not believing women and for ruining her daughters lives\nThe Shapiro it looks like there's only one person ruining their lives\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening for ... [noise]\nYou know in the in the book addicted outrage I [noise] I\n... some people who haven't read the book I think that it is about um a surrendering or or just making friends with the left and it's done that's not what this is about at all\nIt's about knowing what you believe and then taking a strong stand but with a different approach because times have changed\nAnd um and they're getting more and more dangerous and I have talked to you\nAbout Martin Luther king for a long time or a somebody who wrote a read my book who [noise] um I really respect they they read it and they said a\nYear about a year to a head I'm not sure um maybe maybe because I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and crazier maybe but it's not about\nIt's not about reuniting with the left to 'cause I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in washing I'm not talking about political people I'm Talking about your neighbors\nFor the first thing we have to do is unite with each other we have to unite people people who are are on the right part of the spectrum need to come together we have to come together\nAnd I'm I'm really I I'm I don't like the hey you're on the train or you're not on the train what he's talking about what train where's the train going\nHere's the train that we should all be on\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place people die\nIn the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out if you work hard you're smart and you're a little bit lucky you can break out\nYou can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates that's America that's great\nThat's why people come here and we're losing sight of that and so the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving and I think the answer across the board I'll bet you eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving so what does that mean well capitalism\nCapitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution but we haven't been on the constitution or the bill of rights in a long time but we do need a rule of law\nLet me start asking you know just a few questions and I don't care who you voted for I don't care what side of the aisle you're on just answer yes or no\nDo you hate men\nDo you hate white people do you hate black people do you hate Jews do you hate cops do you hate capitalism\nDo you want to shout down others that have a different opinion\n\nDo you want to shout down God or hate God\n\nDo you believe street violence is the way we solve things in America\nIf you answered yes to any of those things I don't think I have much in common with you but I don't care who you voted for I'll bet you the vast majority said no to all of those things and it wasn't hard well I don't know it was no no no no no no no no\nThat's who we are\nThose are the people you need we need to unite\nWith but the easy ones to get by the ones on our own side\nGetting the Guinness and I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I I Believe that it would be\nMuch more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and walk through Atlanta FAA singing hymns and let them club you wouldn't have had go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and knocked punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least ill at this point we'll choose good\nCyber criminals can attack your laptop your

us about a half hour ago the program and you listen when I said what so what is it you believe in what is the America that you see\nI don't see anything that should be shut down I don't think I don't see anything that is dangerous or or any good that comes out from silencing\nNot only him but you know even a crazy man like Alex Jones but cabin is not saying things that are dangerous you know\nWe've always said more voices not less less uh or probably should be not fewer I get those computers I think it is [laughter] but uh you want I mean that's the whole thing here you're supposed to be able to talk about these things openly with people that you disagree with\nAnd ideally right like if you care about something in your passionate about it you're working on persuading someone else yes right yeah um I don't know that you can get into a situation\nWhere you're on the streets talking to ... that anyone could ever get convinced if anything no so I mean I it's not that's not where I direct to my attention typically but I understand that like you can't have a if I Lived in Portland right now I Would be happy\nThat a organizations were showing up to defend me against anti ...\nUm I I can see that you know when you get to you get to this point and you you mentioned this earlier when we talked about it in both the twenty Fifteen in Alabama about how\nSo he wasn't exposed and the fact is I Believe a yes or every country that has relations a whip Thursday of a has a reason to be concerned because we still don't have any clarity on how will be a ...\nGovernment so you don't know exactly what's coming he he\nGrew up in a time where there was military rule in Brazil and that was that was overthrown a and democracy came and he has him to the in the past that\nUh that's the way you know you should run a government he has he has called for ... ... what are the Ninety nine a civil war um and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians\nHe is extraordinarily divisive but he is not he's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least he has in the past correct\nAnd he's surrounded by ... so a\nA haste closest advisors today are a military so as an exception is a\nFollow get just a that is appointed as his ministers economy this guy is a liberal so we have several different says regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's ... he he's a liberal and he uh comes\nAs he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man that he points that\nOut as a base of the trust in his government but\nUh he said he uh ... it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews\nOr saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so uh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very close government regarding depressed for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tools [noise]\n... ... this is the kind of ... kind of the same thing that you go ... said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and uh nationalizing everything is ... is there um\n... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him that is the military and is it when you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy as hey we'll uh take office\nAnd immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected that maybe he could uh promote some change in constitution\nAnd it is not clear how he would do it he has a\nSuggested that he could create a council that would ah create a new constitution for Brazil and that would be submitted a to a vote or after it so and in ... to to people to uh like in\nSo if he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office\nBecause the fact is that he's not going to debate he uh is giving I'm just a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation from the press\nAnd this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but a analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time including because uh in the legislative election\nHe got a a strong a performance in eh from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some\nSome level of ability and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what what do those changes\nCome it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nA death wish I had a son it ... and he posted online a while back a photo\nOf him a next to ban in and said that Bannon as said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this\nAt this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a great part of a sudden out of strategy but a lot of himself a came to public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it\nWhat we know fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ...\nAn expression of this right wing movement in bed with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's a it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's ... presidential candidates an\nA and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow that we don't know exactly at what point\n... Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth or will have the final result it's very likely dead considering the current polls that bill sonata we'll be elected\nUh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave also now fifty nine percent of valid\nVotes and set it ended that it that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one so it's a big ... and I'm both an idle at poll after poll has indicated that\nAre here to like to ferry sure of their votes so and we we would have to have a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario and\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and find out uh some more we'll be following okay thank you so much for ... appreciated okay\nThank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history or he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and uh he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's a change demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator\nYou know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that is we should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobble together this um populist movement and\nGoing wait I I I think they shop her up in that case it's a woman I think they dropped her up and took her away in the middle of the night and it was like no that's crazy mhm well it turns out it was\nAnd uh and it's the same thing here somebody sitting outside going I think they dropped him up and took a mountain suitcases it's it is the Hitchcock\nRear window and this is obviously gone very arrive for the Saudis because you don't do things like this and expect to admit to and interrogation gone wrong two weeks later\nLike this is something you do and you deny me Russia does this all the time they're constantly killing journalist and they're like I don't even know who I don't even know what that was what is ... Loni andme I've never even heard of the thing and you know like that that their pattern and they never admitted if Saudi Arabia actually comes out of the ... yeah\nWe kinda killed that journalists that's a big moment\nOr in you know geopolitics that's not a it's not a tiny thing today\nOr how today or tomorrow the way the president answers Saudi Arabia when\nWhen they admit to doing this this is an ally a this is one of our bigger backers this is probably our best friend next to Israel in the middle east they stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there are a big supporter now of Israel\nUm we're in a proxy war in Yemen with that most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen\nAt their request and they're fighting with us\nUm they keep Iran at bay we're about to sell them a whole busload of arms they also don't money into our tech industry ... right now because of this um they also dump a lot of money into our banking system a hillside that cool or herb\nThat what we should say that's a pretty sweet shore okay the or predict do we know that and how they don't ask the or why hasn't anyone interviewed the or about this incident notice how the orbit is\nA show Shashi stuffed inside of it [laughter] stuff inside of how they ... they hide\nSo um what is the president do what do we do\nThis way you don't get involved in these things 'cause it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did we don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nCertainly feels different but couldn't help me quantify the difference here for a minute these regimes are killing people all the time yes we know bad things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not an innocent of these things yes is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on foreign territory in an embassy is\nIt just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happened to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue because they can go after a cushion her and and and Trump because of the relationship what ... what do you think\nThey say yes on all of that I'd say yes to all of them 'cause um I don't think if this guy was a preacher\nNobody would have been paying attention and rarely did we got one back and no one yeah nobody seemed to care of this one because it's one of there's\nA the press cares more about it but also foreign soil and you know the suitcase thing it's a brain he got ... story\nFifty [noise]\nFox News some Chris foster secretary of state Mike Pompeo was met with Saudi Arabia's king and cram friends about the disappearance of journalist your market show in Turkey two weeks ago\nHawkish officials tell a the police did find evidence in the Saudi comes at that Saudi columnist to show you was killed that they call it by mystic show he was last seen on the second of October with such by tax investigated for nine hours on Monday Night for the first time\nNow reports to suck everything that the Saudis may be preparing to admit that Mr to show you died and the result of an interrogation that went wrong that's\nFox is Benjamin hall in as symbols turkey the death of a woman in her four children all shot at their home in Columbia, Tennessee is being treated as a murder suicide\nWe don't believe there can be anyone out a a suspect out that ah that is taken the lives of these individuals\nSure Bucky rolling says a family member found the bodies and the father wasn't home at the time the kids were\nThree girls and avoid to sixteen years old [noise] this is Fox News [noise]\nAnd I saw the envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms of\nWhat they mean it's so confusing well it was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying\nFor them to do [noise] [noise] Mm [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nBest client that probably and those who can you help me war game that's been talked about this Saudi Arabia\nThing because right now Congress is saying we want to slap major sanctions on them\nOkay [noise] um you know where we're at a point to where uh I said you know back in the early to thousands you're going to get to a point where if you haven't dealt with these problems it's going to be too late and there isn't going to be a single good option you are not going to like the options and so right now\nYou have people saying yeah ours is Star Wars we're not going to sell them the arms more got slapped sanctions on they admit this this is horrible and it is it is and that's probably what America should do however let me play devil's\nAdvocate oil is already up at eighty some some ah oil is headed up to a hundred dollars a barrel\nWe've pretty much shut down the Texas oil reserves were I mean we're slowing them down because of the price of oil they couldn't make enough money so they kind of slow them down we have to open those things back up again which we can do\nBut we're not held hostage by oil but a spike as severe spike a hundred twenty a hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's what collapsed us last time in two thousand eight was a spike to a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you also have turkey\nThis is coming from turkey and ... um turkey is no fan of Saudi Arabia um the balance of power with turkey is a little frightening economic\nFrankly the Saudi royal uh funds are big in Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons why our stock market it's taking a hit at least in the tech sector\nBecause they think if this goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where they're going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was a easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that it's you know can hurt the industry\nYou also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check on um uh on Iran if they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor in that\nI mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan there's others that are that I Would say are better options but would that amount of power yes and uh you know ... again credibility in the Arab world obviously Israel\nDoesn't necessarily have that um but you know Saudi Arabia you know is a is the big\nA sort of backstop right so what do we do can stop the worst of the things that are as an ... year presidents presidents do\nWhat do you do today I uh [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nOr resigned [laughter] I Know ah I I think um you have to figure out first of all we need I Would certainly the first thing I Would do is have more information that I currently do um so I\nThink we're over there were the king of the king says she's screw up total screw up this\nGuy who they were out of control you know I wanted and brought over here they got out of control they started torturing him for answers he died\nAnd then they just chopped them up put them in a suitcase yes all of that stuff is true and I can't believe in these guys they've all they're already dead [laughter] or whatever or you know but yes we did it\n... I mean\nI think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then\nI remember there was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here is that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist is that let's let's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "16"}
