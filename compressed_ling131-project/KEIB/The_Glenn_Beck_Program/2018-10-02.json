{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "Twenty one thousand dollars there was sculptures price like five bedroom home we actually found to fancy sculptures out at Palo Alto California at a VA medical center that third line veteran costs the American taxpayer seven hundred thousand dollars\n[noise] let's put this in the prospect of eastern or serving blind veterans has a seven hundred thousand dollar piece horn on the wall\nWith sculptures and also there was a third one it was a kid rock sculpture all in with landscaping that caught one point two million dollars\nThese findings went to the Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley Grassley wrote a three page oversight letter to then secretary Robert McDonald McDonald took thirty days but he apologized for the purchases and instituted a new rules to stop the abuse go forward\nYou know but it really tells you a lot the website is open the books dot com it really tells you a lot\n... you could make a new provision new regulation that says you can't waste money like this anymore the VA ... for instance vi he can no longer by art installations of sculpting and you can no longer spend more than point oh one percent of construction on landscape you could make any regulation you want any provision\nBut at the end of the day the mindset that thought that was okay\nIs not going away and that's more troubling\nWell Michael you're exactly right month after the apology the Palo Alto communications director called a press conference in front of that ugly one point two million dollar rock sculpture\nAnd he said these things are necessary to create a new arena environment for our veterans locally they never backed away from it\nWill know and I'll bet you having served on Houston city council I'll bet you that whoever the artist is that that was commissioned to create that sculpture is somebody involves sister lover husband\nA business partner ... those things are never as simple as just commissioning a piece of art it's always a way to redistribute wealth to contributors supporters friends and family\nAnd what every veteran listening to your program today needs to understand so twenty fourteen so in Phoenix um there was actually thirty two hundred employees of the Phoenix the eighth ... while these well forty veteran actors so\nWe we took a look at our data we we wanted to ask the question how many doctors\nFloyd and there was only two hundred and twenty seven doctors out of three thousand two hundred employees these things were employment farm there not medical system in the in the years that have gone to\nCongress through tens of billions of dollars at the d._a. we track what they did with it and they they've actually added to the pay roll over sixty thousand new position and less than seven thousand new doctors have been added\nYou know it it it's more of the same\n... disturbing it really is ... ... one of the charts that you produced a that I thought was powerful raised the question who has more firepower US Marines versus bureaucrats what did you find there\nWe found that there are now over two hundred thousand federal bureaucrats with arrest and fire I'm forty and there's only a hundred and eighty thousand United States marine\nSpecific to the VA ... police force in Nineteen Ninety six they relied on like hospitals do on the local police agencies to provide security\nWell that change starting in Nineteen Ninety six and today the VA has approximately thirty two hundred police officers again while they're failing on their core mission while they're written and reading at the secret social program is to provide basic health care to the men and women who fought for us\nThey've uh they've spent nearly twenty million dollars over the course last nine years on gun mission and military style equipment to arm their police force every single year they spend about two hundred two hundred million dollars on salaries for their police force\nOpen the books dot com is where you'll find Adams were one of your ah one of the articles you see you've been on Fox a lot in the ... in Newsweek one of the stories was Pentagon rushes to spend billions before into month one of the things I found in local government but I'm I'm I'm sure it's true in state and federal as well\nIs that once money is allocated in a budget it's going to be spent otherwise you lose it in next year's budget to what extent is that happening how big a problem is that\nHuge problem so we found it last year on the use it or lose it a blow to spread the federal agencies\nIncredibly Michael one out of every dollar of contractual spanning the executive agencies were spent in the last week they spent fifty billion dollars I mean we found small things like the United States Army\nBrought it Centers for about seven thousand dollars you could buy a lot better for seven grand you know they brought a shuffle board adult\nBoard snowboard you know tens of thousands of dollars they bought a thirty five thousand dollar arcade machine over health and Human Services in one of the last transactions ... by the\nBy a comp price when he was a secretary they bought it read them armored limit ... and they spent one point five\nMillion dollars on Leno's\nWhat kind of arcade games was it like ms ... [laughter]\nYou know I mean you know I didn't mean rightfully it's a big party and we actually proved it was a big party the state department's than a hundred and fifty grand on whiskey and wine\nOr don't judge I might have spent that much\nAnd thank you for the good work you're doing you can contribute to his cause you can sign up for his newsletter you can read his reports his name is Adam Angie as ski you'll never learn how to spell it but you can find him and open the books dot com open the books dot com appreciate your time I'm asked\nMe to Michael thanks for having me on\nThere you have it All right we'll put a link to that on our website at Michael berry dot com you can always send me an email at Michael berry show dot com you can also send remote an email and it says on their sin remote indirect email our podcasts are available they're free wherever you get your podcasts\nA including through our website and Michael berry dot com we do read our emails to come in\nThanks for listening and thanks for telling a friend [noise]\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion pop are not empty people ask me how you\nKeep competing in the age of Seventeen healthy living is important which so he's pain if you have said you can't train so improves I discovered salon ... plus this unique topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing has worked better for\nSalon ... plus cream or wrong\nWaking up along the rights to this is Sean Hannity\nMorning minute after two years of trying to destroy the president you know they want a Christian do their way back\nInto power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous we've got this election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels and you got to be watching the news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy angers all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world\nAnd you're going to defy the odds and you're sick of their agenda there's blood thinning of cabin all this the agenda that just destroyed trumps the agenda of higher taxes they want their crumbs back\nThe agenda of open borders and eliminating ice the agenda of keeping Obamacare the agenda of\nMedicine to rape me cry when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with aids list male Macs a patent pending formula within a greedy and that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases muscles size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide\nNor originalist on the board they want judicial\nActivists from the from coast to coast from seed to shining see Sean Hannity show\nTo prevent muscle cramps and your legs and feet use their works relief now there's non greasy pole was proven to relieve muscle cramps fast and reduce muscles ... there were works relief only takes ... minutes do apply it absorbs quickly and it really works try their works relief to your family your friends like the results will speak for themselves\nWhether it's our hearts lungs or other organs were diagnosis tends to make us uneasy at Kaiser Permanente our specialists care for you and about working together and creating a treatment plan specific to your diagnosis and total health\nFrom primary to specialty can find reinsurance and a great team of health care professionals committed to you were healthy recovery visit he beat out or knows\nNow this is a life changing product you don't even need a prescription get their works relief today and the pain oil at Walmart CBS Rite Aid Walgreens pharmacies or just go to the website there were works relief dot com\nMissiles ... kills you just taken lives destroyed families in ruins childhoods\nWe need to take action immediately the missile field a patient registry active twenty Seventeen we create a patient registry for researchers cancer and a a less of a missile researchers needed to we need to find a cure for this devastating disease for more information on this\nBipartisan bill visit I save team dot org\nSave team dot org\nJ.

New York times\nThis story does not live up to the even the editorial standards of the New York times someone through ice in Nineteen eighty five\nReally God Forbid you ever go to Philadelphia now\nEmily the writer of this story hurt tweets make it obvious that she's opinionated against Brett Kavanaugh so now the New York times has been talked publishing a supposed journalist being an activist and this is not mistake\nHow did this story gets really editorial staff\nWell easy I Believe they're probably activists as well their activists and this just goes to show his temperament call ... ... you know somebody might come in and say hey I'm fighting for abortion and the court\nHe might just take a glass of ice and and throw it at that person\nGet used to it America we have a full week of this as we get closer to the vote the ridiculous this escalates to a full on clown show ... probably by this afternoon\nNow a clown show in the media leading up to a circus in the Senate\n[laughter] you know what I guess nothing has changed but this time can I at least get some cotton candy\nHer [noise]\nCan you stay on the numbers or going back program [noise] All right\nSo [noise] do [noise]\nI'm a little disturbed but All right [noise] I Know I Know\nAh the ah the goalposts man they just they just keep moving them [laughter] I mean they must be tired but I think\nIt's ... they're they're heavy they the goalposts are getting heavier and have you ever hear that because there's a lot of the farther you move the harder it is to justify\nOr is it this is incredible um uh though I Am very disturbed of course by these new allegations against Brett Brett Kavanaugh that he ... through frozen water at someone for the first of all or can it can be heavy um\nYou know what it means people are like oh it's not a big deal so what do you through ice frozen water can be dangerous tell that to the people of Peru work twenty two thousand people were killed in an avalanche in Nineteen Seventy to those people that don't really\nSee this is why he's done on the Supreme Court look at look at his temperament you don't have the temperament to be anywhere near that microphone\nMr ... I Do have the um the temperament to be on the ... a team however I ... I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that\nThey spent on these teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how they look it's it's certainly\nOn its own this is their fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court said for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWell what it what it does say when it does is that it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his anger when he was\nDrinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I never met anyone reached further I Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name\nWithout me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly I did not have sexual relations with that ... thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful this\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here's my sleeve T to Donald Trump\n\nFirst of all\nDon't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it\nNo other president in my lifetime would have stuck are stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings\nThere's no way they would have said the cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship doom not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWith that being said and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those those charges turned out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony they're no longer on that yeah nobody in like a she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she\nTime they used her as a pivot to something new okay so there there there's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out this FBI there they're not saying that they're not\nNobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was and I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything budding [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury you watch that's by the end of the week that's what they'll be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump\nThe only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference\nThat you say you know he he you know quit or vote went down all went down in ... or an down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't need how long did it do take to do to the ... sessions a vow\nOr I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February ate he was the vote went down so let it for weeks and three or four weeks for an hour we could probably could have a fast rate other things going on I'm\nGay so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks the one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that\nIs likely it's already been done he's the only under get done that quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list\nYes so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select him let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow which I wouldn't\nChange accident but it could happen I mean it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy would they were fighting on the ... yeah I was trying to run if that happens to Kevin\nWell this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering a the New York times by plane but anyway so let's just say and it makes him into sausage ...\nUh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is a ... pro life uh and he would vote\nBut I mean the the bottom line is he cares about the constitution that anything I mean you will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough or here's Mike Lee\nGot done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless don't understand capitalism a think that it's been banned meaning and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how ... works\nRush Limbaugh this morning at nine on the Patriot am eleven fifty you're listening to the patriots am eleven fifty [noise]\nFox News

the future we'll give those two year and a second we want to go over some of the the things that people now are saying about Brett Kavanaugh and not the ridiculous the stuff I I'd rather I'd rather a focus on\nTwo things\nThis extra week was to find out if the uh the Ford thing was real I don't think that's real if it is real if they're if they come up with credible evidence that it's real he's out you agree with that\nToo yeah I think if somehow they were able to prove that he did something or really make you believe he did yeah I mean it was credible evidence if it's it's if it is preponderance of evidence if it you know the details matter but yes you're speaking yes okay a perjury\nThis is what they're going for now this is what Jeff Flake has bought and what he purchased a was an extra week for the media and the Democrats to move the goalpost and now the goal posts are moving the goalposts\nNow our duty perjured himself did he lie under oath and not about not about a a professor forward\nWhat about what was written in his ... book ... so here are the things that they are saying and and you have to say it is this\nWould this rise to the level\nOf perjury All right go ahead\nAnd I I Want to warn you we're about to use highly technical medical terms and if you are this maybe go a little bit over your head that's OK stick with us okay judge Kavanaugh's yearbook page included the entries judge have you both to yet\nHave you moved the\nDevil's triangle on Thursday he said booth meant flatulence and that the devil's triangle was drinking game in which three glasses were arranged in a triangle\nUm this is disputed according to the New York times I Want to make sure that you understand that I'm reading from what from what is supposedly the greatest newspaper ever created they are they're talking about whether the word means flatulence or not [noise]\nBoth in the Nineteen eighties was a term that often referred to um [noise] ... well like a technical terms anal sex and this is how judge Kavanaugh's classmates said they interpreted his comment they said they had never used it before\nAs it referred to flatulence okay now the term booth Glenn wasn't term that I Do remember from my uh from my I Would say elementary\nSchool days oh ... oh well you know that was before ... maybe I mean it was like I don't think necessarily knew what it meant but I feel like it had a sexual connotation to it\nHow or what I found it interesting is as I was telling him talking to you about this this morning before the show and assuming that everyone would understand that is what it meant you had a totally different understanding of the word\nWell I wasn't the hip is\nSo new [laughter] so I don't know if you have that but I I seem to remember is something\nI don't recall but I think we used to you know getting stoned or something I I I Can't remember the ... getting your style and getting stoned something like that maybe okay I I I Believe ...\nYeah I mean like I was

their way\nWas judge Kavanaugh had another incident that's come up\nFrom Kavanaugh's bass Fox's Rachel Sutherland live in Washington\nThe judge Kavanaugh through I said a man at a bar in New Haven Connecticut in Nineteen eighty five when he was a student at Yale that's according to a police report to which names Kavanaugh's a participant in a brawl after you be forty concert at a place called ...\n\nI feel bad for this woman I really do\n\nShe goes on these rats quite often by the way\n\nShe doesn't like Brett Kavanaugh she doesn't like President Trump the reason why I bring her up is well a Twitter you get a kick her off are you going to kick her off\nIf this is and if this if this isn't the epitome of threats I don't know what is that she really typified the [noise] the insanity that has overtaken the left\nNo amount in evidence in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind\nAnd you know what I I I really I can\nUnderstand how you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed with this on ending hatred and there's nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it\nYou're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yep no I'm not God today might be your turn\nUnless your God you don't know that you cannot know that I mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me judge last you'll be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves\nBut that requires evidence that requires some sort of of case to be made not accusations but a case to be made\nHere destroying a person's life see here's the problem\nWith this particular professor at Georgetown\nShe's looking for social justice\nShe's looking for ... uh to be righted somehow or another and it doesn't matter all men are guilty all men are guilty well I'm Sorry was Gandhi guilty was ... he guilty\nReally\n'cause he was a man was Martin Luther king was he guilty\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men uh they had one was a alleged land or the other\nWas a clear racist gundy I still think they were great men there were just flawed\n\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors\nWhen you go down that road you always always end up killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying we should feed their genitals to the pigs\nTell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric and what a surprise once again it's coming from the elites in the universities\nAre\n...\n... ...\nIt's really hard really very very hard\nTo [noise] ooh\nRemain [noise]\nReasonable when the world is unreasonable\nBut we must\nWe must because no one will listen to any message if we are just hurling insults\nIf we are fighting fire with fire it will change no one's mind if you don't believe me\nHow many minds did we change\nDid we change the course\nOf two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monsters saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right\nSo\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them\nIt's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just saw you're crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way and as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election\nI was wrong on multiple occasions but what amazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's\nFoolish you do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others\nPlease don't do that to others who say you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are at least make in some sense please do not rubbed their oh well we told you so well really remember when you\nDon't do that please don't do that will come them\nWe're going to heal the nation the first thing they have to do is peel the right we're going to heal the nation we have got to put our differences aside and begin to open up our circle\n\nIf I Believe in eighty percent of the stuff you believe in grade I don't even need to do that I just need to know do you believe in the bill of rights do you believe in the bill of rights if you believe in the bill

ways this Kavanaugh thing can come down and do I love your help on this I'm going to give you a few scenarios and you tell me\nYou tell me if they're crazy or not we'll do that and then the second\nI only see one way\nOnly a one way\nThat ends\nKind of for a while Mm\nDo this and just a second now from\nHurricanes to earthquakes and cyberwarfare every American should have a plan to get through an

Hi David how are you\nI'm well thanks for having me bad oh appreciate your bigger guy than people think are no\n[laughter] so I thank you for that I think it was a fat joke that I go to a yeah a\nDavid before we go into your book here to build and just get give me a minute on your take on Kavanaugh and what's going to happen\nI think he's going to get through and I think um I think this is one of the ugliest smears we've seen in at least in my life ... covering politics and thinking about politics and I think it's gonna backfire and that it's really brought together\nNever most of the never Trump hers and all this sort of disparate parts of the right and rightly so and um\n[noise] and if not I I was listening to before I think the Trump has to be ready for that and they have to push through someone else because the courts especially when you have a divided\nPolitical environmental as you do today the ... the Supreme Court's incredibly important and uh you know that he's we there was a rifle seat there for ... for for the conservative and the Trump should do what he has to do to get through\nWhat do you think about what do you think about Mike Lee as everyone knows him you don't need the FBI you could vote in a week\n[laughter] [laughter] I Love the idea I mean and you know he is not going to like wander off\nAnd go hardcore so I'm very happy [laughter] okay so let's talk about let's talk about your book the thing I like about your book is that you do not a shy away from America's gun culture\n[noise] yeah I think we talk a lot about the politics of gun out of his guns and they say it's important the ideology behind it but I think a lot of people miss the culture behind the\nHundreds of years of of of imbedded culture not just not just in war but in in commerce\nAnnie and in just the individual lives of Americans and how important it was and how that is in our DNA and that's why we talk about guns the way we do so\nBecause I grew up in New York and in concert alien to my you know neighborhood and place I grew up in West criminals had them or I thought it was important to try to figure out what that was about and ah you know that's what the books about\nWow so so how did you I mean what did you find I I didn't know that you were you know ... is part of the gun culture I grew up in the gun culture if you will my grandfather my uncles we you know they'd go hunting and fishing and we always had guns around\nA and it takes on a different meaning to me and to people who grew up around them what did you find\nRight I mean you know where I grew up every you know if you mentioned guns or if someone had a gun that immediately think about it in a negative way not something that would be positive so [noise]\nUh you know just a personal story my my dad I little jewelry store in New York and it was a robbed and uh right after that my dad tried to get a gun and it was you know it's painstaking process of trying to get to protect your own property\nAnd your own work and your own family so that's I think when I started turning towards you know they're having a curiosity about what it was about and then when I moved to Denver lived in Colorado and other places\nI saw what it was really about and um and how people treated it and how like an end are a member is the most responsible person on her first you know when it comes\nTo gun so uh yeah and I don't know if that people\nKnow they don't have they don't understand that at all hum it take me through some of the stories that you you talk about because I Would I like about this this is not a gun is not a book about um you know necessarily the laws and everything else this is a story about America and how\nWe we do have I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam cold or or buffalo bill who am I ...\n... ... one of the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and

I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's I think it's absolutely in line with the cat was like well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst in there and saying but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this happen often yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to

they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the tire efforts of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism ... explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things that that didn't make any sense and there's an easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basis of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories of the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way a\nAnd the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh end of the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy\nAnd to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting a radically and there's some reason and you don't understand that why would they do that they blow their job why they do this they blow their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it yeah\nIt is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight the right way just know who your enemy is the tactics\nThat they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if

[noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise] Mm\n[noise] Mm [noise]\n... at the Glenn Beck command All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin ... which again\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you and stuff but the area important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general and ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up on because there's\nJust certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused a by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the capital case in the aisles the case\nOf the cabinet case happens ah thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay\nAll right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we do not remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between forward and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does what did she\n... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases you have the the Ford case with something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling that would never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison teeth Allison's I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things one\nHas notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this\nGuy you they'll usually leading me yeah and she and you know and\nAnd one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident ... has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of those that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she had named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax uh writings um the pictures\nAnd they are those are things that she showed two co workers in real\nTired real time it had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at\nThat time yeah but but but lives and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well it was yesterday or take\nNo we haven't seen it yet though ha ha now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet\nI'm of course there's no video of the cabinet thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the veil and\nRight and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I don't have any him out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case the however um what's interesting about this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "02"}
