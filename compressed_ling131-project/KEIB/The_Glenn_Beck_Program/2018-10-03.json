happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to pay a set up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nAh and I read so much I read it all on tend to but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because he watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're ... if you're in China in the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concerns\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized server and only the hands of you know the the the two or three companies um\nThat dominate these markets\nThen there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um these works\nIn an air and it was a movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know that the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decides that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise] um oh my\nGosh so they almost force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and uh you know fully restored but you still have the old copy now that's right you can't ... I mean even ... I mean think of this even just for comparison\nYou can if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed in our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they were originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was\nThe consumer good will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally when these services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own sort of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm with the Apple TV for example\nAt the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their classical servers\nExactly I'm Sorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded if something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nOr so is it allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nBut because the Kendal is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it moves those files strong\nMuslim Hubble can you talk about all go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years do chew and a different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forced everybody to have it exactly\nIt's bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\n... it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you\nHave that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk of but a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and they will come back and get you to answer that question a and it just the change in\nIn capitalism

talked about the debt\nI don't know what's gonna happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean\nThere if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of work together and figure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex coin which is is this bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it

going back program [noise] one\nOf my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds it Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right\nName for it [laughter] it is that actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nDoesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and make money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it and Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes\nPart of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premise of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us into directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country\nDoing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very uh you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's a real problem no you're\nYou're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't like you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us the press certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed this out in the open you have combat and by the way fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of\nJesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted different wet I wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter] but you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you\nKnow people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why we'll you'd I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good and you know\nThat it's not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy

government accountability Institute producer of a new documentary that his out you find it at the\nCreepy line dot com um\nThe creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google that you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line have terrified beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I Want to I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business area but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back and first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning they blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the ... the scope and size at Google ... wait a minute how if if the ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using a Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but is your company ... you know it may be John Smith acme incorporated dot com\nBut his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert ... signed this scholar who's been critical of Google\nA Clinton supporter a Clinton supporter a harbor PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this is back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech on general or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of those emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being that have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use Gmail well you know\nGoogle is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however they are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research\nSo Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nThere's ... this is just at the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people that you just look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy mhm pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter]\nThey had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then after like an hour or two they gave the leaves system the picture of
