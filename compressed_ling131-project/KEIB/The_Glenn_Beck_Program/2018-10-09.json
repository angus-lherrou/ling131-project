{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "According to the report released by the house intelligence committee in April of this year\nMichael Sussman a partner at the firm Perkins coy told then FBI general counsel James Baker about the alpha bank server activities before the two thousand six than a lecture\nHe apparently shared the information with the slate journalist who wrote the story about the suppose it's secret server\nAnd guess what\nJames Baker the former FBI general counsel testified behind closed doors closed doors last week so we don't know what other GM's he has released\n[noise] but rest assured\nLong as congressional Republicans retained the house so that they can keep dragging these FBI officials before them there are so many sordid details that still need to be unpacked\nAnd for those of you are frustrated and rightfully so recognized this\nWe're dealing with the FBI yeah we're dealing with the highest levels including the director of the FBI\nAnd his top tier of officials unpacking what they've done is not an easy thing\nIt's not an easy thing at all it's a dangerous thing it's a frightening thing but that process is underway\nAnd I think some of them if they haven't already been done to correct I think if congressional Republicans will keep the heat on them\nI think that you will see some of them beginning to crack especially if it looks like the pressure is on them [noise] my fear is we're twenty nine days from election day if Republicans don't hold the house and I think they will\nIf Republicans don't hold the house\nThen Nancy Pelosi becomes a speaker and any investigation into the FBI and the Democrat Party and Hillary's campaign the DNC and the media\nAny and all investigations into that\nAs the driven by Congress will evaporate\nAnd the sad sad reality is that we may never know exactly what happened we may still never know but it gives me ...\nA joy to know that those FBI officials at the top ranks who were part of this or squirming\nPeter ... with his little whimpering ways and Coby Coby has to have at his core of fear that the things he was up to\nWill be disclosed he has to deep down worry because Donald Trump is not a shrinking violet\nIn if he gets the goods on co me he's going to pursue it it's personal and we're at the point now where Trump is shown he does not fear these people these into deep he he\nIs not walking away from the Bruce or isn't the Peter straws extend the Rod Rosenstein genes\nAnd Bob Mueller by the way whereas our Russian collusion here we are closing in on two years where's that Russian collusion\n[noise] I don't care about how much money they spent because it's a drop in the bucket for the federal government and I actually think that you do investigations when they're warranted this one wasn't\nTo arrive at the truth\nAnd the cost to society is far greater than the cost of an investigation\nIf you've got corruption run 'em up\nBut I don't think this investigation into Trump was being done in good faith I think it was based on planted in a plant that information I think they knew that there was nothing there I think this was intended to be able to harass him which it has done\nTo his credit he he's managed to accomplish as as Mary Madeleine said nothing short of a miracle what he has accomplished\nBut I Will leave you with a bit of uncertainty and that is what will Mueller do in the next twenty nine days\n\nI Do not want to be part of the problem in America and I fail on that all the time we all do\n\nBut what counts is the effort what counts is are you crying are you crying\nAnd are you better today than you were yesterday have you found any answers or are you only shouting things down\nOr you just out in the street directing traffic\nBecause you feel it's your right well have you even look at what your rights mean where do your rights even come from today I saw I think progress right\nAt whole article about how the constitution has failed that was the headline the constitution has failed\n\nAnd then it goes on to explain how it is really a slavery document and the three fifths in the constitution all lies all lies\n\nNow you can argue that or we can begin to teach our children you can argue that\nAnd you can throw it back in their face with some sort of habitat or\n\nName calling of some sort\n\n[noise] here's the question that we all have to answer is America a force for good or a force for bad\nThat requires real thought and discussion\nBecause it is neither in my opinion is both it has been a force for bad and I warn you\nIf we leave the bill of rights we will become the darkest force ever on earth with our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies make no mistake\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people\nWe free to blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWe've brought to free the Germans and all of Europe and the world we fought to free Russia from the tyranny of communism\n\nAnd we failed in the time of peace\n\nFar we good or are we bad is the declaration of independence still a viable mission statement because that's all that is the declaration of independence is a mission statement period\nDo we still hold these truths to be self evident forget about the past let's talk about\nThe future we have never ever\nReached the heights demanded by our mission statement\nBut have we gotten better is it still worth striving for we hold these truths to be self\nEvident that all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance\nDon't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\nYou know you have\nDo you have everything the baby lane next to you has when you were born\nAs far as human rights and dignity\n\nDo you still believe that\nAnd I'm not talking about well it's not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's thrives and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw got into it too I don't care what you put there\nIt just must be bigger than manned\nThe reason why the creator is important is if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print and take away\nRights so if you want to see from\nThe attorneys look great cause most whatever\n\nBut he didn't doubts each of us with certain on changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now there's a lot more\nAnd that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this\nAs an aspirational statement we're only talking about the past\nWe are talking about the mistakes of the past you cannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying\nWhere we're going so where are we going to fall\nWant to terrorists down there now I read your website I read your mission statement I strongly disagree capitalism is not the problem capitalism that is that has no moral sentiment is\nBut you don't fix that by a state run economy by co ops it's always fails\nNo you and your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for\nIt's a failed system\nThis one has been this one has failed us\nBecause it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\n\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do as was\nCow or we have a lot of people uh let me go to a let me go to\nA Scotland in Nevada hello Scotland\n[laughter] hello Glen I'm I just wanted to say that we can be outraged about anything so what we need to do is to turn that negative and positive actions like when President Kennedy challenged America is you get to the moon\nWe need to turn or negative thoughts and chew the positive thoughts\nBut I don't think it's ever been easier do you I mean we're just ignoring all of the positives that are happening to us I mean you knew what a moon shot OK you learn must go into Mars twenty twenty five\nI mean what's bigger than that it's just not a national project do we do we need to wrap it up in national money to be able to get excited about the future\nBecause that's what that was all about the moon shot was all about doing things because we can\nDoing the hard things not the easy things I mean that that was just that was the whole goal and it did galvanized people thanks Scotland you know what people don't think about is Nineteen sixty eight\nIs when we went to the moon same years Woodstock\nMhm wow yeah that's where that's weird yeah so you were either rolling around in the mud or you are reaching for the stars there were two Americas well where is the America that is reaching for the stars where is that America that says no\nNot gonna stop me\nI I I ah I saw post today uh that I that I had to answer a in my Twitter feed let me see if I can find it real quick um\nThat was actually at this is so wrong what is being taught to children into it to everybody um there was a a person Helen plot grows\nAnd apparently fat is my identity and I belong to it whether I'm aware of it or not and even if I'm not this is what I've known for and I'm kidding myself to think people actually think of me primarily as a writer and speaker rather than a fat\nPerson imagine living that way I ...\nI I responded uh uh to that\nAs a growing member of the fat community\nI find the real problem is when I look at myself in the mirror and I define myself by my body I Am more than my body you can define me any way you wish it's your loss what do you say after I Am\nIs much more important than what others say about you so which are we going to be America because the choice is here and the choices so much more than Donald Trump or Kavanaugh heat is so much bigger than this who are we\nAre we the people that role in the mud and are constantly looking down and ... basing ourselves\nOr we the people that look up\nWe the people that look to the future\nAre we the people that say I am getting better every day\nI Am part of a positive community that is going to make a difference to the million man\nJust as well the arguments in a question about federal detention in immigration cases but

it [noise] well\nUh I was I was raised by a far less kinda\nEx hippie uh parents and you know that it was just kind of pushed into me from a from a young age and it was just a it was how I saw everything it was like a filter over the entire world and\nI walked around looking suspicious lead everybody thinking that you know there's something deeply broken within them that they're out to get somebody that they don't understand what I Do or even though I\nI didn't understand very much at all um it was pure emotion and it was wrong and you know informed so what happened and\nWell I'm I one of my close friends um we're having a discussion and he he actually mentioned a Fox News and just kind of said that that's\nThat was his his news source and I was appalled and I was furious and I I went on from that you know just thinking what what I thought I knew this guy when you said all along I had no idea is some kind of monster\nLike how could how could this be and I got curious\nAs to how how this could happen and I went home and I started watching and listening to some people on the other side and it was quite a a slap in the face this was prior to a\nTrump and the whole situation now and all this flame throwing and you know what I saw were\nYou know people who celebrate what we've overcome instead of what we've had to overcome [noise] um\nAnd and it was really powerful and very restore it is uh to me and you know looking at your books you a ... through the lens of addiction are looking at the the way that we approach\nOur politics and the way with regard one another through that lens I I think is so important I've I've gone through addiction myself\nAnd you know as an addict you you learn about about real humility 'em and you find help you find comfort in some of the most unlikely places\nIt really kind of becomes clear to you that you know you can say that diversity is our greatest strength but you know it it's more than that it's it's it's the cooperation

Glenn Beck program\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing well so you know what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really the opposition to the people leading this the leadership that the Democrat Party\nOr or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left is there out a party members they\nWork every day but not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media and they're being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a cold or the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nUh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference in unusual and ... people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right ...\nYou back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violence if you see anti FAA the way to answer and so far is not\nWith uh the militant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets that is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back\nIt works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly as we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country with those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility\nYour kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and said no wait\nDon't don't go that way you're not going to stop the whole crowd but you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony\nWill send you a book uh let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHi Glenn how are you I'm very good [noise] um I\nAgree with every book I think it's awesome and I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess\nOkay you're you're um you're\nTalking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with everything that you've said that we need at least have a conversation about\n... because of it and I\nYou know I think we need to be careful about even\nConsidering heavy I I think that there really is a fear over a I to try to come in ... and ... that's ... yeah it's I think that they want to push ups are socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other technical right on\n... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their thoughts their problem correct and\nSo um I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create the\nMachines and keep running you know there are certain things I just can't like I'm being a ... a leak in your plumbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think many people are going to be upset if they go into the tunnels and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet is known for their service and I know that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you this first of all just and I'd been there's ... ... I don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ... or ... what books are you reading on AI ... or ... or you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if not then they work on this um sound coming up is it different perspectives\nAre having to sit there for a church that I Know that you have sure\nOn that but you know just my feeling like a a I is going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer a quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robots tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so Heather are there there is a very and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see\nOur emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment but no one has to work that\nEveryone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made\nYes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that through a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it was\nI think it's fifty\nPercent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please so you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift\nThat the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today you started your comment about the section of the book where I or there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income\nI Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nRand Paul had an attack at his house\nThey're already moving in that direction [noise]\nTen fifty her we've confirmed that Nikki Haley has resigned as ambassador to the United nations boxes John

seven people and put them in a room all of them from different backgrounds and tried to have a reasonable discussion about\nGuns can you get all different viewpoints into a room the entire spectrum and get them to agree on anything regarding guns he didn't turn out the way we expected uh it it actually\nTaught us something really important that we have that coming up next our uh\nAs we sent ... allowed to do or even beating a let's go to Kelly in Oregon jeeze God Bless you Kelly how are you\nKnow how ...\nHow are you doing her name I'm good but I don't have an to running cities in my state so\nI Know I Know it's a little bit scary here and over again I Want it or\nIt it it is actually um I I live in Springfield which is a little bit more conservative\nThan other places\nBut I wanted to say thank you for your book I'm listening to it I'm On audio so it's it's a lot of fun you did a great job thank you um I I wanted to say thank you for your effort to it and the food section\nI've got a little misleading because I think I talk about food [laughter] well let me let me tell you should let it is where\nWhere do you take it I'm at the McDonalds one and the um the thirty one flavors of Baskin Robbins okay I'm explaining president\nTrump I um had been able to use those references and saying that there are some good things about him to my liberal friends um you don't have to like everything about him but there are some good things that many like McDonalds I mean like the French fries so you don't have\nEverything about McDonald's like the fries right and so I've been able to kind\nOf use that in a joking way and kind of get them to maybe see a little bit of I like him a little bit you don't have to like him personally so anyway I just really enjoyed that\nPart of your book and being able to use a cause I can laugh about it we can laugh about food and\nSo anyway thank you thank you very much stay strong in Oregon or will send you a copy of the book saying to you I'm listening to the point I'm making the book about McDonald's is\nIt's one way you can tell if people are being disingenuous if you have nothing good to say about someone I mean\nNothing everything is

Patel out ah for a for a an assignment if you will\nTo see can we can we get a group of people together all different walks of life I mean the most hardcore progressive to the most hard core conservative and get them in a room and get them talking about\nGuns and school shootings and can we\nTry to get all of them to come to an agreement on anything will they listen to one another can you foster this conversation we learn something that we didn't expect were you surprised by all of this do\nYeah and then it it was a it's a it's an enlightening a journey kind of through there 'cause you could see that\nIt's not as easy as you want it to be a you know we all the all the hesitations that we always talk about it you know dealing with people who disagree with you it's hard sometimes van and like that you know they say things that are so stupid you feel like and they just want to and you wanted to\nVisit I don't I don't want to give away the I don't want to give away the discovery here because it's not what I Would have expected\nAnd in in many ways you understand why it happened mhm you absolutely understand\nOne side will not understand it the other side will understand that um but any fair person looking at the whole thing can go ah\nThey just an amazing science experiment\nIt really is now ... is so so what do we do with this um well we had him put together a group of people and had him the meat and some conference room\nAnd just have a conversation with male female or you know very liberal very progressive very conservative very Christian you know all of them all walks of life and have a conversation about\nSchool shootings we take you through that journey a next with the audio and re as a joined us ...\nThis is truly ... it's truly important and in and you will learn something really I think important yeah I mean\nYou know you usually don't force yourself to be in these situations and that's why it's kind of access science experiment right like I feel like I ... the sort of stuff happens less and less in America where people are just like honestly trying to talk about a an uncomfortable issue that weird thing that we say about like don't talk about religion or politics\nIs like a it's it's understandable and I avoid him all the time at the you know but parties and stuff because I don't want to deal with it but it does hurt the way that we actually um ... our ability to persuade people to our point of view or maybe to learn something that we didn't consider\nWell you know if you were a missionary the last thing you would do is go over to Asia and tell them how stupid Buddha\nIs yeah and that's what we're doing yeah the Westboro Baptist church is they have signs over like Scott hates Buddha is not going to be a ... it's not gonna work and and uh especially the left is using the Westboro Baptist church tactics you are\nBecause it you know politics has become religion for a lot of people we can't do that you will not sway anyone anyone and remember somebody has been swayed who was a family member in the Westboro Baptist church mhm how did it happen\nKindness reason logic\nI miss I miss kindness and that person actually got out and he has wide awake now and sees the evil but she could not see it while the crowd was screaming\nWere not be holding notes on three\nHours and in the pocket so they are a\nAnd we demonize each other even more in the endless gun debate that's almost think guys still fat\nFree learning them there was a much more concerned with moral issues way and arrived\nOn that amount of time and we accept it and we accepted\nFor long we want to add to our\nApproach to debating the says you don't support the second amendment and you support mass killings and certainly there something in the middle\nNight we own want the same exact thing\nTo keep all those French toast eating kids think\nSo this is my question in an increasingly divided America how do we worked together to achieve the same thing\nKeeping our children's safe at school so what's your weeks ago I asked seven very different American to sit down with me and help me find an answer and we do\nWe found an answer but it wasn't at all what I thought it would be the answer as it turns out to my complete surprise he's a single digit number\nThe number that was hastily written on a ... posted belt and passed over to me with a handful of other as part of a kind of warm up exercises the seven were just sitting down to begin our conversation as you hear me read all the numbers down to the group several weeks ago\nThree ten pet or why why\nKeep in mind one of them is our answer forward [noise] let me start by telling you about the seven\nI Am and the high school teacher a mother of three boys three teen boy I Am a fire instructor\nI was a police officer in Arlington police can continue for thirty seven years\nI've wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably considered a constitutional conservative\nI find the older that I get the more progressive and liberal but I become I Am very much on on the side I always vote for the first one that scares me the only\nI even wanted their experiences and feelings about guns to be different\nBy herself yeah shot down in the closet has or not yeah shot down I'm I'm a retired navy combat pilots\nHave guns in our home they're locked out I've never seen them I don't want to see them last me I started shooting I just say my dad and his friend everybody's out in the country\nThese seven words thoughtful well informed good hearted people who all agreed to spend an entire evening talking to people they didn't even know why to come up with a less than that I wanted to find a list even if it was a very short one of specific\nPractical things that we could all agree upon to help combat this intangible threat to our kids that we all think of them from time to time an intangible threat that a ...\nOr teacher in the room explain from the perspective of being inside the schools each and every day\nAnd any time there is any sort of anything out of the norm at school and the kids get weird they get upset and he's just a feeling among the entire school\nThan something dreadfully wrong and I think it all over the country I think ... here and noise in the hallway when you're ISIS quiet and everyone's had turn\nWith that awareness we began talking\nThe story of that conversation has two parts the content of the stuff that was said and then the impact what happened because of what was said so content as we searched for the list for almost four hours\nI'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there was considering remember same children same goal\nImpediment number one opinions outnumber people I Do realize that in this age of unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation\nListened to the following exchange between two mothers and I'm a progressive\nAnd Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspectives that brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear and\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restrictions on myself\nKind of and I'm not going to let you off I think that's kind of a bank that's been in place\nIdeas we can come up with that I'm going to inconvenienced\nBy and you're right there are probably solutions there and your reasonable but that the leaders of your movements are not reasonable that that's why is that when there's a school shooting or mass shooting someplace the first things we hear\nWhen he'd gotten control and the n._r._a. and had\nSo many other opinions and voices most of them extreme jumped right into our conversation ... minutes thirty nine and ...\nHe was heightened from the get go\nDenise or firearms instructor who almost missed a round table because she had food poisoning speaks about the problem with letting other people speak for on\nThe inflammatory temper you know agitator that are being the talking heads on the media is thinking France thinking for me they don't represent ... that kind of craziness\nDoes not represent me and I would like to think that you know when I see these ultra liberal you know screaming about all that stuff and calling people like me again not and all that\nI Would like to think that that's not representative of air so how do we solve that problem with getting the people from stopping the ones that are out there trying to send a message because for me I think it's the wrong one and it's not productive\nI became aware very quickly that it's almost impossible to have a productive conversation with so many other voices reference to repeat it\nHow can I get each person just to speak with them so\nBut it would take a while\n\nSo let me tell you about our sponsor this half hour it's American financing do is use American financing\nAnd um because voter lying and saying uh\nShe uh what who did you get it for ... you get your loan finally from Vito\nIs that you got it from a vetoes cousin vetoes ... not to be named yeah because those who got a little\nLike okay they are what are you give me nothing down a but if you don't pay I take your children there's some children and I do lose my knee caps right but don't pay the American financing I mean this is the kind of people they are they looked at what what he was suggesting and they were like a no no bank will do that and know that well and\nWhen he founded another bank he he called them up they gave him advice and said hey you know worrying about this and this this\nBut in the end they said if you can get that deal and you're comfortable with it go ahead there's right so they're not trying to jam you into something they don't need to sell you a loan and that's what's happening the banks don't give you a loan they're selling it to you\nThese people do not work on commission they do what's right for you go to American financing dot net\nAmerican

only work within the confines of my life and my time but I'm a parent\nHere I have expertise I Want to do something how can we gather the parents and his school to help for to find a bill I think they're probably they're selling a restriction in issues against I mean I don't know I got involved in it or um but\nTwo approaches both felt valid and worthwhile to me but in that moment it felt very ... or\n... little dismissive and this happened to lunch jumping back\nAnd forth between opposing ideas as opposed to spending time discussing integrating them or combining the approaches and I just hope that the divide over the first approach the constant ... de dum de minimize that so much\nThat we aren't able to work together on the second community level approach we need books not only the ruler so those three impediments opinions out numbering people not tearing all the options and either or thinking we're our biggest obstacles and research together for my list\nAnd as we talked what do you wanna get into the they have to be that they're getting health and talk [noise] yeah I got after I got a lot of change here\nWe just kept running up against them\nBut then also you can do well

moment of disconnect that controlled the mood of the ... [noise]\nWe already have laws on that we do not we're not there are only five thousand of them I run again let us all of those going just forget it and then it happened\nThe moment I had been fearing\nWe reached it\nNow are you willing to put the cameras no\nDoubt\nBecause you're not even willing to let them know regime\nSoon after an of summed up how a lot of us were feeling\nComing in hair I\nI thought our chances of getting at all is said gather with with I was more optimistic and I said why would we are where we are today and it's that that sort of an hour and ...\nThe conversation ended shortly after we all said goodbye then I sat in the room alone in texted my husband to work [noise] is that [noise]\nI could not\nGet the enemy in line to go away in that room even for a little while [noise] but I was wrong there's content\nAnd then there's the Batman\nAnd fifty\nFox News on Chris foster Nikki Haley is resigning as ambassador to the United nations at the end of the year President Trump says he's done an incredible job but that she's ready for a break she thanked the president and says\nIt has been an honor in her lifetime I you know I said\nLeads to stay that way and to serve\nOur country I have very she was\nGovernor of South Carolina for six years before this she says she's not sure what she'll do next but that does not include running for president against President Trump and twenty twenty he says he'll nominate a new UN ambassador the next two or three weeks at the Supreme Court [laughter]\nThe protesters were there as new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh arrived here\nHis first cases this morning they were the federal sentencing guidelines and what constitutes\nA violent offender this is Fox News [noise]\nWell see Asian [noise]\nMm [noise]\nHow surprised were you that\nThis fell apart\nBecause to me that's where they all it right there yes I was not just shocked but personally got it because I found all these people and with the best intentions I said look out there in the world no one's talking let's try and create this environment with the seven of us that we can\nGo past that we'll we'll know each other you're all good people and I could not believe that with all that parental them coming in that the the guards went up and see because you're not granted it's not the seven people it's\nAll of the voices that are in each of their heads that they're all battling I understand why he said what he didn't cut her off and it has nothing to do with the people in that room exactly the people in that room\nCould compromise could potentially hypothetically yes yes and so if I if that was their community and it was only about them they could come up with it\nThe next day I ... I ... couldn't get out of bed and when I looked at my phone there was this flurry of text and email from other people in the room saying how deeply miss we all tried we missed so what did you find out\nWell what was interesting with one of the text was an invitation from Denise our firearms instructor to to Anna are progressive activists mother saying you want to continue the conversation why don't you come down to the shooting range and we can and and so I can beat this and Anna accepted in a second I'm shocked\nAnd so the next day this progressive activists went to the shooting range\nThe base of the n._r._a. building to continue the conversation with the firearms trainer and that's where we go now\nPersonally take out an air campaign to\nA twenty two semi automatic hang on a very\nOkay they someone nervously wash them engage each other woman won the memory of their interaction from not even forty eight hours prior ... still pretty much [noise]\nAfter a heart I got to get out of the house\nThey began this new conversation with basic [laughter]\nSo how do you take the safety off because they keep the safety on and then if it had it ... it depends on the specific type of\nFire says this one [noise]\nAnd then they started talking more specifics to be honest it Denise explaining some of the existing gun laws that don't make sense\nSo if someone were to hold this like this\nOur shoulder and we are now shooting at like\nOf the law and you're technically a\nFelon why would there be an issue if you're holding it as a rifle why why why would it be considered illegal because now\nIf he's chosen not registered as a rifle you didn't ... fetch he purchased it as a pistol and now you're shooting at as a rifle are saying\nYou're in violation of the law\nComplete makes absolutely no sanctions\nAnd then this happened and they were talking about bullets\n... much larger bullet tons more powder that says ... so that's a typical hunting around they can just see that the different than the power and penetration between the bullets and the amount of powder that goes and then\nThe ...
