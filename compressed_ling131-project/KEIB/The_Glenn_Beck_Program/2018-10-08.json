who was identified as attending University of Washington student denied having sexually assaulted his accuser quote I was investigated by my school's office and found that there was insufficient

like we all there's a lot of people who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's\nSome evidence that they do um you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true and a lot of case um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this is you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they down and all this is like a\nLot as a leader in in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I

how do we persuade people to look at the world and they're slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talk about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles

designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do is it's the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nYou know a search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know as you get into deep stuff but I don't even know how just why myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know when you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor ... search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principles\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using it and I want to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on grown so now I've got ...
