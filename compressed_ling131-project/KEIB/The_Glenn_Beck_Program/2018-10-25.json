bombs ill when the news first broke out it just didn't pass melt that for me\nReason being\nThe news reported that want to store employees opened the package and noticed it was a bomb and the quickly and swiftly took the packets to a remote location on the property all the ... where the bomb fought detonated\nThe package when their right mind would say here's a bomb now let me ... ... was opposed to um I don't know evacuating building and then calling authorities so that'd be real interested if somebody requests the bomb threats grew up with that and I'm On a lot of yeah\nThe phone I'm Sorry I was processing what you were saying the phone transcripts of which nine one one call\nWhen the story of employee called the authorities regarding the first package bomb because\nThe authorities or after the news broke out that the employee open the package and noticed that it was suspicious then a bomb and then took it to a remote location onto the property\nThe employee transported to bond to a remote location and they called the ... who would notice a bomb and said let me go ahead and pick up this live active bomb and bring it into the woods\nSo you don't buy that this happened organically\nNot at all ... nobody's in it you know nobody's going to grab a landmine and say let me go bring us into the forest away from our troops who in their right mind would grab a bomb and then continue to handle it and bring it into a remote location of a property\n[noise] knock it out and do you watch Ozark I doubt\nWell I Will tell you that sometimes people just accidentally go walking

says get her\nDone except none of your bombs get it done none\nThey have they've had zero chance of making it through security screening and Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go this dam road runner keeps going getting away maybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and\nDo you think George Soros does\nEvery person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening\nThese devices were not designed to kill\nBut to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms no one knows yet this could be a kid they just thought\nThis would be funny again there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste\nBy noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report\nThat could I ask when the president has actually called for violence\nNow you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on but we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nOver or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one to deny that\nLatest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters\nJust sent to the White House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happen to forget\nAll about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old\nWere you in twenty Seventeen he barely remember was I walking at the time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote for those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on any saying everything is speculation\nAnd if I Would say Ari versus a left wing person trying to Iran for everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose the people listening and they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right\nSo why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility to be able to gain it\nOver twenty ... well\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us that he is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous is this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of ... when I when we first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really I mean it's a plot you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel was what's dangerous and a pipe bomb and explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal\nOkay we don't need [laughter] [laughter] right\nUm but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it um that they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again everything is spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or\nSomebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't\nWant it to work\nRight it had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is you know and I've also spent some time and some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to they have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN on media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no\nWell I was no chance just gets to the coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication level is supposed to get him because he had sent or she by the way\nHe or she had\nA had sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices and and residences\nWhere there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would have definitely\nBe school until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers with a

the headline on CNN Trump a Trump I'm a mocks media as explosives investigated well\nWait ... you guys were blaming Trump and mocking Trump yesterday before all of the bombs were even found you were blaming it on him\nWithout CNN is it's really irresponsible he has gone over LA edge they worked a target of this and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running a news organization ... he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there are words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that\nAnd it's I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence no evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fed into these bombings we have no idea we have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a political\nMotive but that's a ... a political motive but that's all you could say you don't know\nIt is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off yeah the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope God I'm Glad none of them went off by the way\nUm but it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we've just talked about a no leads to that and and your and your and your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and da da da da na at\nAn exact science or you can't say often to point to our right at that time on timing to you could've blown up the post and yeah so that there was a photo timer it when it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was was kind of funny is the wires

up on my a leftist anarchists cookbook a that was put out\nA by the left and the Nineteen sixties and seventies about pipe bombs and you know it's really interesting is um uh it does show how to make one you know with the clock or but it also shows how to make them\nYou know so they go off like let's say you open an envelope mhm you would pull a string and that era in that area which would make the bomb go off [noise] I'm I'm trying to figure out welcome to the program pat gray from pat gray unleashed\nUm I'm trying to figure out what was the timer timing to\nEither this is the worst bomber of all time in human history or there's something else going on here\nBecause you why would you put up a sticker on a bomb like I ... I\nGuess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I guess in theoretically possible but if you know of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and ... and less and less again\nPotentially a you've thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right wing meat yeah right like\nAlmost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nBy all put they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you want metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't but glass in the bomb would just\nDisintegrate the glass even more ... you you don't want it in PVC pipe you wanted in a metal pipe because of the shrapnel\nThis is just it's there's just\nToo many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... ... to end the stupid or it might be some kid that thought this would be funny it might be some you know mentally deficient\nA right winger that did it it also may be somebody who was on the left as like oh I Know how to change the narrative\nCould be that two of quaint don't know I mean you have to have some\nLevel of skepticism of the south of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you lead to that is it's not they haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you to be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing or figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think it's someone who was opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be rights and and just white powder\nWide and someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievably\nWhen someone just to listen to this I suppose he thinks the communist didn't set fire to the rice dogs as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's\nNo reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point what you see these statements that have come out from CNN and ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe right and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how well no but I think a virus that might have been [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's obvious incentive to make America that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\n... what's that what what's the match up\nA Green Bay and whoever they are playing I forget that every week now because you're just going to be very big literally you on Monday Mornings bring the recap the best of moron tribute to this program [noise] Hi Willa yeah we'll look into that yeah oh my gosh look at that and do we want to work to do all the work and let you reap the benefits\nYeah yeah yeah [laughter]\nFor a trivia is tomorrow with ... at least thanks pat ah alright [noise]\nMy patriots supply\nWould like to ask you this question do you have jumper cables\nNo of course yeah why do you have jumper cables are such a\nConspiracy theorist you're such a worry wart you were such a small sometimes you're free you might leave your light honor yo ... your battery dies over their car could start a okay All right so\nYou got to be a proper and have your you have your job ... prepping that's just being smart\nOh this is this is honestly this is the argument\nPeople ... you feel weird 'cause you're preparing you you know for something that could or couldn't happen I Can't remember the last time I had a jump my engine but I've had to help others jumped there's\nIt's just a good idea\nTo be able to have jumper cables isn't it just being prepared this is why you buy emergency food when a crisis strikes you're ready to feed yourself and your family or help out others might patriots supply food storage that I have and you should have as well like two weeks food cat\nWill get you started now two weeks sets breakfast lunch and dinner for two solid

jumper cables\nEverybody should have the eight hundred two hundred and Seventy one sixty three eight hundred two hundred Seventy one sixty three or prepare with Glenn dot com [noise]\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now\nNot into relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain\nQuite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need\nTo lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more\nLet's see if we can get you out of pain to go to relieve factor\nDot com [noise]\n\nAll right so the White House ah\nAs a reported that uh we now have another bomb that was found in that was to a Mike Pence vice president Pence and\nThe second to package or to vice president Joe Biden was ah found this morning at a Delaware postal facility\nBut you know another reason why I guess you put a timer on those things that I mean it's just it's so this is so bizarre again none of them have gone off they they intentionally exploded I think this or it was one um to make sure that you know they ... the police did it\nUm but ah listen to this this is again we're supposed to be there's a high level of sophistication of these bombings ...\nSomeone actually said that the biggest mass uh assassination attempt a we've seen in some time yeah about\nA year because you just had it and they actually like almost killed someone in Congress on a baseball field they just completely forget about this moment\nBut listen to this this is these are the labels Debbie Wasserman Schultz S. H. U. L. T. Z. incorrectly spelled Florida F. L. O. R. I. D. S. it's Niceville, Florida rent and B. R. E. N. A. N. two ends ... or ... ... to order it should be one word or and left out to\nThe word street on whole holders will solve a Fox ... and it shows the level of sophistication\nOr or not or not\nThis guy who just based on the spelling\nPossibly foreigner or more wrong\nYeah very well could be more on just seeing how he built a bomb yeah I'm leaning towards more on\nYeah I like I don't know\nRight that's the important thing but it's going to be so many people speculating about this I just think you can't jump to conclusions there's going to be a massive investigation over this I don't know why this is so much of a bigger story than you know rice and being sent to right wing figures a week or two ago\nI got a gas or whatever it's honestly this is going to last longer and be bigger than what happened on the baseball diamond over a year yeah yeah well and that one was semi successful\nI mean the guy was firing shots almost killed some ...\nFor more than three years of software vulnerability and the Google Plus social media network unwittingly gave a third party developers potential access to users private profile information now if you're using the Google Plus social

and over again criminals can open accounts file tax returns by\nProperty or from some data exposure that's tiny and there's so many threats and today's connected world takes just one weak link for criminals to get it\nYou know bad to anybody's pain do you think she did\nDo you think Megan Kelly was sitting there going oh man\nThat's you know what you know what I'm today show I Am going to bring up that lady Diana Ross and I'm just going to cause people pain she says thanks for listening and helping me listen to no\nNo I didn't hear it I don't know what was said to you off air there's a lot of people in the audience that probably said yeah I mean they don't mean offense\nHow is this how is this a problem how is this a problem\nWell if we don't know we just know shut up apologies aren't good enough anymore they're not good enough it doesn't matter\nWhere in the throes of cultural lawlessness executions on demand contacts commonsense doesn't matter execute them hang them getting rid of them\nI guess what's happening next she dropped by ca I think she was dropped by her talent agency she's a pariah now she's a pariah and people will say on the right good\nReally good good people on the left will say good\nMegan Kelly affected anyone's life\nWell she has made it very difficult for NBC to live\nDown their sexual harassment and assault that's been going around their offices\nShe keeps bringing that up\nShe was very serious and one of the biggest critics of NBC and the way they handled\nSome of those allegations seemingly they are really finding a a quick way\nOr they seem to be to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those are things that she said\nWhich is kind of fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know that they're going to tell us talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and that and how how those conservatives are really that Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy\nOr but we're going to find when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all that goes on\nAnd making Kelly happened to me one of the biggest critics of what happened at NBC\nAnd yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone that's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can damned those remarks\nThere is no place on our air or in this work place for those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I added that quote it's very unfortunate and quote\nWhat is unfortunate is that America has devolved into a country of oversensitive cry babies who take offense at the slightest thing\nAnd you know what I don't even think it's America I don't think it's Americans I really don't I don't think that it's a vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country that are cry babies they're sick of this\n\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics\nAnd the last place probably the last comes first academia [laughter]\nYou should be coddled the slightest thing upset you well that's not American\nIt's not where are the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains\nIn in a um a in a ... a wagon\nTrain okay is she was she looks like me in a dress with a bomb it okay she she ... she also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\nYou know she did she wiped her face and ... and kept going she didn't wind gene cry about it she's like oh\nCrap [noise] shouldn't around with that I poked my eye out and she moved on\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happened we move on that yes people say things that I don't like we move on that yes\nThings have changed we're involving we're learning\nNew things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's\nNot throw that away\n\nMegan Kelly ought to know blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what if it's a\nCostume that his purpose flea ridden a ridiculing race as black face has done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly\n... is being fired not because she wore black face\nBut because of words and I the ah question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people\nWhy is this wrong\nThat person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume\nWhy is this wrong\n\nI think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me how\nAre we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nLook criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nThis is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't sort of there's something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe said to

true\nWe may say as a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation is not

president Joe Biden have been intercepted that was originally thought to be just one one of those was found at a male facility in Newcastle Delaware the other in Wilmington in addition another one was found this morning at the Tribeca Film production office in lower Manhattan address to actor Robert De Niro\nAt the time but he's not really funny enough to be a standup comedian as we as a side has basically stand up comedy show a Michael Moore and Trump land which cannot twenty sixteen right during the weeks before the election is hoping sway the electric to Hillary\nWhen you when you say that when you say like we saw um I don't think you're yet you should be careful with the use of the week because I don't think I don't think I could find two people maybe you and I don't know who else in his audience might have seen the act\nI think they're dressed like a million bucks I mean it has always most slapped in the past few years they've got worse and worse sick of did okay but\nTwelve years ago as movie about a health insurance and what she claimed as a Cuban healthcare system was better than us health care so it's a it is sort of insane rats and no longer that rare you can find them everywhere and basically I I think they use audience that used to go to movies I'm never or Columbine and get a lot of\nYoung people in their twenties or real excited about that movie\nUh they've forgotten about it maybe they moved on to children came along to their Daily Show and all these other alternative forms of comedy and uh you know Michael Moore is is when you're not really funny enough to be a comic\nAnd okay so so you are you saying that it's just that he's not funny or that a is there anything to be said\nFor uh the fact that uh this this kind of stuff uh\nYou know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not he's not the rebel anymore\nIt's not and that's just not you know he was revolutionary and we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy Pelosi saying all the same stuff that he was saying\nRight there is no scarcity value to what he does anymore everyone's doing it uh there's a kind of pathetic moment at the end of star nine eleven nine where he does it say we're montage and trying to say Trump is like Hitler and it's like if you're into playing the speech the Trump and Hillary and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler\nOn the left for about three years is like is the last one to this Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of ... where the culture has gone because we have it at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even in and we talked about with Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that policy and they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where\nWe look at Canada and say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left\nPointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism I mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know we're socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an end to capitalism and they're still getting elected\n\nReading Michael Moore has been a been a leader of that parade for a while but now he's kind of ... in back of that is it's got uh\nIt's kind of got ahead because this movie um capitalism a love story with uh the communist uh at them you see the Soviet Nashville has some ... and that kind of thing is it's not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does that say as I say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think a Democratic Party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at the time was seems like\nGehring we saw last but that's that's about as far left as they really should care to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should stay out of this open borders stuff they should stay away from a abolish\nIce they should stay away from Medicare for all all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls and the Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest position since the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that is well it's it's amazing that it is this strong uh and that's only because I think of the Democrats moving so far left\nI agree ... thank you so much Kyle Smith a critic at large for National Review\nSo [noise]\nI'm listening to President Trump got another one of these [noise]\nAh you know rallies and he's talking\nAnd I'm\n... and and I'm I'm hearing the reporter this morning talk about it and how out of touch he is and I thought to myself you know\nOne of us is deeply deeply mistaken because he was saying you know this is this is this election is about Cabot off this election is about the caravan this election is about um uh shutting people up\nThis election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that's what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog whistles except for if if you\nThink that the caravan is not something you should worry about what's wrong with you if you're not worried about the economy and the effects of the budget and tax cuts uh\nWhat's wrong with you you just don't see it or are you\nIs your philosophy sill upside down from traditional American uh economics and philosophies\nThat we are now on the other side of the fence promote move from one another and I I think when it comes to the\nPoliticians that is what it is they are on the other side of the fence and they just don't think this way anymore now Donald Trump has said if we lose the
