just like any\nIf you are in the greater Houston area and you're driving around open to the public tonight starting at seven o'clock so had oh we're [noise] we're having a debate watch party\nProbably watch some Astros as well but we're going to watch a Ted Cruz shred Beto O'Rourke\nKitchen will be open view would like to a man come and have a beer\nWith some are like minded\nFellow Americans that's at West airport and fifty nine written a country club\nWe'd love to have [noise] see if I still have [noise]\nThe arcade games cc ... greatest songs All right\nAnd your tune we're number two bad moon rising\nAnd number one have you ever seen the rain [noise]\nVotes called in with [noise] midnight special fortunate sons some day never comes more on the ... they came out of the sky\nProud Mary [noise] as long as I can see the light a lot of calls\nFor that particular show [noise] I feel like I'm CC are kind of writing the sweet spot\nOf our um [noise]\nYou know we were told there was a blue wave coming [noise]\nIt's almost as if the Democrats and their friends in the media were predicting it in hopes that they could will it to happen\nBut when you get closer and closer to election time what you find is\nThat the people who operate the major media outlets live on the coasts and every body they know\nEverybody they know hates Trump and wants him out once in a beach these echo chambers can be very very negative for giving perspective\nAnd that's what you saw when on election night\nYou saw the tears streaming down people were shocked the left was shocked how\nCould it be that Hillary lost every body they knew loved Hillary how good it how could it be that if everybody loved Hillary she\nDidn't win the election because everybody I Know loves Hillary except that's exactly right you're out of touch 'cause you're on the coast well\nThat's what happened with the blue wave that I think is going to end up having petered out and I give you a good example you take this Christensen name in Arizona\nShe was neck and neck with Martha McSally and then things started coming out that ...\nShe doesn't actually liked the state of Arizona she doesn't like the people in Arizona remember this one that came out\nBad faith than necessary huh I pay ... a laboratory that democracy and then my hair is on it and that flash [laughter]\n\n\nI have had that line someone and they have read it but I'm happy I feel that any us how to\nUse it all the time that's what you referred to your ... you want to represent these people in Washington DC you want to be the face of Arizona and you think it's the meth lab of democracy well this one has emerged now\nDo they know what's happening in Arizona and not a good way hey we're not going to get anywhere in the low here in the same as a man\nAnd that's how she refers to the people in the states she wanted to represent and guess what it made her unpopular I Wish the\nDemocrats would do what they do after they lose a wish they would do that before the election of course they won't they don't want people to know what they really thing\nBut if they did boy oh boy would it be powerful you know Hillary Clinton after she lost\nShe went on a tour to she's ... always need more money markets they must chew through a lot of money and after after she lost she went out and she talked about white women\nIn how stupid white women are and they just do what their husbands tell them\nSee if I have that Ramon did you did you text me or email me that report this morning on on white women voting alright let me see if I can pull that up\nBecause we're back to where we were in two thousand here we go\nWhere the soccer mom was the or the white suburban woman was going to determine that election Twenty one days for the midterms white women in past midterms in two thousand six they made up forty percent of the voters\nAnd they went fifty to forty non for Republicans\nIn two thousand ten they made up forty percent of the electorate and they went fifty eight thirty nine for Republicans and in two thousand four team they made up thirty eight percent of the electorate but they went fifty six forty two for Republicans\nSo do you see why Democrats are trying so hard to make white male Republicans look like rapists because they need white women voters and I don't think they're going to get them\nHope to see you tonight at our a\nDebate watch party have a beer [noise]\n\nThe ... said crews and good luck to our Houston Astros [noise]\nGrisly details of murder in France I'm Dave Anthony Fox News or Turkish newspaper has published what his purported to be the torture and killing of journalist your markers show he in the Saudi conflict on the east and bowl using getting themselves from an alleged audio recording of secretary of state Pompeo's in Turkey for talks are going to Saudi Arabia\nThey ... I hadn't seen the ... program\nSo we have Bill O'Reilly coming up in about an hour I'm going to be gone for the next couple of days and and the bill is going to come in and give us a rundown of the week so far and we have a lot to discuss one of them is Saudi Arabia this story is just getting more and more bizarre\nLet me bring you up to speed in case you don't know\nThe story started a couple of weeks ago with this idea that this Washington Post reporter is suddenly missing well\nHe's not a Washington Post ... a reporter only\nHis name is ... and uh he is a Saudi Arabian citizen he is also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood his beef with Saudi Arabia in his own what he called self imposed exile is all about\nThe Saudis not befriending and not\nUm uh not excusing the behavior of the Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis are very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization and not a friend to Saudi Arabia or really any one in the world\nSo he went into self imposed exile a and he came here to the United states\nThe there are claims that he is he he was still a Muslim Brotherhood operative there are also claims that he was feeding us information\nUh uh uh uh against the Muslim Brotherhood I'm not sure which to believe at this point\nSo he's overseas he's in Turkey and he is going to get\nMarried but he's been divorced to his wife in Saudi Arabia for him to be able to get remarried he has to have a a divorced certificate from Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabia and say well you're going to have to come into the embassy to get it now he is not a friend to the Saudi Arabian prince\nThe one who has been this big reformer and he is going to you know take Saudi Arabia into the future and he is good for women and he is good for human rights and everything else\nIs shaggy is not popular with that prince and that prince has not been popular with ... the he had been trying to get Chicago as a shaggy to come back to Saudi Arabia but ... I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get\nThe paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though she was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\n... but it's kind of hard to believe\n[noise] the new information today you know is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly or last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead\nUm but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation and torture and killing\n\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it's finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true\nFor her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if it's if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this\nMay be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia we're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of more machinery to Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is quietly supportive of of ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nIf this tape exists and this tape comes out we\nHave all known that Saudi Arabia is a bad place but we have not heard the screams\nIf this tape exists and comes out\nPeople of the world will for ever think of Saudi Arabia and put them in the same class as stolen as Hitler as Mabhouh or as Kim Jong who in\nA in in uh\nNorth Korea but we remember North Korea's crimes we only have sketches of if this tape exists and comes out it's a game changer that could destabilize everything will go back into the\nStory in a second first let me tell you our sponsor is one eight hour what eight

I mean getting remember this prince took his own you know family members other princes hostage in a hotel and is likely stole tons of their wealth\nIncluding plane and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking the remains out in suitcases\nSo these are the planes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know in a you know rich Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia it's a lot worse than it's happening you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we didn't with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kind of ... around in time to everybody down\nAnd then when everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you ... your duct tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're knocked friends of ours they are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it\nWe don't need it open up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nWe'll watch this closely a it's a ticking time bomb back in the sex\nFifty [noise]\nFox News I'm Chris foster the first lady Melania Trump's okay the plane she was on had to turn back to a joint base Andrews ten minutes into a flight to Philadelphia reporter on board said there was a haze of smoke and the burning smell it got stronger crew members as it came from an overheated communications you'd have pathetic that hasn't been confirmed from the White House yet they're getting a new plane ready for the trip\nThe secretary of state Mike Pompeo has met with leaders in Turkey about the disappearance of a Saudi Arabian journalists there the\nTurkish foreign minister saying he and Mike ... beneficial and fruitful talks ... who's also met with the ... president they ... as a nice patron techie publishes what it says how details from an old guy recording allegedly capturing Jamal ... being tortured killed ... men but\nInside to consider Saudi Arabia has described allegations along those lines as baseless socks\nIs Simon ... coming out the best day since March stocks are down to start the day on Wall street is it Fox News [noise]\nSomething you're not one hundred percent clear on yourself and learn more visit your facts dot com that's Jay you you out facts dot com rocky you buy ... if you don't smoke or vein don't start wanting those products containing women team will give you a little bit of chemical\nThis is Clark Howard if you were one time had MoviePass I have a special warning for you it is very important that you check the credit card statement of whatever credit card you were building MoviePass too if you were using a debit card hoops\nCheck your checking account statement because MoviePass changed its terms and conditions calm\n\nGlenn than probably ...

you and it's going to be a lot of fun it's going to be happening right around election time\nAnd we have some uh twenty twenty um you know elections suggestions I'm just I'm just because I'm a helper I'm a helper Stu your helper and we just want to help the Democratic socialist out\nAh we've got some extra spending maybe that they could consider some slogans necessarily think extra spending as possible or what their support them having a job that I don't think they've taken every dime true yeah I mean\nDifficult to find more to spend ... ways to spend them first there's millions member the classic documentary or from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance even received the full inherent it's a three hundred um this is an important moment uh in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take any assets so he couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right he had to zero at this at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing where you do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from that on was the idea and then in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually this is a spoiler alert from Nineteen eighty three but how did he or wind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at ... uh so I think ah you know\nThis is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is can they figure out another way to spend\nMoney we may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a a democratic socialist [laughter] and do you have to spend\nSixty trillion dollars\nDo it harder than you think it is harder than ... can you do it\n... the socialist already have but can you do it\nVery difficult right is very different do you have to go over that things were going back dot com slash tours place to go by the way to get to grab your tickets\nBill O'Reilly is coming up in just a few minutes and we have a lot to ah to talk to him about um I I\nI don't know if you've seen this but uh Minnesota's democratic former ah or sorry farmer labor party ah this ah this this weekend to this last weekend said Republicans should be brought to the\nGuillotine on November So\nThat's a that's okay that's that's a that's not as bad as saying you want a targeted districts to take her [laughter] right right yeah yeah\nThe guillotine is I mean you know that's common language people always say that ah bringing a gay a teen we get ... but those you know whoever into a gear team\nNow I assume mhm I hate to say this but I assume they're not actually building get changed but Republicans and I'm not sure I'm not a hundred I'm not sure it's any more I think I Do think ... you know could be talked into it pretty quick all yeah and if I\nProbably could be a Roger Williams or the congressman pointed this out in an op ed he wrote for the Dallas Morning news talking about how he was a I don't know on a baseball field being shot at 'em and kind of remembers that and and it's maybe not so a positive on this new\nDemocratic um a way of thinking where they're saying ... uh Eric Holder when Republicans go low we kick them\nI'm Cory Booker says get up in the face of congresspeople Maxine Waters harassed members of the Trump Administration Hillary Clinton we cannot be civil or all of these things are ... are are maybe a little bit more impactful to someone who was being shot at by a Bernie Sanders volunteer on a baseball field in Washington DC police almost\nBe killed but what's worse but what's worth those things the guillotine or horse face seriously what's worse wow that's a great I mean one of those things deserves\n[noise] was I going to happen I mean [noise] it's a bigger picture first of all back I'm addicted to outrage like you are\n... just addicted to\nOut a ... and I know\nThe bigger picture here is this\nUm the Democratic party is confused now they don't know what to do All right I'm Juanita Broderick claim that Bill Clinton tried to rape depression never in a million years is going to give that allegation\nAny exposure at all not it's not going to happen so you can talk about it I can talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay but it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nOr ... why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality is that is putting herself out there in these positions where she is the re litigate this stuff\nNow the reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant so she can run again for president\n[laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you\nYou know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am telling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo you know I Know she wants to run and do you really think she will\nIt depends depends a lot on Biden it depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against her is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is the Democratic party doesn't know what to do\nWith Bill and Hillary Clinton\nThey don't know what to do with them All right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on the road and they were in and talk to their devoted supporters this isn't an accident [noise]\nThis is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a great a first lady as she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretaries that that's what this is it ... it up across the country to see\nHow it's going to fly\nBut if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that a non\nAmerican Idol [laughter] know rushed her yeah horrible\nCrushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we got a little bit of bad blood on an average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves came as a knock it off where she's not Cherokee um this is a total of ... and fraud and knock it off\nThe chair in themselves crazy\nOK and war and you used that ruse as I say in my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] used the rose to advance their current and academia so\nAnd this is a woman who thinks she's going to win an election she's not only in Massachusetts that maybe in Oregon you know these states that she could get into the Senate but as a national viable candidate in a way\n... as in the ... the number one political strategist a do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I she ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three [laughter]\nAnd she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um she was a turkey\nIs just or as a mother or\nYou know was a source of all of this but look I'm getting back to to Beck's a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is obsessed\nOh yeah\nAll right so she didn't\nFit into the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't rough Akeley she lets them\nYeah she's a system a Paul would they call in New York She's a tall so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes or I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what\nThey may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than ... is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg is going to run for president of the Democratic ticket\nAnd you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg is very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm ... and older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think in twenty twenty but I think twenty twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has at the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock\nAnd it's the it's the reverse you know ...\nThey're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPer year does he you know I'm not sure you need the uh the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I were to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\nDrought smash that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this is in her time the next time around I just want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about ... ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland more with Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com and don't forget his new book is out killing\nThe ss which is fantastic uh pick it up and grab my book at the same time by him as a set I guess I think that's what Amazon is recommending people who bought this brought this to a so grab 'em 'cause they're both really good alright liberty safe liberty saved the number\nThat they would go out in the rose city which signs condemning the mayor and antifa and mass tens of thousands of them\nThey gather by that while I'm at river with their size this is not the city we want you got anybody out there doing that nobody so this is the problem the problem is that when you lower the problem is that in ... the problem is the people in Portland, Oregon\nAnd that's why I wrote killing the ss 'cause I'm saying we better wake up here in America we better wake up and confront evil antifa is evil\nSo I get my soul mate\nSee I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose\nThat there isn't a an uprising or in Portland or they are the\nBlind to it for some reason or do they actually supported are they afraid to come out what is the what's the only real readership\nIn ... in in Montgomery County so you\nIf I were

... but\nI don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe there are a lot like me and maybe people hit me or I'm not going to do it\nIt's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want dogs on the streets in mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten a grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got

over the weekend and said\nIt's time to bring the gear teams out for the Republicans I'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets\nYou um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] well I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we'd go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper or with five hundred signatures are attached to it so the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have\nUm some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ... possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ss is really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage\nAnd um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive the most and arts elements in our society the pressure sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes\nSo ... that's a big difference we didn't have that what was that a left wing press but we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um uh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties those some of them we don't have as we

I think actually we should start a team of some sort and we should come up with a Native American name ourselves really yeah yeah I'm a you know people seem to be going the other way that they're all yeah\nI Do think it's about time that we go the other way [laughter] I think it's about ... I had enough\nOf it so you know\nYou have a if you have a name a for something you know that we started baseball team or you know something you don't just inside the blaze with that'd be cool you can send us the ah the team name and the mascot and we'll get together and have a powwow without it and see what we can do\nFor four years here at the blaze ah people around the offices have been using relief factor and it's made a huge change for a lot of people uh Glenn it's been very transparent about suffering with pain as you may have heard for the last few years and most of it as my\nBackside caused by stew [laughter] I don't know what that means exactly but I don't want to delve into it at a ... a backup my neck how's that there you go painted by a pain in your neck you asked me a really factor do really made a big difference in Glen and and the way he was able to actually manages wife yeah I've I really feel like I have a new lease\nBecause as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water are becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall I'm In ... was absolutely health of these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHoward hounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground\nYou know and it it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens\nAnd things like that ... and the reason for that is because they they have no choice but to fight and die they can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me they're white guys read ... and they can't they can't get away so\nThose guys had to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to are saying I I've got to do\nI got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as Rene fun yes in Burma yes in last we talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update for us\nYes absolutely so ah also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as her infant\nWorking yeah they are you are telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all\nTogether slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have the ... okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's a really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes are done several trips with the ... and find in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to how this because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with a ranger\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so\nWhy why are they doing this why are they doing this these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lines they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject or surf class you have to basically serve the Berman and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're the spirit lord as there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought I brought with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over his mercy just pass their apologize I think okay so I brought with me [noise] several photos\nOf\nOf what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise] [noise]\n[noise] and these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened um this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos\nYou see dead civilians you see kids dead\nA baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby and that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and the baby didn't die right away I'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and the ... still wants to attack them and take more from them and\nSo every time I go there every time the ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the army him in his family have fled the army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that the ... was there and he came and found me and said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... leaves and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark\nIt's bark from a tree and he's like this is all we have to snack on while my wife prepares food\nAnd he gave me tree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and she has nothing is literally nothing and she wanted to give me ... because that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark but this man and\nI I was I was so overcome was just like I ... his gratitude\nAt the level of gratitude to show for us for that for the mouser infant being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle\nAnother man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he turned ... as he's driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh like oh good English or what I'm trying to come and talk more about um um I'm about what what it used more English and so I was like oh like what\nOr him here it is yeah I Know 'cause you know there's so much he's up by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven\nAnd St Paul were avid is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll is it the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you think of this bright red country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve\nThat gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas at it this way try this on for size\nA a Donald\nTrump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talk about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life Ted Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "17"}
