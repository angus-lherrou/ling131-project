{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "\nMan man so this\nAfternoon is my grandmother's funeral was not prepared to say anything [noise] um [noise]\nOn friday I guess it was the morning after she passed and I wasn't sure if I Would say something today or\nTomorrow because I'm not very good with those things and I start bowling [noise] um but I Will just say this um there is in every person something that we can take from their life um\nTheir greatest assets that I think all of us can be better from and I'm\nRuth berry who I referred to as grandma bury 'em my dad's mother had many many of those traits in fact I'm much like my father\nProbably the most St like human being I've ever met in my life I Know everybody's grandmother is special to them\nUh I Know everybody's grandmother has something that you remember fondly but actually I don't remember of grandma bury her famous dishes or or things like that what I remember most about her was a person of fierce independence\nAnd strength and dignity she was widowed um\nShe was widowed when my grandfather died in a car wreck coming back from Louisiana and\nI think it was a lot harder back then there were fewer programs that were fewer things to lean upon so she went to work as a cafeteria workers in the west orange start school district where she probably started\nThere in her mid ... maybe even her late thirties\n[noise] it's hard for a woman who's not been in the workforce to enter the workforce\nWithout any degrees without any experience without a resume without any\nReferences I'm so she became a lunch lady cafeteria lady and she was everything that you would want in the cafeteria lady\nShe Puerto heart and soul in that she took great pride in it [noise] um and she ended up getting a full retirement from there I Am and I bet she worked\nA bet she she worked thirty five years as a cafeteria worker and she started later the most but somewhere along the way she never remarried somewhere along the way she picked up an evening job as well she went to work at hallmark\nShe worked there were two hallmarks but it's still ...\nYou don't see 'em any more but she worked at the hallmark an orange and then she worked at the hallmark in a rut city and I will tell you that I don't think\nI'm certain that there was never a graduation birthday unit everybody in our ... you knew that everybody else might forget to get you a card but to grandma Barry\nCards were very important and there was never an occasion when that was missed and even when my boys came along it was just like clockwork inch shoot she was in her nineties by them it's not easy to go get a card when you're in your nineties\nBut what I admire about her was her\nAbsolute strength here was a woman who had raised her children the youngest were I think probably finishing high school when my dad was second to the oldest um there was awkward Jean the my dad Norman and then\nI don't know the order after that Sylvia\nSheila and Sandra so I'm\nIn any case she had raise these children she was a housewife that was\nUm\nThat was a point of great pride to her and her husband dies just to go to work and never ask a person for a soul live very simply\nSaved provided for her own health care when she was older and it's up to be said for that there's something to be said for the strength\nWhat what what do you call that\n[noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one\nThere will be an invasion because America can control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match a four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers just seven thousand so any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is and I honestly don't know how you can\nDescribe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no but what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before\nBut I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing\nThat men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do\nNothing nothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because\nWhat's in your house we want we're just going to live there now if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house would you want the police to do nothing\nWould you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just that you know why they're not common for you know here they are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I shouldn't be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders\nThe new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act are truly examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures\nThat's why we should have\nA border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door\nAnd stops all of the side windows and the back\nDoor and trees the country needs either serious policy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\n\nBut I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and so far when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program direction by numbers\nLet's take a look at election by a numbers fellows do tell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get policy with a chart a little bit because we have had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of a toss up category you have to make it the polling has been close and now we start to try and move them around a little bit more aggressively\nAs we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are only three tossup races or we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana the polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nA ... and a a Mississippi and North Dakota is going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tossed up still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved to Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points\nPlace falling has a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tossup category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race because you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one as a lean Democrat state um we moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat but\nPolling there [noise] you know I still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer than I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we moved to lean Democrat as well or with the tossup races where most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point er and let's see we've got a New Jersey and Wisconsin and leading Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is a lot it's starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we see no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big hope for a pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by ten Joe mansion I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro cabin I'll vote yeah I'm In the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nProbably the most calm and can under control that Donald Trump was in the entire election was in the last couple of weeks\nIf you remember he gave Hillary nothing nothing after that tape came out right and that was probably a month before the election last three weeks he gave her nothing\nShe had nothing to say he was crazy on he was I mean as rock solid has he has been as under control is he's been no crazy tweets none of it he didn't play any of those games like you said the election and that's when he closed the entire gap was down by\nEight in the polls are so uh when after the the tape came out and closed it to a much ... you know tighter margin and wound up winning obviously you know it's funny that seems to be going the other way with right now I mean like he's talking obviously about a lot about the they're talking about a potential\nUh executive order to end birthright citizenship he's talking about\nUm he's been more aggressive right and that that may be good it may not be good we're going to see right now\nI don't think it is I think you know look you've already made your mind up with Donald Trump and then there there's a point to where he like I don't want any more information I don't want any new information or I Know what I mean I'm I'm I'm happy with the way things are going but I'm not thrilled Kevin you can you just\nHelp me as a citizen I just feel like everything is normal you know what I mean ... and he reminds people in a normal and right before an election that's not necessarily what you need\nThat makes sense ah yeah I think that's probably true\nBecause he made his strong stand with Kavanaugh he made that strong stand we know where he stands on the border mhm there's no reason to to get continue to dog pile and and quite honestly I I Wish he would stop the\nPresses our enemy I understand what he means and I'm going to be doing some stuff on the press today a that is a a I mean it ... out of control\nBut that enemy the you know there is the enemy of the people it's just bad phrase allergy that makes me feel uncomfortable I think\nWe have to also back up and say that this is not just the just the Trump election right offices election for individuals in individual districts and there's a lot of storylines particularly in the Senate where you know there's a lot of storylines that could decide it I think the issue a overall however uh there's a\nThe momentum the is not in favor of of Republicans right now particularly in the house and you're seeing more movement or it's dangerous to the Democratic side right now but I mean they know who knows I mean this doesn't mean that that's the way it's going to turn out\nUm it's just it's not you'd hope to be having a nice run right now where you're going to the image like for example the lead up to the presidential election was a positive run\nFor Trump in Denver and Republicans remember they you know a month before but I'm an eight or nine points they close that gap all the way almost with polls\nAre so it was not a the momentum clearly showed it was behind a Trump leading up to that election and obviously he won here it's a little bit it's not I wouldn't say it's dramatically to the left but it does seem to be leaving that will get out and vote do not sit this election out get out and vote Mm\nFox News I'm Chris foster President Trump says he'll sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship that's automatic citizenship for babies born in the United states he tells the show acts the ozone HBO\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in as a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits tree they kill is ridiculous and it has to end at least\nThirty countries have some form of birthright citizenship in this country of falls into the fourteenth amendment to the constitution adopted an Eighteen sixty eight president says he's been advised that he has the legal authority to reverse it he didn't say when he might signed that executive order President Trump heads to Pittsburgh this afternoon\nThe president and first lady are set to visit the neighborhood of squirrel hill home to the tree of life synagogue where police say a gunman opened fire on Saturday his visit comes as the first victims funerals are set for today foster son Jay powers [noise] this is talk to [noise]\n\nLike I Am I counting for for less than four five seven seven fat or something like that so [noise] prepare mine ... who ... who are held by now profitable for seven\nEleven [noise]\nGlenn Beck program [noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr patch grey who ah perceives this program on the blaze radio and television network a and also has his a podcast that you can listen to and download at your leisure welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem well problem it's an executive order I'd agree with them [laughter]\nSo you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter]\nIt was not the justification yeah it is the justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally okay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out you know what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday\nEverything after the tenth amendment basically is a read a ration\nIs just to reiterate or did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to pay for that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and they get I'll stop it yeah you're gee you literally Democrats\nKnock it off ... yes their children are citizens to ... this was right this is not about coming over here and having a baby and then you know sneaking in cross that having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here\nLudicrous somewhat that was ... and so it's what I took her to know all this time right but you can't you can't do it with an executive no but\nIf he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court and kind of okay with it\nYeah and that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because of they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included\nAnd it will be internally there is yeah I seen it would be interesting to see how that shakes out because you know one of the things we praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was just going to be fascinating yeah and it does happen imagine\nChuck Schumer and ah and Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court\nIn and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh\nReally I mean you can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and we say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which it's interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's a pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone so far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMay go um [noise]\nYou know in a week people\nGet to make a decision is if the Americans they want to live in because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a porn behavior I get that guy really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about face forward talking about as bad hair day there that was done intentionally\nTo send a message\nTo white nationalist says about me that much\nBut I'm going to watch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nNot that I'm I'm not gonna let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know so twisted they well and that's from ... hard core conservative yeah she's got her own nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not I mean not at least not at that desk send a good friend\nIt's nothing to do is wait on your job since George Soros is an atheist [laughter]\nGot to find out about ...\nI I mean is it is absolutely incredible first of all the number one person on the ah on the death list for Jews you know the most targeted you in America is Ben Shapiro men Shapiro well Ben Shapiro\nNow the Trump people love Ben Shapiro I mean most conservatives do conservatives love Ben Shapiro we don't like George Soros so how do you weigh that one but in policy\nBased policy but and they know it they know they say they're doing the same thing as they were doing with a ... when you said wait a minute social if he's a socialist you're a racist for saying that you don't let this work doesn't make any sense don't like to do that this is there's this does not even a warrant a response\nOr at least a serious response hidden there\nThey have become a joke and have become everything they said they despised\n[noise] do you think about ...\nPadre background leverage is going to be a or something you can also join your

a pain that was kind of constant uh there were mainly like\nSports injuries you know old sports injuries you know like\nYears getting huge my natural huge yeah and yeah you had some inflammation all over your body fat okay ... but even that you really had a serious problem and and you're not alone here and you took really factor and it's been a huge difference in your life I took really factor\nActually kind of almost that as a last result over last resort because I don't buy into these you know it's a hundred percent natural really yeah doc give me something stronger and a and this has really remarkably changed my life I've gotten my life back my pain is absolutely under control and it's all because\nOf relief factor of three weeks Nineteen Ninety five and Seventy percent of people who ordered the three week quick start going to order more white\nAt all you have to look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said\nRaul socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist\nNow when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite that's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is not\n[noise] I did I did and they basically taken the position that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is\nIs a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so and my wife is Mexican she's a first generation\nAh you know a a Mexican American ... it's ... they\nUse this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't the tack mode and it's something that it it it\nGoes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous Lee\nLeft leaning and you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided it only tell one side of the story so that is when I saw this\nI said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that so that's what I ... it was it was astonishing kind of moment to to\nCall out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on is purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that the what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by so few people\nAnd it was just such a fear for Louisiana work and one way and it and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where very it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of their conservative\nUm and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets us think of them on conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very the unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they started you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know I I I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking this any more you see the rating start to go down but now it's our time now there's this new frontier for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red told America that's on the heart radio a pod cast or cheating on her radio excuse me I heart radio ac\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you\nI'm Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people\nLooked at Megan Kelly inside while she's a great gift she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own kind of sixty minutes kind of person I'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her\nAnd that's when the social justice warriors all around them remind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um\nAnd no you can't play nice and you have\nTo destroy her and\nSo they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it they did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know print brave in doing that\nUm I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet and here's a woman in the meat to moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to\nA man I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of her because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened and egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red build America you can hear it on the uh I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taken on a few issues and I want to come and go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and loading ships Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion what what are your thoughts on the caravan\n[noise] you know I think that it is something that [noise] for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on\nUm in regards to our borders are open borders I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nOr that's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow a to construction workers\nThat um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about that have lost their jobs\nTo to a much cheaper labor that comes across the border\nAnd I think that we're seeing this year I think that this caravan it is not for political refugee status these people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the the most vulnerable people in the United states will look and I think it's\nWhat's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\nYou know that's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent feel some of that because a lot of these kinds of\nA labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the the homeless crisis and you in Los Angeles is is that there is is the drug epidemic there are there's a thing called patient and we actually have a story coming out on that\nI'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare to fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers and then when they end up using them using the the health insurance up\nThey ended up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically go to rehab tourists\nPlus what's happening to the economy\nWe ...\nWe are we should all hold our breath and not do anything to add to the chaos\nBut the time is coming where we're gonna have to pay for the mistakes of the past when it does\nI recommend that you think like all of the other central banks around the world and you have something that is real intangible now is the time to go to gold line and get their important to risk information and find out of gold or silver is right for you\nKnow you you don't have to do that if you're not convinced by what I'm just saying they've put a special report together on what it means if the Democrats take one or both houses of Congress\nAnd it's pretty eye opening and what it means read this report it's free just go and call gold line now one eight six six gold line one eight six six gold line asked them for the Freeh report they'll send it to you and I'm telling you it's bone chilling\nAnd it's real\nWhat happens because of this election eight six six gold liner go lie dot

migrants caravan save me from a democratic oversight\nHe's trying to stay on message despite the Pittsburgh massacre and the fallout from the wave of mail bombs that means he's bashing the fake news while newsrooms or on a heightened state of security alert\nAnd it seemed to care about that with me when they were attacking me and my family was under attack\nThat means he's talking about a migrant invasion at the southern border while authorities examined the Pittsburgh shooters hatred of invaders\nAnd Jews he's scheduled to travel to Pittsburgh on Tuesday even though the mayor has urged him to postpone is visit it's likely to be a very big story on Tuesday\nThere was a White House scolding\nSarah Sanders surprised the press corps by scheduling of rare White House briefing on Monday at the
