because people are going to be hurt because we're we're we're seeing mobs start to form here it is\nI Believe it's the overreaction of the left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh\nYou're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without\nA doubt that there's no other one is just put a stop on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia too long ago I thought oh I Hope we saw chasing we've right what about the\nPeople who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that\nCivil protest or is that a mob I think if he is a ... yeah and if there was a party or as we call it um out for sure come on I ... I mean because I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court and banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight now I'm trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded\nCannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what didn't dancey below sea do during the health care bill she and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't\nDo you remember where they tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become of violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd\nIn Washington DC you would not have been pretty it would not have been\nPretty and by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob they're charging cities and they're taking over that's me I shouldn't say that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob you know did you define mob please look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that is this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that say that their usage so is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are\nTrying to what it was a lot of times on causing truck in tents on causing trouble I mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not the only thing trouble I mean if you going to go down that road I guess the other end that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nJust as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media\nDoes not see harassing conservatives that's causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a parade seated says like the you know there it's basically you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good\nFor the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean they are by the Irish guy who runs his own or\nLet me tell you these white people white people really do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay so let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob me yes I'm going to call it a mob\nA now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtests is guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy\nFor what a mob a protest that looks like he is a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech he said why is that things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he said knock the crap out of them are what you and seriously okay that's not the hell I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push\nProtesters guaranteed to sorry sorry [noise]\n[laughter]\nTill they go where we see them now here's\nHere's the problem let's wretched things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says ... I think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but\nWhat is it realizes that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which state's college was nearly killed the guy shooting a football field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] basically who's almost killed he was showing this is for health care hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and that's why ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to do things\nI feel that there's going to be in a fascination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation ... getting their face there to realize that they bear some responsibility of this old extra violence\n[noise] so do you remember the time when people like brick Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target a district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested for the Tea Party\nRiots mobs how many\n[noise] News I'm terribly

that it is almost always the left and in particular the communist or Marxist left\nThat is behind the civil\nUnrest if you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots in in Sioux gets that's you know a paragraph each\nBut after the communist manifesto well then you start to get some interesting\nRiots usually called strikes\nNow some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these\nCome from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first to a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\nClan goes real resurgence and he was heavily involved in it he reads advocated a military ended all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again\nIn the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen on word well that's because of re segregation and all of the things that are progressive\nPlanted alright but let me just go through and see if you can find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike May Day riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike any of those\nSeems a labor related I was the last labor related doesn't it and labor who\nI'm Sorry if you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world who are the international workers' of the world that is of course are based in communist yeah Mars is it is the communist army here\nIn America the international workers' of the world unite rise up against your oppressors\nYou also had in Nineteen sixteen the preparedness day bombing in San Francisco a you had a um [noise] uh you had read summer which was about twenty of them you had made a riots\nYou had the scent trail you a massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing\nThat was the left and communist saying you you can't get involved in the war\nBecause it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop the best way to say that we're icicle is with a bomb right this trail you a massacre if I'm not mistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization that was against\nA all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up\nRioting and killing people okay good then you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nIt's essential earlier was a an industrial workers of the world by\n... thank you okay Minneapolis ah Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore strike do you even know what that one was\nThat when that happened that may ninth through October twelve that one's shut down San Francisco bay a the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle of the overpass the republic steel strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots\nHave communist and Marxist fingerprints on them\nI said it's it's fundamental to the ideology right revolution is fundamental to the ideologies or it's not surprising that this was happening\nAgain so I just I'm I'm really tired of of sharing a\nOr I should say this way I'm really tired of the media and there lies\nUnder Cover up for history and truth\nThis is who we are and will stand\nYou just seem to want to fight I Am not with you high look to win a plan\nYou missed any of the show today [laughter] no problem ... dot com slash contest to listen to on demand whenever and wherever you are free that Glenn Beck dot com slash talk [noise] [noise]\nIf you experienced pain on a daily basis I Know exactly how you feel it can be debilitating it can control your life\nThe aches are easy to understand when it really hurts to do the basic chores emotionally the effects of pain can be just as dramatic I have spoken to so many people in this audience that started to take relief factor that changed emotionally is as\nDramatic as the physical relief maybe even more as you might know Tonya and I started taking really factor several months ago\nAfter about ten days subtle changes started to become significant and I've been able to stop taking all prescription pain medications all pain medications entirely and stop the terrible side effects of those awful\nDrugs many on my team here at the blaze are faithful takers of the one hundred per cent drug free relief factor and we have had great success in taking our lives back cry it get a three week quick start package early Nineteen Ninety five take it as\nDirected that's less than a dollar per day and if it works on you like it has with me you're going to get your life back relief factor dot com\nJudge Gibson here President Trump defines leadership the first major tax reform a Thirty Years' unemployment at an Eighteen year low jobless claims lowest since Nineteen Seventy three the Dow highest ever milestone achievements and now noble gold has mutated and exclusive collectors being twenty twenty President Trump freedom point\nOne side in images Donald Trump other side lists all his major achievements commemorative one ounce coin is the only presidential Trump coin made Ninety nine point nine percent silver not silver plated and its IRA approved\nAs the price of silver rises so will the value of these point go to the Trump coin twenty twenty dot com use the code district to save five dollars per call or text history to five eleventh I live so the Trump point twenty twenty dot com [noise] the silver twenty twenty\nPresident Trump freedom point available for a limited time only go to the Trump point twenty twenty dot com today ...
