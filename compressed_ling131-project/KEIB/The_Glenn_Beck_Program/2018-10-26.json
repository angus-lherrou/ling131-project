... from England cod [noise] God\n[noise] and of course they would go on to great battle [noise] amazing whether Shakespeare's writing about it\nOr whether in tales of the Scots William Wallace is battles\nThe mainstream media has been painfully obvious that they are not fans of Donald Trump on many occasions the attacks that are that they have\nA ... have been the hitting him with and then\nSilently retracting are false but also the media has been under attack by the White House for very long time\nIt's not an issue with just the current administration\nAnd stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to say anything\nAbout it the crazy thing is today\nThe craziest thing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was ... the FBI and the de OJ against\nThe press Donald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the\nOh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail this president is calling us fake news\nYeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in jail he was ...\nThe government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\n\nAs a media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an article\nOn the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is what you know just just put this in your pipe\nAnd smoke it for a little bit\nThere being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta and while\nThis is happening the New York times is printing ... there's an article titled five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter\nFive novel lists imagined Trump's next chapter the main image\nAt the top of this story shows the White House on fire and thinking into the ground as President Trump waves goodbye each novelists had one assignment right out what you think happens after the bowler investigation is completed okay [laughter]\nSo let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's gonna happen immediately after\nAnd you mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come to the prize\nThey found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty\nEvery single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one in fiction writer to write something where Trump was not guilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment a and another even had him of being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated we're not advocating violence I don't know what's what do you what are you are you kidding me know that\nIt was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible [laughter] oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNo I understand that everybody has an opinion but five for writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's got to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable how is it\nThe two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American media is writing this bull crap while the pipe bombs are coming in\nThis this time's piece exhibit a for why journalism is currently dead in America it is dead in America\nAll of you dancing on the grave of Megan Kelly\nReally what was her was her big thin she asked\nA question that oh my gosh lock her in a tower oh my gosh she's got to be chased out of the public so you can ask a question don't you dare ask a question\nThis is frightening America fact\nIs gone the media has already made up their mind they know the answer and if you disagree they will chase you out of the public square they have ...\nOh inclination to actually at even attempt to find the truth even attempt to understand\n\nYes there's little righteous indignation and me it's not an anger is it is righteous indignation\nBecause I have called these people I have talked to these people\nI have gone to them over and over again we've had in hand and said listen you need to understand how half the country feels\nJust have a conversation you're making a huge error and yes I made all these errors oh my gosh I'm the worst person in the world I'm with you just listen to me please you have to hear what half the country is saying\nThey won't do it they're not interested they don't care and now they're quite literally making it up what's the difference between a novelist and the New York times journalist I don't know\nMedia [noise]\n[noise] this is a radical concept and I know you like radicals you love radicals\nYou you still there is nothing wrong with being radical mob yeah those are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nHere's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake you might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[noise] [laughter]\n... over twenty that take a ride back program [noise]\nSelf awareness seems to be dead at this point you know in the media in particular Glen or maybe this one what is the one thing that if you're a conservative Trump makes the ACA criticisms of the media they say\nHey it's fake news hey these guys are relying hey they're the enemy of the people and they say that famous violence\nIn fact the fact they go on the New York times in fact bomb makers generally\nAvoid attaching visible clock their devices really keep from tipping off they're targeting no about when the bombs are said to explain it was just a like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death that's what I thought\nOh look at that and you're like that's not a bomb here here's a bonus if you survive it that it got an handler was one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're it is weird now look it could it be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this pay someone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures\nBut aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually wanna kill say one of the idea that if they pull you want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong only horror despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like my mom if you look on\nI mean you get this example of this on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend to do it they don't intend on a you know you start to happen to for example Dana lash right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least I Know one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often ends and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look a terrorist I mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would\nUh execute a terrorist attack\nOn on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I said is\nHe is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens however obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether they're a in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending these things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a big media circus if things are all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work and they're really all that's all the information we have right now\nWell but I Know that's that's pretty much all the information they had on the race dog fire and um I don't know about you but I think the Germans behaved admirably I think the Germans did exactly how to do with you on that one no\nBut this is the rice done then communist did then right Glenn\n... News I'm Chris\nFoster and eleven and a twelve package had been found similar to the explosive devices sent this week to other critics of President Trump won in Florida address New Jersey senator Cory Booker and one in New York City we're told the dress to former national intelligence director know CNN analyst James Clapper\nThe fans are being analyzed by the FBI for DNA the FBI is now reaching out to retailers to pin down the origin nation of the package bond elements and where they were sold from the pipe to them and now on the low\nFox's Catherine heritage the last big economic number before the midterm elections is just released by the Commerce Department\nThe economy continue to expand it is strong pace during the summer quarter the gross domestic product which measures all goods and services and the economy grew three and a half percent this follows a four point two percent pace of growth in the spring quarter\nBoxes Ginny ... tech stocks are way down this morning this is Fox News [noise]\nFifty\n[noise] Glenn Beck\nAnd Bill O'Reilly Georgia's that about half an hour for no pads gray from pat gray at least heard every day uh just prior to this program on the blaze radio and television network\nA and you can sign up for his pod cast a really great podcasts lots of laughs and lots of insight path gray unleash wherever you get your podcasts\nPat should we talk a little bit about Megan Kelly\nYes in the heinous horrific crime she committed I'm surprised ... still walking around in this society sincerely has she been imprisoned yet I don't think so and she needs to be she dangerous\nWell she has you know she is violated something that NBC feels passionate about to\nDo well he started to they didn't feel that passionately about it when Jimmy Fallon dressed up in blackface as Chris Rock wait what he dressed up in imitated Chris Rock and yeah but I'm from what network though I'm well over there\nThat was on NBC ... NBC that end up paying network anywhere really worked for ... dress up as blackmail no no it it might be okay for Halloween if you are not making fun of someone right so she wasn't making\nFun of well he was he was kind of making fun of ... he was imitating ... odd you know it's even more ... than that though and it's it's ...\nIt's despicable that we have to play this game and it's okay for all of them are the Jimmy Kimmel thing with good ... imitating Carl Malone do we have that audio yet Sarah my gosh I Am not one has agreed oh we have a rather listen to this is\nJimmy Kimmel in blackface\nSometime and night home alone look up and sky and say what the hell's going on welfare reform live on another planet\nHolding a whole lot in the wild home loan rate on TV about white people getting out to buy earlier and all kind of hell of a damn thing\nHome alone ever seen a flying saucer hisself folk festival real spoke at times almost say sadly stop just\nHang out that's just give me ... it's unbelievable unbelievable we talked about you imagine even even talking that way no without blackface just talking that way it would be our last\nDay it'd be gone you know I talked to a of a couple of different examples of blackface are being used in comedy very recently I get in those Sunday in Philadelphia was one of the examples we brought up\nBut it's an insult was sending in Philadelphia they did it and they did it as for a minute they're making a point right like that only be more on ... characters on this show would think that that's an appropriate thing mhm\nThis gimme came of it is just saying hey I'm black and I'm Carl Malone it just him mocking a black person\nYeah a mind the way he ... and the only thing that speak the only thing that's funny about that is the way he speaks yeah yeah that's it mhm I mean play that again tell me the joke in here other than the way he's speaking what was it the Ebonics\nIsn't that what they call and then the third person that's the only other I think he's doing right now listen to this [noise]\nI mean the joke to some time and I call oh look up and sky and say what the hell's going on out there will fall into another\nPlanet phone home like in the\nHome loan rate on TV about why people getting to the doctor by Elena Kagan all on a halo effect but\nMean they're not a single joke 'cause they'll ... returning as Karl Malone always did no not always but often did referring to himself in third person and it's a random topic of the only other part of that basic yeah and he's a black face right like better so unbelievable to get\nCut again at the end the Jimmy Fallon one more because Jimmy Fallon has not a political enemies him Kimball has put himself in as a political commentator so it's really agree just for him but Fallon who is I think there's no ill intent\nAnd he found doing that bit he's friends with Chris Rock writing but the issue here is on the freaking NBC yeah\nYou can spirit is a wire legality for mentioning it but you know like Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but place in your network so what\nShe said was weight but if you are if you\nAre holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if\nYou're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with Diana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making fun of and she's not making fun of\nDiana Ross well isn't that what Fallon did actually didn't ask the question he says ... ...\n... ... ... you brought up a great point yesterday Glenn I thought about this as we were getting close to we're getting close to Halloween ... ... the biggest deal in the world was made of finally African Americans have a superhero Black Panther finally they have

and everything else but like\nHe is the passion comes out because you know he's been on the wrong side of it here for a while or the passion comes out when the media is mentioned and there was a lot

percent\nWhatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose to fight back\nTrump did and he said I'm not going to let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter they see me as a person who strikes back when attacks so while I'm going to do that so then you have to say okay well\nStarted the fracas who started this\nAnd you can make a case said Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow how how did he he was just telling people names yeah he's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your cable feeling beaten and kicked to death\nBy being called racist and homophobia and everything else came later\nWhen it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win see what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could\nDo anything you want to have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear that's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed\nAnd I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump counter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very ...\nAnd sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah you know liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that\nBut he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it is because it gives them no quarter yes\nHe fights back\nBut now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back like Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if that fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where they were not responsible for any of it all in all ... us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh how much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times\nLiterally paragraph thirty five in the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us from the jump of course they're cartoon bombs they are the only thing it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this is written by mayor yes was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worst bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt it could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these the depressed we're gonna send these to all of the all of the enemies of the right candidate or we'll obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence with midterms I'll put my money on putting\nYou [laughter] how do you do and how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank withheld political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that is why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly\n... how would the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out or the or Washington DC think tanks progressive think tanks bass and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this or maybe the person sending it was insane or you know that kinda thing they'll never say well gee maybe um our side\nIs so craves now that we have to criticize our side you're never going to see that ever\nBack with Bill O'Reilly and the rest of the news of the week in just a second [noise]\nSo [noise] does this change the election what's going on [noise]\nI Will tell you if the [noise]\nIf the house and the Senate or lost uh we're in for an amazing wild ride a especially economically I think we are already in for a wild ride and one of the reasons I'm becoming more and more concerned about the trade war um but imagine\nImagine if the house in the Senate or just a house or controlled or what is the president going to be able to do uh on the economy what does the president going to be able to do without a Congress or when it comes to just the skirmish on the border\nYou imagine if you imagine what that is going to be like\nGold line has just put a report together a on what you can expect if there is a democratic victory you can get this report for free just by calling them I don't know if you've been paying attention to the stock market um but you know instead of this ah this this bombing things from somebody who is clearly\nEither incompetent unstable or just wants attention\nBut we should be paying attention to what's happening in the stock market what's happening with the economy read this report I've read it I've already shared it\nYou need to get it to its free all you have to do is call gold line right now and ask them for their election report a doorway called them now eight six six gold line one eight six six gold line or gold line dot com [noise]\nEvery day it seems like we turn on the news and you have absolutely no idea what's going to go on its war in Syria another mass shooting a terrorist attack another indictment and the Mueller investigation a mudslide an earthquake an inexplicable\nDrop in the stock market it's crazy that's why you need to prepare not because you're paranoid or pessimistic because every day sunrise can bring a beautiful day or a terrible nightmare the difference between people who are going to leave\nYeah and survive and the people who are going to get lost or whether or not they're prepared since ... eleven we've been partnered with the folks

put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash going into ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth the George Soros or people like him did this but if you know it's\nIt's one of his things they've done in the past yes but the the government of Honduras should be able to trace foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here\nSo\n... I Hope they do that if they if they believed Cuban Venezuela are actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and then by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nThere or to let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following his one uh and I would love to hear when we come back what you think the president should do uh what do you think it looks like\nIf they do arrive at the border\nAre and how the press is going to treat this and what do sane Americans do to counter that when we come back with Bill O'Riley [noise]\nFifty [noise]\nFox News I'm Chris foster lap or in New York City were Fox's Brian yes report\nYou also know from postal worth or is that the package looked exactly like it resembled those packages that we have seen throughout the week the manila envelope the sticks excessive postage stamps with the American flag on them the block lettering\nPresident Trump just read

I mean this is Fox News [noise]\nFifty [noise]\n\nYou're not going to climb down from for Bill O'Reilly bill let me lay out a scenario here and you tell me where it's where I'm off days\nI don't think of this caravan helps the Democrats in the ... mid term elections and it's why\nThe press is saying oh there's no there's no evidence that they're going to come all the way to the border and they're dismissing it and that's just a crazy conspiracies the things they get all the Trump supporters all wound up there all dismissing this now\nUm I I Can't believe that the they're going to make it by the mid term election I think this is the to the to arrive\nAfter the mid term election a and a possible new Democratic House which will throw us into chaos hey you think there's any the reality in their ... be what do you see coming in and how things are going to shake out\n[noise] why I said on Bill O'Reilly dot com I now who says that the Mexican government will break up\nA lot of the uh the caravan before\nThey start getting on to vehicles 'cause they're not going to walk to Macau in Texas or to wanna\nUm San Diego sector and they're not gonna do it so they're at a they're approaching a or a railway term is now in Mexico some of them will get on trains heading north Austrians have to stop and Mexico City and that's why I Believe the Mexican government to start to intervene\nUm some of them will make it I'm\n... now and they're not going to walk so you don't think it'll be a mass\nNada break 'em up that's what you know look the state department palm pay I was down there now I mean he's screaming at them now that you know if you let these people en masse go to the border we're gonna take economic reprisals on Mexico and that's what they'll do it and they know it so they'll break it up\nBut some people will reach and some people would get they're mostly in vehicles are much where the smugglers command the cartels come in a ... a ... to yet I saw radios vehicles down there um you can do trains you can do a whole bunch of stuff but\nWhen it gets to that point they um border authorities will put up barriers new barriers and there'll be manned by us troops and there'll be no way for the migrants to get to any us official to apply for asylum jobs already said he's going to do that he has to do it\nOn the left is hoping for some kind of violent confrontation that is what they would like to see\n'em but I agree with you that this is not helping the Democratic party I'm In the vote ten days from that how bad it's hurting them it depends what section of the country you rent\nOr do you uh um do you see the the\nPossibility that real radicals would like to set up a a Palestinian uh Israel situation at our border and it would be handled exactly the same way by the media\nThey handle the Palestinians and Israel they they show the big bad state beating up on the on the little guy do you I mean I I said two years ago\nThis is what our border is eventually going to look like they're going to set up a a Palestinian standing in kind of situation and we're going to be Israel I mean they've already done this you know one of the small stage\nBring it you know bring it to Broadway bring it to the American border and that's the way they'll play it\nMay be but there's all the ... the Mexican government does all want that\nOr they don't they ... they don't want they got problems on the border um ... you know war is one of the worst places in the world Tijuana right behind\nThey don't want all this because it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster from Mexico these people only facilities that they are the water they need food Mexican people are poor\nThere's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah so how do they love shanty\nTowns there with a mother is in babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and what the man sure but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so how do you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian

[noise]\n[noise] this\nIs a Fox News alert to more suspicious packages of turned up in the mail this morning I'm Dave Anthony one was intercepted in Florida address the Democratic senator Cory Booker the other was sent a former director of national intelligence turned to Trump critic James Clapper founded a post office in New York City\nI remember a story are being told by an instructor in the military being told of convoy that was ambushed after having a Humvee take a hit from an ...\nHe was treated um he was a treated a and the wounded man and needed to carry one of the soldiers off to another Humvee to be medivac out\nOne of the soldiers had his arm severed just below the elbow and it was in shock he handed the soldiers his own arm after applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out that wasn't able to walk the man looked at his own sever an army and his hand and repeatedly told the medic\nThat helped him that his arm was fine and this was in his arm sometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid weeks I lie to myself and my daughter was fine and this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us and I broke down in tears finally able to process what had fallen my now seven year old daughter\n\nMy wife forgave me for spending those two weeks it wasn't until months after\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing all I wanted to do after she told me about this was find this uh this guy and cut off the offending appendages\n\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in my Sunday school class for ten months\n\nI had been teaching this boy in Sunday school\n\nThough how I hated and wanted to hate this young man I wanted to ruined his life before it even began\n\nI wanted to let you know\nThat in the height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\n\nWho's the last couple of chapters and I heard you speak that I\nI realized that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me I needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all men\nI forgave him in my heart\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my outrage and my anger lifted\nYes the pain of what happens still lingers and the reality of the situation is still very real but my outlook in my spirit or no longer held hostage by my hate\n\nI just wanted to thank you for writing this book it literally helped me pick myself out of darkness so deep\nThat I felt there was no way out\n\nI wanted to let you know that your work has helped save at least\nOne guy Christian\n\n\nChristian as a um\n\n[noise] as a man who has gone through a similar situation recently with one of my children\n\n\nAnd I thank God we caught it before anything happened\nI understand I understand\n\nWe knew the address of the man who um did this to my son\n\nAnd I think if it would have happened and I wasn't home my wife may have killed him\n\n\nI think about it all the time to think about my children all the time\nAnd\n\n\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me\nOr I haven't talked to my wife about it\n\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\nHow we're responsible I have been to not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\n\nThere are things that we do want to think about that are truly frightening\nAnd I think\nWhen we look at our country when we look and we really realize\n\nWhat we really stand to lose it's not our job spend our money it's the unsinkable\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us that happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoided and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you said if somebody if you said to everybody you met in the next two weeks you know you look like you could use some cheering up\n\nI think you'd be right about eighty or Ninety percent of the time\n\nAcross all income levels across all colors and boundaries\n\nWe're all struggling with something and we all have something big to forgive that man we don't want to\n\nBut the reality is we need each other my kids\nHated the fact that I talked about in ... when they were growing up that endurance was one of the virtues that you had to have or you're not going to make it you have to endure endure life is endurance\nLife is about the long run not the short run endure it to the end they hated that that you're always so pessimistic\nNo I'm not I'm telling you\nThere's a lot in life that you were going to have to endure that you're going to hate life is not what do you think it is when you're a kid it's just not it's harder than that but it's so worth it\nBut we need to be like a cross country team\n\nFor going to survive this we don't cheer the person who came across first we cheered the person who came across the finish line in the last as well\nBecause we're all different runners we all have different things going on and it is truly about beating your last time doing just slightly better than you did last time\nBeing slightly better than you were yesterday\nAnd if we can help each other and cheer each other on with that will make it gets harder and harder every day\n\nIn the hopes that somebody that needs to hear this we'll hear this from you today you're not alone you're not alone were in this together and we're going to make it\nIf I were to ask you before this can you sketch out what you think this guy's Japan looks like you would have picked but yeah it covered in decals and seemingly political messages I it yet I Can't quite zoom in to see exactly what they say and they've covered the van there now covering it so with blue tarp so no one can see it yeah uh but uh it\nDeep you we've had a blurry picture of it and it looks like it may be a guy on the right\nOr at least a ... you know it's hard to tell exactly there's certainly political messages all over and flags all over it does appear to be the ... picture of Trump and the presidential seal I mean could it be\nA it could be either to be I don't like this guy's president right out I mean I Know it you know again this is what people are speculating at this point if it's hard to see honestly from the pictures you'll get a picture pretty soon though that's clear I'm sure\nI'm you know they were going to find this out relatively quickly yeah where this guy goes I mean this is a really quick arrest it does support the idea\nThat he was a you know as does the fact that zero the bombs went off completely incompetent and crazy I mean the fact that you you mail bombs and they're finding you this quickly is it you know shows a lack of level of sophisticated on it really does yeah so we'll see uh we're gonna know fairly quickly I think oh this guy\nMay be just a really bad incompetent version of the Bernie Sanders guy uh that was competent when he was trying to kill all the the Republicans are about a year ago looks like this may be\nOur version of that guy fortunately our version if you will is a completely inept and incompetent and no one was hurt\n\nYeah I mean I ... if if if that's true what the van ... and we don't know and should be noted of course he is absolutely not my guy [laughter]\nYou know I Know it but it was but there are going to say he's not my guy either yeah but you know they're going to assign him as you know this is what a Trump supporter is like and blah blah blah and you know there are those people on both sides and this is why it is so\nA terrifying it's not going to be a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nAre going to be nuts they're going to be absolutely nuts uh and uh and that's what's\nFrightening is ... the media just puts all of the nut jobs on the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports some but they certainly say well that's not\nThat's not you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you why is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy from Bernie that that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nAnd as we said at the time a Bernie Sanders is not responsible for shooting at a baseball field endures Donald Trump responsible for this as any logical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to note um but you know again this is we were not going to know enough about this this is but this is a product\nOf the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are creating this\nUm and you know it's not going to stop until both sides realize it until the media says okay wait a minute\nWhat do we do what did we do that makes you think that we're the enemy what did we do and actually listen to half the country\nThen we can move forward and to create a better tomorrow\nThis is a Fox News alerts postal tracking and postal markings on some of the package as Florida had been described to us as a region of interest in the investigation rehab federal agents as well as postal inspectors\nDescending on US postal facilities just outside of a wonder if the Miami airport we understand that they did a space of that plus the facility and they also had to review of the TV footage I specifically on the cell service nail kiosks inside that the sun and the oath I lock off the\nFelony and also a surveillance\nFootage from the surrounding businesses source\nTells Fox is is a white man in his fifties the suspect who's been arrested before from making terroristic threat [noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts [noise]\nThe [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nAnd I plan to kind of looked like we may have the guy who was sending the package bombs we know now he lives in\nFlorida has a criminal history has ties to New York they have wrapped his a white van up so you can't see anything because he looks like a crazy mad as one of those\nYou know it's one of those vans where there's stickers over every bit of it um we're not sure it looks like he was a Donald Trump or a big\nBig big big big big big big big big big big big\nCrazy big fan of Donald Trump emphasis on crazy [laughter] ah you know but we we don't know for sure because it looks like that's what those stickers are but we don't have a clearer picture of it yeah\nYeah I'm get get going Internet I mean we don't want to see how long have we have to wait until this is two thousand Eighteen I Want to immediately I Want to know this is the one that guy in which our ago I went this guy in jail right now I Want to know and speaking of that by the way mhm I mean isn't the bigger problem here don't we just\nStopped selling vans\nBy ... white fan stop telling white vans and arrest all people who own white vans that if you're driving around in the white van right now we'll give you like to know a good solid\nNo no we not Europe to no good if you're driving a white van right now we know you're up to no good what did you smell\nWhat what what was it was there ... or is it about which one was where were you know at home sleeping last night can you verify that you have witnesses do you have do you have a discount the fact that makes it look like an ice cream truck she can learn a little kids and everything\nI said I bet you're doing what else would you do with the white van yeah ... well in the business uses and\nNo they wouldn't be this show no they'd bring up all sorts of things it it I mean if they have their own show they can make that point I suppose was when the guy wasn't the guy in Virginia [laughter] was it so if you disagree with is get your own show a pleasant the guy in Virginia didn't he have a van to\nI thought he was living in his van or something wasn't ...\nYeah it's I think you're right yes he was because he went to um he he would be that the YMCA the local YMCA so when the shooting happened they knew where he was and they knew who he was because he was very he he lived in another state and drove there should basically camped out there and prepare\nFor the shooting right and he was he was a Bernie Sanders guy a big big big big big big big big crazy big Bernie Sanders guy and he was living in is man\nI mean it's going to be interesting to see I think there's several distinctions to several additional levels to this let's say we find out that this is exactly what is it is the person it is is banned these are pro Trump stickers whatever I mean we don't know any of those things for sure yet uh but if we find that it will be an interesting distinction to see if he is the ... he either a very incompetent\nLunatic who tried to blow up people\nAnd failed hang on more hold on I'm well more than a or he's a a lunatic who ah was just try to scare\nPeople and did not intend to kill people that will be an ... a distinction I Will be interesting in the investigation did you see is when\nI did okay I'm going to guess incompetent [laughter] get get sick of it too because of an like that you know if you're thinking I'm going to put a sticker on my found my van 'cause I Want people to know and maybe it'll change their heart maybe it'll change their mind yeah that man's not\nThat bad it's not that that man is like a ... stay away from this guy\n[noise] my ... let me ask you this guy in in American history looking for\nIn global history in global has has there ever been an individual who has been won over by a massive collection of bumper stickers on a car has anyone ever changed in opinion are considered a new one because someone not from one bumper sticker 'cause I think that's even possible\nBut maybe even a couple of maybe not to write three you're pushing it us three hundred bumper stickers covering all of your windows you are not convincing anyone to your viewpoint I think you know people because of it oh no if you have a nature\nWay you're you're you're going to be kicked out you're going to they're going to tell you to move because you're a spoof to death all of the neighbors even the ... you could be living in the most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood\nWith the holy family and the pope and all of the pro life activist from all the time right and you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we have standards\nYeah you're nuts I just really hope if Jesus comes back or he's not in the van\n[laughter] you know he comes in a white van with you about your bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just like I don't believe this guy there is no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming right oh maybe that's how that's how he does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes from that I Would do [laughter] [laughter] well no no no because I wouldn't be slick enough he would have you know he'd", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "26"}
