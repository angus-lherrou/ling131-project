{"month": "10", "state": "CA", "station": "KEIB", "content": "\n\nKnow [laughter]\nThey we have what is called ... interview in the fall\nOf the few of us because [laughter] why he actually\n[laughter]\nI Am a little nervous over he's both\n[laughter] lazy right over Russia's national was I'm a [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nJames Gregory I discovered I don't know six seven eight years ago [noise] he's a big old fat guy but there's different kinds of fat he's one of those factors just fat all in the middle\nLike somebody this this wearing a a a hoop around them you know what I mean like you've got little feet some fat people are built like they're like Andre the giant or or Paris was on Fox now they're built like they were meant to be back their whole lives\nAnd then you have those people it's like they just got fatter and fatter and fatter but it's almost it's almost small chassis just got\nBigger bigger well he's built like that and when he walks he kind of\n... there's no pivot to the foot there just just like he's walking on block's book [noise] and he walks around the crowd he's got this\nAwful blonde hair piece that's just stuck down on top of it and he's got a mile speech impediment and he is so funny he is one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen and he gets no credit speaking a funny comedians have\nYou seen Chappaquiddick\nChappaquiddick last night in gym gaffe again plays a serious role in yeah he's the U.S attorney in Boston who's ...\nFriends with the Kennedys I thought you know they're going to end up making it okay for Ted Kennedy\nOr they're going to make you think Ted Kennedy's worst human being ever they actually tried to play it pretty straight I did learn a lot about the whole thing a lot that I did not\nAlready know like I didn't know that after he got out that he and his two buddies went back to the site and his two buddies went down on the car went down and and they see her in there and then they come back up\nWell nobody ever reports it she's she's dead in the car that has sunk\nAnd he managed to get out somehow\nI'm of course he's looking out for himself and then the rest of the movie which is the bulk of the movie is about how everyone around him including her dear friends that all anyone is worried about\nIs how do we save his his presidential uh aspirations how do we protect Ted Kennedy because he has to be president\nAnd I thought that was quite telling and quite accurate\nBecause people like that\nThe Clintons are the ultimate example\nPeople like that everyone around them is a non human ... a non factor because all that matters is that person's aspirations everyone else is expendable everyone else's disposable everything is focused on that\nIt's as if that person's career\nIs its own being which is even greater than the individual you know they talk to Ted Kennedy like he's an idiot because he is but then when when the specter of his presidential aspirations comes up it's as if that new being is in the room and that's the thing that is worshipped\nAnd use since that with a lot of politicians and if you've ever been around them if you've ever been around someone with that level of ambition you know exactly what I'm Talking about you know the type of people that you can never actually\nBe close to them you can never actually trust them because they do not have authentic legitimate emotions of love and hate him beer and intimacy and friendship and revenge everything is secondary\nThey couldn't eat kosher they couldn't become rabbis they couldn't live is guarded commanded them\nFor them this is the story of the Jewish people just survive\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why\nNo one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so the world\nJust cited let them have this scrap\nOf land and they say was theirs because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as foretold\n\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and style and couldn't concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nHad a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews but people of all faiths all faiths that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\n\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect\n\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish we help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that a madman went into Philadelphia\nTo try to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\n\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed in the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\n\nThe horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people and yet here we are\nAgain the group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing survive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease anti Semitism is as old as the world from the moment\nGod said I Will make you might people there has been anti\nSemitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always the first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's Washington blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\nThe world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget\nI told you you are in the audience that wheel in the in ... the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence\nThe world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and peculiar people because the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate\nHas begun again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not Iraq Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time\nAnd the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos it always comes in a\nTime of fear it always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society it's why our founders came here in the first place\nIt's why our founders defended the Jews\n\n\nWe're a different country we're at different people we're not better than the rest of the world we just see things differently\n\nAnd if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\n\nOur first gray seal of the United states was the pillar of fire ants pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to\nDo something to earn a living I watch a live\n\nFDR said this generation has a rendezvous with destiny I echo those words\n\nOur generation must be the generation that breaks this cycle there\nIs no one else in the world who will do it who will stand against this onslaught who will stand against their hatred in nationalism and the and the the collective wisdom\nThe extermination of people that just aren't good enough we are headed that way we are headed that way once you cannot talk to your neighbors once the other side has nothing to offer\nYou have to eliminate them because they're the devil they're the devil and you cannot deal with the devil\n\nWill the sixty to eighty percent of this country stand up\nThey never ever have they never ever have\nIt was twenty percent twenty percent for the American revolution\nKid how twisted this life has become yeah and also seems like by all uh understanding of him right now she was just an utter failure in life right for a million other reasons but I mean I don't feel\nHe's getting absolutely when he deserves it absolutely but I you could I could see what you're saying there\nYeah he was just I mean he was he was a you know a a a misfit his entire life I mean he's he is the quintessential example of a guy who goes out and kills he's he's mad at society because he's never felt like he his fit in\nAnd look how the press just they do they made this into Donald Trump made this ended\nDonald Trump so that one is at least you can draw a line from the idea that he is not that he was at the rally it's not a ... you know fault or anything but like at least he was a Trump supporter but\nThe guy who did the shooting at the at the synagogue they're trying to do the same thing he outwardly hated Trump outwardly hated him\nHe posted on social media about how he was really just assisting the Jews or that he did that people thought he talked to a good game but in reality he was helping Jews and I and we need to stop it he hated the guy he don't try to turn it into his\nWife a giants cartoon safe fell on Donald Trump today and he was removed from the earth mhm\nDo all these problems would still exist this is not Donald Trump Donald Trump is a symptom there is a sickness in our society\nOur political system is nothing more than a reflection of us and people are alone they're tired they're afraid they don't want to be stuck in the middle between two parties that are blaming each other for everything or blaming\nThem you know why America is a little upset right now they're tired of being blamed they're out here Boston\nTheir ass they're out here working every single day trying to raise their kids trying to figure out how to navigate and keep their children safe while in prison system called school that is teaching\n... and and doing everything that most parents believe they come home they're tired they\nDon't know how to solve it they're overwhelmed\nSociety is just pouring into their house with with the media and social media [noise] and then they have to sit and they have to watch people screaming at each other on TV\nAnd there's nobody actually answering questions there's nobody actually offering a solution none of these things anybody is talking about is the solution\nIs just blame the other side and most Americans are tired of it because they're the ones getting blamed they're the\nOnes that are racist they're the ones that are massage and ... they're the ones excuse me\nWere just out of here in Boston are asked trying to make a living while you freaks\nAre limited high on the hog on our tax dollars\nI'm Sorry but the the\nWhat's happening in our society is a symptom\nWe are unfortunately sick\nFifty [noise]\nFox News some Chris foster federal prosecutors in Pittsburgh of taking steps to seek the death penalty against Robert Ballard he's the man accused of killing eleven people wounding six at a synagogue Saturday\nAt an interfaith vigil last night many express sympathy our hearts\nFor out all those who lost loved ones into those still fighting for their lives\nThan ours posted anti Semitic messages on social media just minutes before the attack and later told investigators he quote wanted to kill Jews he has hospitalized after being shot by police Fox\nIs Tanya Jay powers uncle and Merkel says she'll step down as her party's leader but stay on his Germany's chancellor\nHer opponents have replacing Harris chairwoman could be a possible step toward replacing her is chancellor her Christian Democratic party won with disappointing results in a key region and Sunday state election boxes living with this is Fox News [noise]\nEleven [noise]\nWe welcome to the program Mr a patch gray a hello pat how are you ... that was a good how's your weekend a it was a it was not great ... why why not\nIt was a you know a bad football games uh experiences everywhere I went\nAh what do you do any of your experience everywhere you know you're not having a hard time talking I'm speaking true\nYou know that would do the easiest thing in the world right now sure sure it is sure it is\nThis uh this weekend a I had a really I really had a difficult time uh I mean I just did you guys watching the news all this week you know\nAs little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause it's like I get the updates but yeah\nYeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore yeah\nI I never watch cable news never mind the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews can't or oh the N n my heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you don't want to lose I don't know who's doing that they do I really don't know who's your\nFans watch Fox you know 'cause uh it's a safe haven mostly unless you're watching Shepard Smith\nUh [laughter] but it's always been that way but I don't know I'm just CNN\nI don't know who does 'cause that's\nOn ... it's the people who hate Trump ... yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly out\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to them talk about early do down the synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's ... Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of bird dog we've got a\nBuddy who he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today's the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning senator and a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life he yeah\nIt's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise] this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well what\nWhat what part of of that do you think this is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter\nA outwardly heated Donald Trump\nWas not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or as long as you that don't tie him to it yet but you do more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that their overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment\nBut again has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that\nWere telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your\nWife well we don't want us we don't blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the Republican paint on was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they they had a very balanced view of that one for a understood that individuals who are responsible\nFor their own actions that time that's right he understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes we can sit there and both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know that when I'm never going to end on that one\nIn fact repeated it consistently gets repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was\nYou know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nThank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on day you\nKnow we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really are you a free tickets but seriously you know now all of sudden you're interested maybe can change that I get you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you or what it is it's Sunday\nA legally might get Sunday yes or it's going back to ... tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about like a a stuff you were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the ... turned\nCompletely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy answer does ...\nAnd up Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the proceeds from the I'm from the event and um\nWe're giving them to I'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to the uh the refugee um oh yeah a group I'm not sure we are going to give 'em to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um to a a local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the the synagogue and I'm not sure the nonsense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember and you came back after this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example of ... supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard that was shot by somebody national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented\nBy the the prime minister of Israel though\nThat well that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed it's not a big one so\nIt's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite it's completely insane if you are a ... a conservative and I the\nThe people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them will criticized George Soros but they criticize him because he's a liberal as progressive policies he supports a policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him if I wanted him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he is a very shady history\nOr around the world that but anti Semite teacher ... to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew the same way they don't like fish Shapiro\nBecause you're in front of a hero party the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx\nHe was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew now but because he came up with the idea of communism I I'm not a fan no not a fan of\nFat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized venue Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know lays hand on the night it's not all understand that they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest finance here's the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism from liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\n... it's just not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinion because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is if you try to make these into cartoon arguments\nWhich is such a a ... ... again this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say\nIt anyway because they don't care\nThat is that that is exactly what they think they claimed to be against and they do it every day wow\nI didn't hear a solution there is to\nGo to a battering I don't know what I advocate for it and uh we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about um [noise] buying or selling a home if you are if you're buying a home right now or you're thinking about it do it now get the low interest rate right now if you have to refinance your loan\nDo it right now do it now\nI'm home equity is at an all time high homeowners are starting to\nWell I mean that's not something that Simpsons signed on for yeah sorry\nTwice and I believe all\nRaised and this is a great lesson for everyone who tries to please save Megan Kelly I think the same type of thing right you can't you can't no matter what you say they're never going to be pleased the people who come after you for these these nonsensical PC issues\nWill never be please no matter what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter ... they're not asking you to remove up who they're not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them any earlier you realize that the better\n[noise]\nLet me change the subject to enough is enough when America will enough be enough\nNew polls Americans fed up\nCrave unity admitted violence now\nThis one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party they want unity that number is even higher but I'm not sure people actually mean this I'm not sure what unity even means\nThey say that we no longer really um agree on the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values but what are those core values\nAnybody know what\nAre the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now\nWay things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied Thirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent\nFifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is what are those values\nSincerely what are we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value\nUm moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple I those aren't values those are issues that's a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage we have a few things we have\nTo decide we have to decide one is the western world worth saving his freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes\nOr no and I don't want you just to you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this why is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case that their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place\nWe have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half\nThe country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are we sincerely which are we we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice is in it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one no\nNo you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe'd been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America\nAnd not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\nWhy is the constitution were fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on\n\nI I'm I we cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line\nLike climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value\nThat's not climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion and ... in the scientific field\nYou give me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nNo actually no we couldn't fight on all of the friends we had to choose we didn't even want to go save Europe American didn't even want to go into war\nCould you\nOh my gosh how could you bitch Europe [noise] wait a minute\nWe're supposed to go save the white patriarchy where ... wait a minute were to blame for all of that because we didn't go in and save the white hierarchy I thought you just said that was bad and should be destroyed\nIs America bad or good let's have that discussion I'm\nFox News on Chris foster the man accused of killing a lemon people at a synagogue in\nPittsburgh Saturday Robert Bowers as his first court appearance today very ... says he hid in the dark storage closet with some other people and called nine one one man who walked out was killed and then our stepped in\nI could see that he looked around only because there was a shaft of light as he opened the door stepped over males body than pay any attention step back and walked out\nSix people including for police officers were wounded in the attack the suspect was shot and wounded by police human remains and records have been found after a plane crash just after takeoff in Indonesia\nA Boeing seven thirty seven from low cost carrier lion air plunging five thousand feet into the sea a short while after taking off from Indonesia's capital officials say likely killing all one hundred eighty nine on the flight headed for an island chain\nOff in my tracks Fox has ... this is Fox News [noise]\nFifty [noise]\n...\nAddress the before\nWe when we get off the air today there's so much to talk about um we've got to talk about Twitter and what they're doing now 'cause it it brings it brings the point that I was just making\nHome about what our values and what are the problems that we're trying to solve their different\nPeople are now saying that you know the problem is is that Americans don't agree on basic values and principles anymore well I agree with that but nobody even is talking about those when's the last time you heard anyone really talking about values or principles in the mainstream media\nTell me last time you heard that talked about on Fox or on CNN or MSNBC tell me\n\nDefending basic principles what are those principles well American principles\nWe used to find self evident that all men are created equal so you want to talk about the uh the the shooting\nIn I'm In er\nPittsburgh great\nThat guy has violated American principles all men are created equal an endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights one of those rights is religious their right to to pursue God the way they pursue God\n\nNow how about the principal violated or by the bomber\nCrazy guy crazy guy wow\nAll men are created equal and dug by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these\nFreedom of speech freedom of expression freedom of assembly freedom to petition your government well I don't like what those Democrats are saying I don't like what the media is saying but they have a right to say it\nSo do you target them for death not if you want to talk about principles everything else\nIs about politics now we could talk about his mental health and that would be something else that would be a very valid target the topic we got to talk about mental mental health in America Americans are feeling more and more alone more and more isolated communication is going through the roof\nBut none of those are principles\n\nDo we take care of one another well that's the golden rule isn't it\nThat's the golden rule\nSee we we just assume that\nAnd we were awake for a while and I I'm not sure if we are as wake as we think we are now\nWe woke up and we we really um we really learned a I think under Brock Obama but now many of us have gone back to sleep because okay our aside is in charge and so they don't take care of it no no they won't that is the problem no they won't\nWe are the answer they are not the answer we are the answer\nAnd you're not going to learn this through osmosis\nFound an incredible thing happened to me my my son finally got into American history and I couldn't wait to get out okay he's got a full and there's going to be the easiest thing ever American history living in my house go into my speech is listening to me\nYou know helping me pack things up for a speech is you know all of these rare documents going with me and being in the museum going through the museum even even giving a tours in the museum\nI thought this is going to be easy nope constitution nope\nDeclaration of independence

I'm Dave Anthony Fox News intercepted this morning in Atlanta address the CNN this\nAnd of course you know these campaigns like it because it gives them a chance because I'm so many chances to get people to go and get people to to the polls and force them to go early to get all the activists out and they could have them\nGo and you know bill pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're I mean they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day but there's one interesting way of looking at this we talked to a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then changed to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that if people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton\nAnd there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if it's Thirteen district that voted for Mitt Romney in two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand sixteen so two thousand twelve on average squirting FiveThirtyEight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nIn two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nAre we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states\nSo if you look at it kind of took to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate into two thousand sixteen but a big big move\nFrom two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correct team now there were Twenty one district that voted for Barack Obama\nAnd then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one or so in two thousand twelve with rock Obama they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nOr in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs it you would think of these real swing districts so far polling you're showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points that's big the big change so now ... that's almost equal to where they were voting and brown around ... time\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switch to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Obama\nWith Romney or people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton\nThat's where these a district show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for oh Brock Obama then change to Trump in the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama in those states in the Trump election there is about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats and it was you know now that part of that it's it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWhere this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania is a good example of that where they have just a big lead\nOr not because I don't think it's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers have a ... tell me when all this means from last week\nOr the Democrats making is is the momentum started just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't take much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now wait till it seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid and the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all are due to the shooting in the bombing\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you want real polling reaction that lethal today so you'd have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday at the early okay we'll look for that\n[noise] the election by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend or as you know a gunman opened fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh he shot and killed eleven people during Sabbath services injured six others for where police officers\n\nThe guy was insane\nHe hated Donald Trump that doesn't make him a Democrat doesn't mean that he was\nYou know following I dunno Cory Booker whoever it just means this is not political\nAnd should it be keep jumping to politics first\nI Can't imagine what these families are going through\n\nPennsylvania has taught us before with the Amish how to deal with killers\n\n[noise] if you've been listening to me [noise] um for a long time you know what I Believe is coming and have said is coming for a while and I'm always wrong with timing\nBut I don't think there's any way to deny that what I've worn was coming is here now we're seeing the beginnings of it now\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's going to get harder it's going to get harder for you to stand up\nHave they taken gab down yet I think the\n... the service provider for them has taken them down um I don't know if they're back up as Afghans fault gathered that it's kind of a shorter\nCompetitor I guess I Would say that they wound up are\nBecoming a safe haven for anti Semite so I guess and and and you know\nI don't want that nobody wants that but we either believe in freedom or we don't and yes I don't I don't like the poison that they put out\n\nBut I also don't like the silencing of voices this America man this is American principles you can't silence voices\n\nSky was a deeply disturbed really bad guy\n\nYou know you watch TV and you see the victims the faces growling across the TV screens\n\nAnd you might think that things are getting worse\n\nAnd I guess historically speaking this is the worst anti Semitic shooting we've ever had in the history of our country eleven people\n\n[noise] on the positive side that's nothing compared to some countries\n\nI saw some reporters say you know the problem is a this is Donald Trump I Hope you I Hope you're happy that you have your uh your synagogue or I'm Sorry your ah your embassy in Jerusalem really really that's where you're going\nReally this was caused by moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nOh my gosh [noise] wow\n\nYeah Jews were killed in Israel like terrorists\nLast year a hundred and twenty two hundred and twenty two is that Donald Trump's fault too was that just the evil juice full how many of France\n\nFrance they are moving out at a record number because they know

TV we hearing voice when you're struggling a bit more than ... than usual okay yeah\nMy my my advice is make it tangible because there's so many of us that tune in every day and and listening to this broadcast but then we don't make a tangible and even you were saying that you haven't been doing your shows you haven't been out of the road for a while I think it's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people you agree\nMy friend and I generally of I had a a friend of mine that's a Vietnam veteran in his seventies and we went all the way we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at two AM stroke six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday now\nAnd and then stood for eleven hours straight because we were told the first two thousand people in line would get into the hangar\nAnd we knew we were going to get that way and and as it got through security and looking at George saying oh I Can't wait to sit down and you get to the hanger and there were no states so there's a reality of we're going to be standing another six hours\nOn concrete so when I was saying is this president is a lawyer I'm Sorry I just play just playing the recited go ahead tell us or\nI could say it as much as they want you know what we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale a solidarity network which was a socialist group\nThat was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake breakfast before they came to protest and you know we we were joking well do you think there were a vegan and gluten free options to go along with that and right but\nThere were over ten thousand people there for the rally unless they Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of how would you say this about your ... functions when you've had the restoring functions\nThere was no garbage we you would never know when there was ten thousand people there you know one was complaining I was a kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I tend to get to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down\nNo people were so open about talking and you know someone had to go to the bathroom ... their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child well well you you run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment\nAnd you know it's like a president just happened to show up [laughter] it was I and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois\nBecause I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt whether the president was going to show up or not\nAnd this was after we got in the hangar we'd been standing there for two hours but we never gave up hope and we were we we all know we had jokes of you know conservatives the one thing that liberals can do better than us is chant we can't can't as many classes or something\nYou know we saw it and I'm really glad we saw [laughter]\nBut you know it's it was such a positive environment and our legs were or just killing us by the time that he got there\nAnd George not drove back that night it was at twenty eight our road trip that we took for this experience and as exhausted as we were in as much as we were a gang\nGeorge looks at me and says he's doing one in Missouri later this week is and they how far is that well that was that what it was just six hours Missouri was going to be eight but we were going to go until we found out that this one was going to happen right across the river on friday so fight like it tangible ... that's the best thing I can say is go and meet these other people\nTend to Seventy five ... they were very quiet people but we do cut to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realized we can be there's hope for society\nYeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot and you're like well yup on how\nAlison hang on the second I I Want to get your copy of my book I I signed it I'll send it up to you thank you so much\nFor holding him thanks for I'm I'm sharing that it is that that is but maybe if I might struggling today\nDo feel like I'm struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling today I'm I'm a little frustrated at the new nation I Would say yeah and I am able I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what you're saying\nHere um let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president I'm being an anti Semite she's his daughter is Jewish but uh you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively few", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck
