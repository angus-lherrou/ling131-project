V. in your house in Nineteen forty seven you were a Rockefeller\nTVs were of harder to find than cars in this country and TV signals weren't exactly what they are today either so true and doing this first broadcast yeah I'm sure it is historic and all that but\nMany more people heard it on the radio than watch it on TV that day and what was Truman talking about what was so important that he had to do a national broadcast\nHarry Truman was appealing for Americans to cut back\nOn grain you use in order to help the starving people in Europe this was post World war two and while we were the bread basket for the world uh Europe was starving and Truman said look we got to cut back a little bit so we can be the benevolent leaders in the world\nAnd now if you fast forward sixty Seventy years\nAmerica's not the leader and wheat production anymore yeah we still do well but thank God a lot of other countries are starting to become self sufficient but that's what that speech was about on this date in Nineteen forty seven also in uh Nineteen Ninety One\nIf you're a Mark Wahlberg fan you probably and you're you're my age you might remember this on this day Nineteen Ninety One Mark Wahlberg at the time known is Marcie mark and the funky bunch had the number one pop it in the country\nWith something called good vibrations not the beach boys song it's more of a dance track with Mark Wahlberg wrapping over it\nAnd now Mark Wahlberg is a massive box office star and how did he get there how did he go from being a\nA an underwear model and with the funky bunch doing good vibrations to one of the biggest stars on the silver screen well if you've ever read Mark Wahlberg daily routine you understand\nHe gets up at three thirty in the morning and he does two things for half an hour each every morning he prays yes he praised for half an hour in the works out for half an hour he works out like three or four different times a day\nHe also spent time with this kid's he works and he goes to bed at seven thirty so while he is up at an ungodly hour three thirty in the morning he also is in bed very early\nAnd ah one more little note here on this day apple computer the founder of apple computer Steve Jobs passed away the age of fifty six in two thousand eleven he's been dead for seven years pancreatic cancer got Steve Jobs and I use my apple computer\nAll the time to go on social media\nWhich reminds me I have to say thank you to one of the sponsors of this show is nippy dot com\nYou know to non are privileged to to be on TALK radio and share thoughts with you about things that matter to us as Americans every day\nAnd your opinion matters to that's why I Am thrilled to tell you about a new social media site nippy dot com if you're frustrated with the discourse on social media pages you don't like being censored\nThe charges are upsetting a and and uh they're obviously they've triggered an entire national conversation about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are treated in this country at the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence\nFor any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story that is the story and I for one I for\nOne we'll not condemn Ford and I will not condemn a a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to confirm and we need to stop the witch hunts [noise]\nNeither listening to blame that probably am so [noise]\nIn my book addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of of why we should really be talking about something entirely different why we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true in the middle chapter of the the book I I ask\nThis question is this worth saving nobody is asking this\nWe're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking the question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both\nBut is it on the on the whole has it helped more people or hurt more people were\nNot having that conversation we are having it now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing month [laughter] how're you doing\nI'm I I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not to talk about\nWhat capitalism a and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't come at this with politics in mind\nNo I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we are talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show\nAnd and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about\nThe Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nA mute on humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean you're going to ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying them all filed ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knock on the night there's going to be no jak outta thug nobody's going to take you off to prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars it completely unfit\nSo ... right now I ... you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of\nFreedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense yeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise]\nMy my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in ... and I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believes\nAnd their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works while you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters I found that there was one system of pulled people up to billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur ... I don't know if you have him off the top of your head\nTo toe absolute so from Nineteen Seventy and killed today you know when when you when I were\nReally little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on it was really in the seventies when people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old and Nineteen eighty three is starving children it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been ever advocate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page of the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a new story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is it two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of storage little poverty Glenn since you and our\nKids and there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter you know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it\nAs Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are ... are wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's corrupt now would you agree with that\nYeah that's it well it's because the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state Capitol around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people so she'll competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas factor that you know the the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a frame democratic nation is very very important [noise]\nAnybody wants to shut down and competition on behalf of powerful people\nIs not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas to compete means to do it better than the other guy barely peacefully and respectfully to win over an audience and that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nKept a bunch of wealth and the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through crony capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a those basically to system of wired deals you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more or whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward\nPeople that are at the bottom non so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like stretching out potatoes\nSome ways they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system that make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle [laughter]\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university is four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American tech\nAnd why can't they rise they can't rise because we have a discriminatory system unequal education were poor kids or or locked into public education system of their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers [laughter] we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate educational reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college for people actually do work skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America\nWhere white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills in Portland issue without going to college\nAmazing are there that it's it's that the early I think of apprenticeships that I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens time since we've seen it it's amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies back with more Arthur Brooks and is America worth saving that Mm\n[noise] [noise]\nFox News I'm Karen McHugh judge Brett Kavanaugh will likely have a title changed by the end of the weekend we expect\nA cabin ought to be confirmed on the Supreme Court sometime in the late afternoon on Saturday he would probably be sworn in over the weekend and be ready for business or at the high court on Monday\nThe vote comes after two undecided senators announced they support the nominee Senator Lisa Murkowski is the only Republican to break ranks after a week long Manhattan tendency fugitive Kirby Wallace is in custody Henry county sheriff Monti blue says the accused killer was found with a loaded gun we're very fortunate\nThat we didn't wind up in in a a a shootout with us make up their uh it crossed his mind because he told us it crosses mine uh he just thought that we had the drop on a so he didn't he didn't take that actually this is Fox News [noise]\nClaim back probably\nRight at mid term so I'm going out ah for a a tour this is going to be a blast needed October twenty fifth in San Antonio Houston the twenty six Dallas the twenty seventh then November first enrichment\nHershey on the second November third is Pittsburgh then I think we go up to Cleveland than the election happens oh is this going to be fun\nOh man right before the election and just after the election plus a chance to get all the madness\nA off your shoulders for a night and just have some fun\nYeah it's gonna be great great fun to make sure you grab your tickets addicted to outrage or it starts in about a month grab your tickets now wherever tickets are sold you can find out more details if I'm coming towards you know Glenn Beck dot com slash tour I'd love to see it\nSeems like the the last uh the last ... we did was serious wasn't it the one here in Dallas Cowboy stadium yeah I think so and so the last bond comedy tour was\nTwo thousand nine or two thousand and it was all but it's been ... cents I bet it was common sense yeah yeah it's been a long time so this is lots of fun joined us\nGrab your tickets now Glenn Beck dot com slash to her okay back with a Arthur C Brooks he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute Arthur though the ...\nWho is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good none of this is good\nUm yeah however ... we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has got a ride because we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is he's got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden is it\nKnow it is on and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill of rights by constitution guys like Glenn Beck you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and throwing good the big problem as there are too many people\nThe media and politics and entertainment and aren't ... campus shows on the right and the left\nCorner ... dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other I mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us\nPolitically that's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we love we just have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have\nTo hate it when there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful by trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talk about\nThe things that really bring us together and then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich\nBy by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time their way not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears\nThat's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive and to say their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective the moral object to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want is a social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it and then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history\nIt's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nYeah so I just this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring and part of it is actually filmed in Denmark in Denmark is considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a it's a social democracy it has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government\nWith the ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the one that's in the middle where we're effectively being held hostage we want better than us in this country we we don't have to back down from conservative at all [noise] we just have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellent you know your message has always been so good pled because you don't hate anybody and we have to\nAs leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on

immediately immediately somebody's even bluffing at the table I've got this they fold they don't want to fight they're not willing to fight\nDonald Trump allowed this to happen and that Kavanaugh would have been completely discredited I think under any other president he would have just gone away discredited because they would have said you know what it's not worth it we don't believe those charges and he would have had no platform to defend themselves ...\nDonald Trump is there one thing to say about him he is a fighter he does not give up and uh you know sometimes that's good sometimes that's bad it was very good\nBecause I Can't think of any other president in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan that\nWould have stood for this and would have stood against it\nYou know I Know I the heat surprises me a on a pretty regular basis and I guess I should be used to it by now but um you\nKnow that's why that's why people voted for him yeah for for this very reason he's willing to ... he's willing to stand in make despite because he believes in it\nAnd it's ... it's just nothing I really didn't think he had it in him yeah you know we've talked about before\nYou've got to admit when you're wrong and here's another case of me being wrong and I I Will tell you I think this guy is such a solid citizen at least from what I Know that I don't think he would ever do this but boy oh boy Democrats\nI Would hate to see your case come up against the Bream court with him and if you're Feinstein and New York you're battling and\nGood luck to you yeah he is a solid citizen and we'll be

up is well a Twitter you get a kick her off are you going to kick her off\nIf this is and if this if this isn't the epitome of threats I don't know what is what she really typified the [noise] the insanity that has overtaken the left\nNo amount of evidence in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind\nAnd you know what I I I really\nI can understand how you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed with this on ending hatred and there's nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it you're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yet no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't

think they were great men they were just flawed\n\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because

to their neighbors when you go down that road you always always end up killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying we should feed their genitals to the pigs\nTell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric and what a surprise once again it's coming from the elites in the

listen to any message if we are just hurling insults\nIf we are fighting fire with fire it will change no one's mind if you don't believe me how many minds did we change\nDid we change the course\nOf two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monster is saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that\nBut because of that which we don't necessarily have this time\nThe media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right\nSo what's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them\nIt's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you were crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way and as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election\nI was wrong on multiple occasions but what amazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish\nOf the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump OK mhm\nThe only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it'll be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while she says yeah that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabbit about\nGuy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I was willing to\nDie in a sword for em em remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he asked them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next a nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know that that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion\nRight there at the time and place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the polls if\nIf you put a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nAnd ... and ... versus Wade was a terrible decision you\nThen have\nRepublicans running to the polls and you'll also have Democrats but I think that your best case scenario get flake or ...\n\nConfirmed judge Brett Kavanaugh as the ninth justice on the Supreme Court appears to be a slam dunk\nCautious optimism is certainly the order of the day assuming no last minute defections judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed for the Supreme Court later this afternoon the president saying he was very proud of the U.S Senate from voting yes to advance the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh Fox is\nKevin ... at the White House and we check the calendar lately election day is nearly year\nPresident Trump will be on the minds of many Americans when they decide mid term elections now a month away campaigning in Mississippi this week the president encourage supporters to pretend he's on the ballot\nRepublican on the white\nHouse and then a pain by the a P warns that Republican candidates he tried to distance themselves from the president arguing themselves harm in the mid term election\nFox's Rachel Sutherland reporting this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise] Mm [noise] Mm\n[noise] ...\nAnd the Glenn ... All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin ... which ... I'm\nSo we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you that's up in the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like a judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general would wait one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's just a certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman a he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the capital case in the house in case of the cabinet case happens ah thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference ...\nA professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between forward and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course like ... ... words case\nThey both have a notes from there do they do get around those cases at the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kevin ...\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things one\nHas notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually\nMeeting me yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case if you have a woman who has photos of the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course\nA Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key thousands a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax um writings um pictures and are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real\nTired real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually yeah adviser Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at\nThat time yeah but but but lives and I mean you I mean you don't have video tape ...\nTape now we haven't seen it yet though ha ha now there is allegedly videotape that exists somehow ah one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet\nOf course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be\nThe thing that we have to take her word that there is video with the with the veil and ...\nAnd we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the four case so we have we have come out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alice in case the

[laughter]\nIt is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical

the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yes it ... I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him in the film is saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's monitor has always been there are more than just a company to make money or they have a certain the east coast is sort of the world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about paying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy is not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's get can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how for instance you know there's there's um a\n... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seeing that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein or have science a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nGoogle is a Google is a verb but now they are not a noun verb auto Google it yes well I'm from Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's a crime that real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about five\nOr about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and there's debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story the point is is out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton\nThat fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you to vote a different\nWay that wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people the Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you not I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer\nTheir answer on why they won't make it transparent yes\nAnd it's not very good [laughter] no\nNo it's not the name of the documentary is the creepy line the review line dot com Peters whites are is with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\n[noise]\nNews I'm Karen McHugh the Senate votes later today the most likely confirmed Brett Kavanaugh as the next Supreme Court justice the president just please\nStay with Brett Kavanaugh or ...
