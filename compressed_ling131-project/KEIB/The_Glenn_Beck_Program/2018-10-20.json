S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they have the ability\nTo shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs\nOr around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results have felt like a news story that just stays there for people to look at it's generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays a in\nWorld War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the\nThis is the system that they would have dreamt of\nFor propaganda [laughter] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift millions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA\nThat's just one of ten ways\nAre that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm sending seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these the effects that ... that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen uh working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using a the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system itself was that first ever created\nAnd so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who my favorite by the way as you mentioned a in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty blatant that's\nPretty extreme wow or sees leaks these leaks that\nWe've seen recently from Google a you know they're they're they count as you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them\nAnd uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents\nTo try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually be able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know ... we well I Wish we could be fully up and running and time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which Glenn\nIn but I Am I in trouble [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm ...

[laughter] this is this has been asking that for a second it will come back with the bad news plus\nThe the I think he's in ten different ways that Google is influencing us and not just Google but

hit the news and the Washington Post\nA you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so I have these amazing screen shots that\nThey're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have to screen shot showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay um let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was it was the seven ten ten of these that you're\nFollowing there's ten altogether okay out an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when we came here we go this is called the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split will buy one having any idea that they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh\nOkay we're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to\nDo about it you

on the ... were act mind control or the threshold of mind control doctor\n[noise] [noise] ah well we've been there for a long time so there's a you know uh there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than two point five billion people soon to be over four billion\nA whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences\nAre are affected a dramatically uh every single day by a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that's that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that you did a study during the last presidential election\nYou are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were doing a a a a study on Google Search results and found that they were\nTrying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way we then have the search suggestion of fact now target messaging affect\nWhat is the target a surcharge ... sure targeted messaging T I may recall that is a these are all things\nThe study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect\nIs really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen\nIs is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly to supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional\nFour hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I I don't I I don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not\nI'm a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if it's something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course\nIs ends at what targeted advertising is all about but you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive ...\nI mean this is so dangerous um and it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envision forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise]\nOh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and\nYou name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're absolutely right they have literally unprecedented\nPower or to ... ... is shifts to people yes shift unstable people's shift anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power\nUh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledge or you want to get create doubt [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape humankind\nI it's hard to tell I'm a I'm going to have to say probably not because\nIt's it's very very hard uh you know Google and Facebook meticulous are are are so powerful and so imbedded that you just ... ... you can't really cut into them people people don't want to leave them people are ... you know they they love them\nAnd so it's hard you know I Know lots of people working on alternative kinds of you know services and\nA and a lot of people are talking about block chain and so on but I mean the reality is you know we're talking about Ninety percent of search around the world is done on Google\nUh these two companies are serving right now more than two point five billion people that'll be pass four billion within the next three years they're just growing and growing and\nGrowing and found so it's going earning what they're doing in China\nI mean I mean I don't know how I don't know how they sleep at night\n[noise] [noise] well that's outrageous that is ... because they're actually they're actually partnering with the Chinese government to participate in the Chinese government's ah aggressive\nA program to control all of its citizens and Google is ... ... and that I mean literally making it easier and better\nMaking that kind of the easier and better that's ... that's that's outrageous\nDoctor I Would I Would love to fly you in and spend a couple of hours with you and and have you on regularly to to be able to monitor and help in any way that we can to get the word out this is\nThis is the thing that I think America and the world should be concentrating on and no one's talking about it the world is being redesigned by a handful and we're just not aware of it and it's going to change overnight\nA doctor thank you so much I really appreciate\nIt absolutely you bet it's been an honor true out or Glenn\nThanks very much Dr Robert ...

fairly low are very low um reviews standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned a lot of fun it was really fun fun right hum he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we\nTook the criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope\nPeople continue to address it a secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest\nRanks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out in the middle that we were wrong but it it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our problem is\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year or to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out and to the public eye took\nMaybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week um my two collaborators worked also very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell and the other day\nYou know a so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers of typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard and we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work\nThere was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this\nBut this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for ten years there's a research component to that depends

paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and\nSo we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been cut short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on

we've put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and lay out so well what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean\nYou got me man [laughter]\nI thought it was done in the privacy of a a veterinary office [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nBut but the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is display politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pet phobic as they call it\nAnd that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who we claimed wrote that paper and he actually has a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of all areas\nBecause that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean this kind of a this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on merit not on who did it and so\nA lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in effect which was very common names on purpose I actually used a a a I roll dice to pick a fight off of a list of\nMost common names for certain years and the way that would blend in with lots of people\nOkay hang on hang on I got to take another breaking it will come back in and finish up why ... why you thought that was important in and go through some of the\nThe other studies are back in the back and just as a\nThe handmade no winner and the billion dollar mega millions drawing so it rolls over for one point

T. v.'s Fox News [noise]\nI haven't seen the Glenn Beck Taliban\nWere talking to a doctor James Lindsey author of life in light of death or he is a you can follow him at consensual a conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the the if not the mastermind behind a the\nA papers a of record that were were being written\nA for for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critique to no way that most people would um just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey judge it says this is a start says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce they're determined how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged few are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in brief privilege\nClassroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this\nSet of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence teams and they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil and that's\nThe worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of be a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the depth of the scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that you would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim to for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um but the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over him interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would would [noise] what's that mean\nSo all these answers a really complicated I'm\nWill be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this\nHer classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice side or the fields topics courses I guess is the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nYou have responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you know or left wing people who want to ... to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially\nUm we're all kinds of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to protect all attacks and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media is here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\nReally remember you know you're an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details and I really hope that you know that our project kind of reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally does I I Am I I hate to say that too I'm Out of time it could I invite you to come down and uh and do a pod cast with me you know we spend an hour

break out these were changed completely uh you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape to control the

healthcare\nSingle payer and I'm Sorry single payer health care free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger\nA infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supportive now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way it will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's gonna be a lot more than I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nIt does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them are co sponsors of the bill or it\nSeems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racists for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYou know we were scare mongers and racist for saying yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but I just\nWant to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\n... no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college\nWe are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose taxes and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it'll be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right\nI'm old enough to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump sports that for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a\nThere's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean that that you know it'd be which have been that wants that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nTo run themselves in the cities can run whatever they wanted them and the rural areas can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand taking any of my former friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's ... by\nThe house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the head out\nRight you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things could be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator bronco bottle is senator I shouldn't care about\nThat because they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWould wait until they see this is the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed or you just\nArguing for king right with these the several stories in a row the MIT give you the argument for a king\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife and saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and\nThis Swiss army knife has failed\nOr no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure part right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ...\nThe Portland mayor ah refused to
