issues on social media it's not\nAbout politics and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump that can be about repealing the national anthem that can be about something that a celebrity status and an amplified in sort of turned up to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that's by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or ... puppet accounts\nYou were talking about a moving target people who are the leading their accounts changing their information making new accounts staying active so that they can actually be tracks to em given location and if Morton ... researcher at USC could prove definitively\nThese are Russian agents than he should be working at the CIA but he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned is what behaviors do they engage in debate speak in all caps what words do they use and then as they are out there the next week when you look them up again\nThese are sort of things that you look for when you're talking about foreign influence on line and it might be rushing that might be the Chinese it might be Iranians or it might be some flirting with a bone to pick with the rest of the country\nBut that's so what did they landed limit what did they plan to into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen accounts acted specifically be rushing

com slash touring\nSo if a critter used to be this ah this this system that you could um you know put the job that you were looking to fill and it would go out and it would post\nIt comes down to a lot of counter enlightenment philosophy it comes out this then at the fed up ... it's a kind of coming together as as an artistic and and hit us the ... and the artistic side of it that she really thought that we we don't have to worry about and\nAnti smoking as it may not it went it without being applied to\nSociety and we're starting to understand society as and they'd be constructed in systems of power and knowledge is a construct of the power that it comes from language that language\nIs dangerous because it constructs that reality that and that sort of the key ideas which at underlying the problem that with that we're seeing now\nNow you say that it doesn't have a ... that it's not saying worrisome in arts but I Would consider literature art as well and this is this is now how we are being taught that we have to read literature that uh we read it through the lens of oppression\nWhite male European oppression um even if the even if the author is saying no no that's not what the story is about but it's not\nThe author is not even the the last word on this is the the post modernist they can take and read that tax any way they want direct\nAbsolutely yes I mean I think that there's a slight confusion because that that probably ... to ... out of the cultural philosophical problem but I ... and look\nFor example would be a very different than it would be something that had made clear thought that it has an unending ... which is just the beginning of lots of stories which which doesn't add up that said that is a style that is all\nNight okay completely separate from voting Marlin stick thing\nAll right so you're saying as an artist you could create something that has no meaning um but it is only when it's used as a critique that it starts to get into trouble\nYes okay this is wonderful and they found and face as a place more than ... than not and the coach said than not the same purpose\nGreat okay um so tell me how it uh where it grew and and how it's grabbed us by the throat or university systems\nAt the uh the original slugging if they're just sitting at a smoker has very they pick right says in the late sixties ... as you all for Farley atop shack day or\nA ... and and they can in the health because and they came to get that or different this is an old saying that the same time at the same message\nThat they led ... with the ... they would ... with ... and ... with religion and institutions and they they thought that they can access to the big comfortable understanding of the things that I just pulled into pop ... comments\nOff the well was that the full of empire oh these these were crumbling and and that shifted decided to try to understand all the things that we saw with Tre\nActually trade the pace London is it safe to a new set of stuff because ever since he said\nThe reality is not something we find it's something that will make and make it in the status of power so it is powerful great\nWhich had decided for us what is truth and days and I understood that they are white heterosexual men and they should they should be um pick\nThat the fast paced letting us when they think it has taken a and political go they suddenly left is that they want to say that they were ... they wanted it to the whole thing with the power shed problems with it\nIt wasn't until the late eighties early nineties when a loss of and feminist and a critical a serious cliff they're sick that says that\nWe're taking everything about is is a little bit of well we need to deconstruct pay yes we need to see\nThat everything is socially constructed but we have to have some kind of reality if we're going to address anything we cannot for example address and ethics and they get winning unless we agree that women are saying that the next day it said is that the kinds of places so\nThere was a change had to bring back some kind of attack could reality and that was of age and power back then they analyzed ... studies subjectively from the perspective of experience\nAnd with the assumption that we are looking at a power imbalance in any interaction between the great\nOkay so let me let me let me go back and because I think people might be thinking why are we talking about post modernism how does it relate to my life\nThis I Believe is critical in it too if you don't understand this release to have a basic handle on it you don't know what you're fighting you don't know what's really happening you don't know who's behind a lot of this or what the theories are behind it\nUm so let me let me first say post modernism the modern world is the world that was created that chased out the dark ages it was the it's the world created by the enlightenment of of science and reason them period that empirical evidence\nUh and and even I mean that you when you hear people say mathematics is racist\nThis is because we're there trying to deconstruct anything that holds\nThe modern world together is that correct\nYes it that they they think that it has been constructed I'm saying that a lot of voices has been left out and\nThis relates somehow to a lot of knowledge is I think they have the problem with the idea that then irrational and I'm In ... I'm known ages is that the property of winning or run\nAt the white people yeah that that is that is how it works\nOK I'm going to take you before we move forward I Want to take you back one more a step\nI'm a I'm going to take a break and then we come back I'm like you to help me on this because it's my understanding that a dirt on fur coat or came over\nTo the United states that this was really kind of shaped in frustration from the Nineteen sixty eight Paris ah riots\nAnd in frustration that they're not going to be able to take this whole thing down unless they take it all down they got to take all the system's down they're not going to win through culture\nUm and then it was that it was actually a much more strategic in its I'm planting of a virus if you will and I'd love to hear your take on that if that's true or not when we come back we're we fell in love roads [noise]\nAnd we also have to ask her about\nThe greatest prank ever a they her into other scientist when\nAnd

these groups and this group and this group that they become the power um it it sounds like it's it's just not just the construction it is constructing something that is the authoritarian in nature\nUh and I want to go there and I also need to find out a little bit about the hoaxes\nThat Helen and to other scientists did who were just they were looking at these peer reviewed publications and

of things Ben from a polling we had over the last couple of days the polling since the cabin up thing has\nBeen really good for Republicans in the ... uh it looked really positive we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like I'm a real positive things have happened in ... red states\nWhere Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Ted Cruz going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou may you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so yeah the point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point um ah\nAh several polls showed cruise only up by one or two New York times doing something really really interesting in which you know normally you kind of see\nThe ... news no well I didn't do that or they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happened and then you will go after him right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the results that in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho's voting for who when you see the whole build slowly as you watch it it's addictive do watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I at one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is for him to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is a\nIs part of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but Cruz in that poll wound up up a nine points in that one and he seems to be honest when their eyes are open up a lead there again and I'm not surprised by it either out a surprise

[noise]\nA magical destruction across the Florida Panhandle I'm Dave Anthony Fox News homes are gone\nBusinesses are gone governor Rick Scott one of the towns obliterated Mexico beach ... focus\nA I liked it by these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation is that high employment I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still I on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what ...\nWhat good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly more people out of stocks and bonds because why not just rates rise and\nBonds are more attractive relatively than shocks I'm usually those effects of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we dollar shave real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but the other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to that says\nTo the set and and uh John John Powell why you take it a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring I tend\nI tend to think that he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just that's just the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment as we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I met an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation ... I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I met with Iraq I'm a I'm a ...\nThat's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but\nI did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um [noise] you know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I I my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively and prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't necessary I Am a little concerned by the way I Glenn about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like a quibbling a four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why has it gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just said okay why I'm a why did why why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\n[noise] you know about the price of the global\nReduction in supply as a result\nOf acts up online bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nWe'll probably still going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean everywhere you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just fear you know this the stock market is driven by fear and greed [laughter] that's true is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred\nI said to my wife I let's let's take some of these profits and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last\nPresident that I heard really take on the bed [laughter]\nWas Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when\nThe fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week I Know why the president is the chief executive officer of the country right he is the one who was supposed to help manage our economy he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't he speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct\nI I think there's a lot of a loved one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes so you mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally twenty percent\nMortgage interest rates that was all because of fed mistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in two\nThousand seven and they all United we keep thinking these people\nAre somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know\nLet me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nOr and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think isn't even what he really fundamentally believes that the Arabs are good\n[laughter] here's my view I talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I Know trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal or where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before that\nThe deal had to be seals candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and\nThis is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with that I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an electoral property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using on so I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nUh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction uh when it comes to China then I'll let\nMe challenge beyond that whenever I uh you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about that like if we can't trade with China we sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't they were ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy and Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that courage and saying look\nWe're not gonna give you unfettered access to our markets if you're not going\nTo play by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time is running who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market and you got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your a trade secret ... I mean we can't live with that is right I ... when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also warned believe they also weren't or bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you probably have a real insight on this uh the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs and these things going on of allies\nAre ... like Canada and ... as a way of negotiating and bring these contracts at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA two point oh type of situation well that happened but the steel parents are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nWell this is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum terrorists or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum 'cause you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto\nBut we've got six million other manufacturers\nWho use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was over at the end how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make a you know\nBudweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and you judge that's going on around the country our auto producers autos are more expensive because the steel towers so my point to Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of this so\nI disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good\nAnd uh I uh my focus sweat from everything going on around the world to what was going on in my house by household and uh it was a sorry it was a challenging a we were\nShe was she was born of ever first and she was in the hospital\nAnd so on so Easter\nAnd she came home and she added ... to ... and uh she was on oxygen and stuff like that but\nShe was home um I Am\nAnd a B and my wife we have between us we had three three daughters and we tried for about ten years and thought that ever happened and that are out of the blue wife calls me it says uh we'd had a conversation at a she told me that uh\nThat she was pregnant and uh it's I don't know I I sympathize with the the the gentleman you you were talking with um\nBecause I I still have moments where I Want to get angry and stuff but then I stop and take a step back a brave at this bank of like of a daughter you know\nSo did you think can do to get that gain hope or did you gain perspective\n[laughter] ah both again both a ... it's just I I had hoped because I Want I Want a better world for my daughter you know a\n... the great Jerome thank you for sharing that and thank you for um thanks for your honesty of emotion there um uh the the good thing is this what I tried to um impress and our caller yesterday after um hung up unfortunately was\nWe're weaning\nWe're winning commonsense is winning it doesn't feel like it but that's just because the power structure that you're used to\nIs no more and when you look at what's happened and you look at the Democrats saying the things that they're saying now that\nYou know Eric Eric Holder today the latest is you know when they go low we kick them\nThat that's that's not an American principle that's not the way we should be have I don't want that from our side I don't think people want it from their side new research shows ... percent of the American people feel the same way\nThat's a good plan were when that [noise]\nSee some Chris posture there is widespread devastation and the Florida Panhandle home after home blown apart in Mexico beach where hurricane Michael made landfall yesterday today the focus is search and rescue\nWe prayed that's already in

what the storm is centered now at least two people have died in the storm Chinese government says the case against young June shoe is made out of thin air\nShe was charged yesterday in Cincinnati, Ohio with attempting to steal trade secrets from American Aviation and aerospace companies persuading experts to travel to China asking them to give talks universities when the real purpose was to

housing crisis worse combination of housing advocates renters large and small businesses competing groups and veterans committee major funding from Blackstone poverty without the idea that whole thing of the Bronx river parkway and ... and they're holding\nThis is John ... president of the hour job as taxpayers association for over forty years we fought against unreasonable taxes that make it

would be no new taxes without voter approval now we finally have a chance to vote on these big tax hikes that make driving so expensive the repeal of that tax hike is on the ballot as proposition ... please vote yes on prop six repealing this unfair tax [noise]\n\n\nWe're more on Florida coming up in just a second can we take a look at a also the ah ah the election numbers I think it's about time we started getting you know your analysis do 'cause I Know you love stats and there's nobody better looking at the numbers than you\nThank you the polls are hitting and they're coming in fast and Ah yes there's a lot to ah to understand about where that's going to get into that I'm sure we start there or do you go to start with the some of the hurricane stuff\nUh well I don't know if I Want to talk to somebody who cannot agree with NBC News that people are not natural disasters these are man made disasters now\nSo it wasn't manmade that we want an entire decade basically without getting one hurricane hitting the let me ask you something about that sir yes uh\nWould you agree with me that over the last ten years in the last ten years ... we have seen a dramatic increase in hurricanes here in the United states since we dropped out of the Paris accords\nYes sir no sir in as a yes or no answer\n... you're saying has it gone from zero to two and the time that I mean since\nHe's been out of that ah ... I\nMean the trend is not increasing that we we have one year that had more than another year is that what you're trying\nBecause I'm asking you in the last ten years and have we seen a cup of these ... these so called natural disasters I Want us in the last couple\nOf years thank you for your question NBC yeah there has been an increase from all over the years ... very much [laughter] that journalism these days it is here's what the\nPCC says remember this is Al Gore's a favorite place to go for climate permission to this is what they say about hurricanes numerous studies toward the end beyond the fifth assessment report of the Irish ... a PC have reported\nA di di di di di\nGreasing trend in the global number of ... of tropical cyclones\nAnd or the global globally accumulated psychotic energy there's low confidence regarding cheated and global tropical cycle numbers under global warming over the past four decades there's consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trend in the global number of very intense cyclists the\nView and I may see see reports the latest the latest update\nTo bring out of a boring un talk what they're saying is total number of a hurricane's going down\nAnd there is low confidence in any change in the I'm In ... like what they say it's like well because they used to say there's going to be more frequent and intense hurricanes then they realized the frequency thing wasn't happening there it's going to be more intense they don't even have evidence of that and so\nMe Mr ... here is this not the strongest storm a it on record did that is hit the Florida Panhandle that is the reporting you sir I rest now here's the summary [laughter]\nAh the PCC once again reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes and tornadoes have increased much less increased due to a greenhouse gases that exactly the story you're getting on the media when they're trying to say we have ten years though we have real\nNudes is they've they've they've up to their commitment and in response I tell them\nUp yours and [laughter] so [laughter] ah [laughter] it is a pretty remarkable okay let me let me ask you this as we get into the poll numbers\n\nI Believe there is a chance we see a red wave because of Kavanaugh [noise] then we were concerned that there would be this massive blue blue wave in both the house and the Senate I think we see a red wave not a title wave but a red wave\nIt's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if\nIf the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now I like these things go away for example uh the the Access Hollywood tape happened right about this time in two thousand sixteen\nRight about now if you have to ... eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I uh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact on news ... I mean this stuff goes away fast and I think\nThere will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left it alone leclaire Williams but they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people I'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says when\nWhen they go low we kick them and the crowd cheers and this and he follows it with this is who the new Democratic Party is amazing amazing", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Los Angeles", "day": "11"}
