spook and this guy is can I say that any more oh my gosh my apologies to actual Halloween spook Z and to the CIA I Apologize\nI so I'm Jason is a guy who watches a international affairs for us and I am fascinated by this story of ... a from a from Saudi Arabia or and I want\nYou to bring me I Want you to bring me the news that no one in the news is reporting on this but let me bring everybody up to speed if you haven't been following this guy in a nutshell he worked for the Washington Post he's a revered revered reporter\nWhich makes me sip is suspicious immediately but he's a revered ... a reporter at Washington Post he is a Saudi citizen\nHe was over in Turkey he's going to get married and so he's like I Need my divorce papers from the embassy\nAnd so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy hours and hours and hours are going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out she calls the embassy and they say oh I\nKnow he left he left just the old he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside well I'm not sure if he went out on bail did he go out the front door yes so bill and the other guy mock\nMoods says yes he went out the front door well CCTV cameras show that he didn't ever leave the Saudi embassy at least by the front door so [noise] the next thing we find out this was yesterday as the Saudis um the Saudi prince lands of Gulf Stream\nHis gulfstream ... at the airport there I'm In turkey about an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty suitcases they piled up in the back of the vans they're driving to the embassy they decide for some reason or another they need more empty suitcases they buy some more empty suitcases they also stop just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed it at the embassy but they needed a bones\nSaw [laughter] by your bones saw well thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the ball and saw God only knows\nWhat they do in the embassy but they're seeing leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them into the back of the van they throw them on the jet and the jet takes off\nMeantime United States says we do have a we do have a an encrypted messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to in trapping or tried to trap and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia\nA and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have\nGiven to the United states or shown the United states this video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned and then tortured and then murdered\nWe don't know if that is true but that's the latest today so ...\nWe're going to find out who this guy is and was possibly ah when we come back because this is the part of this story no one\nSurely CNN and Christie on on a poor would want you to have this information will give that to your next [noise]\nLet me tell you about our Palm Beach letter seeking to Ari is crypto course Ninety seven percent of the people who take his crypto course give it a four or five star rating and these are people\nThat range from you know people like me I didn't get into crypto currency 'em at all because I thought I don't know any I listen to Warren Buffett a and Warren Buffett said\nUm I don't know how they're framing it he was friends he was he was ...\nHe loved the crown prince they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies and that's where they've ...\nWants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia basically that's the best way to put it for this guy but he's a he's not a good guy he wants to political Islam he wants to political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work at Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm On the other hand you have this one guy that's not that great of a guy you've been on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leaders and modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling he they dug\nPlain and simple he is eight Doug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of their lives he has a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social unrest is about to hit the street if you want to see the place for the next uh Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia the the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised\nRight all so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug\nYou can't I mean it's like Russia really either bright groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part ... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man that maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible for a while\nMay be doubtful here's the problem we are ... we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should it be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and there are probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but ah it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate\nHave at it yeah and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's businesses amen stay out of their business kind of like a production yeah\nSo I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame of very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beach they did this no

composure a and I don't care how you feel about the president\nI think enough is enough with Melania Trump\nYeah I mean I don't see her I'm\nIn a position where she's being vilified on a daily basis by the prospect sniping her for a long time I'm very charming woman a very intelligent um loves children\nUm I think she's done a very good job as first lady and there's really no reason to disparage malaria Trump\nKnow it it it my breaking point was last week when she was over in Egypt and she was over in Africa yeah and the the photos coming back of her were beautiful I mean it was a Ralph Lauren photo spread and all the press could do was if\nThey published any of those photos or they just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap Romeo I Know uh and then I\nAnd here she is where the hang on the most beautiful woman in the oval office with the with the greatest style since Jackie O. they\nLoved Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine but no fashion magazine we'll put millennia Trump on\nYou know of course she couldn't go out\nTo their cocktail parties and all that it it it there you do your commentary on the political correct ... percent but back in ... you left out some really big thing is could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I played the media hitting at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the size which came out on Tuesday\nAnd in that promotion I'm basically saying\nThat we in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil and I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that are tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they said that they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nBecause she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not the siding with her\nWho's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters within a half an hour says I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't\nNever\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened at Kanye West my favorite guy of all time\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I ... I I didn't really need them I was in an elevator with him at Madison Square garden more than ... short pants on him he was brooding right okay\nSo he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings that's why they do it\nAll right so ... goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live okay fine\nUm then because of that Trump invites them to the oval office work on your walks in with the hat and and does little motto with the president or whatever they\nDid ... okay now why isn't anyone care\n[laughter] thank you for sale CNN his whole day yeah I Know he's talking about what he was the guy\nKanye West right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump\nAll right and she's told everybody in Tennessee how to get them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back the answer is\nNo I don't and no one else does either this is a tremendous example\nOf political correctness that tiny tiny it was just going against the PC so he must be vilified\nSo I Want to go I wanted to I Want to come back 'cause you I Need to you maybe you should get a cup of coffee in or something I Need you to\nGet a little a little more animated here built a but when we when we come back I Want to ask you about cars you follow ratings\nThe ratings are falling apart let's look at the numbers of you know from like Beto\nUh and and others that are running in the Senate the numbers seem to be falling apart I think that there is a change of foot and the Democrats don't see it and when they get their head handed to them\nOr by the people I think

is going to be dragged through the mud for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day\nUh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we're celebrating the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations new start pending I drink on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang it was a young man on the other side of the phone saying Mr bowling call\nHer son call Eric right away so what's wrong he's just cleric right away I called over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying and for some reason I just went right to um is he alive\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] she said no [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] that that was a that was a rough day the next state\nWent to Colorado [noise] and uh the president called me as anything we can do for you I said no thank you [noise]\nBut at that day and realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to to create awareness round a opioids\nAmerican bought his antics on campus\nIn ways with ... ... ... so yeah so that was that there\nAre ... and so now we are a year and two days after that\nAnd it's been Roscoe\nYou we can stop at any time if you don't want to talk about anything so um but I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive\nWhy we're there indications or was it just a bad feeling feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and it's told the call your son right away without explaining why and I had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nOut he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with fat and all that wasn't the prescriptive antics he didn't know he he passed it was an accidental overdose [noise] um so the question you\nThat was going to sue ... at that moment I had no flight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent the wife and I just got very close we spent the better part of next year just talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could to get the word out that it's an epidemic\nExcuse me and uh and\nUh people parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a massive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one token kill you and not sure what you're taking\nThe parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlanta to be exposed to the ... potentially dying from an overdose it's a very\nEmotional and I think important um interview\nThere\nThere are places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think ...\nUm and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody\nNo matter what side you're on the opioid thing I mean I I um I got an emotional whole yesterday from somebody on the TV show that said thank you for speaking up for opioids because there are those of us who\nWe cannot live without them we can't pay for this woman said because of her disease she can't even sit up in bed and she's bed ridden without the opioid there are you know\nAll of these things they're double edged swords they're they're good when they're used properly and they are\nDeadly when they are abused and uh it's up to each of us uh to to know what we're dealing with and they are definitely um that podcast also goes into his relationship with the president in what he\nUnderstands a our founding and the founding principles so we wanted somebody with some a real uh meat on the bones\nAnd a guy who I have really grown to love but he already had another job or is Steve days\nSteve works for see our TV uh but we have convinced the our TV too also kind of it's kind of like a Warner Brothers and ah you know the old uh paramount studios deal\nWhere we're like okay well you can use our star for this movie and we've convince them to ah let us use Steve\nTo uh do a program immediately after this and welcome to the program now Steve days how are you\nI'm doing well get to see guys that were really really excited about this starts on Monday\nYeah start talking about it he's still going to be on see our TV's still gonna be doing it see our TV thing but he's doing a two hours of for us everyday tell if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] now that are just moving in with\nPat when you say the second best well here's the they have had its he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number\nTwo [laughter] how moving that I understand why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do\nYou know I we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve or the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\nBecause we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time because we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory uh of of ... the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs that our neighbor over there and we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nOr you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend ... and I'm perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I had a doctor or a diver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had David Reuben who else a student here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress areas\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy of somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you a little league game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between that liberal and the left is that you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nLondon is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God's says or immoral and dumb than us Eric Harris and likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are the outside our side of\nThe Haiti arena I agree that there are you know I see people\nPeople think that I Want to have conversations\nWith you know I Want to you you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't talk radio she has no interest in she has no interest he wants to end you want to share a country with the best it's the best thing is\nIs that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them\nBill so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen cheer pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd wrote the way it happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people that they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has it gotten away of everything a funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screen I don't watch any cable news at all or whether I Can't I Can't and\n... do you watch it never was except when I'm On the year that yeah yeah for India it unless it's ... hang on just a second I Want the audience to know\nThat's unheard of in our business ... that you could not have done is ... without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence idea too long form it's just toxic ingestion and that the vast yeah yeah my mom watches a lot more of this you actually like your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away while I'm and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is find my ... year\nThinks that Medicare for all is okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fight we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with that ...\nSo I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help\nAnd so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like were communists right and so we have we have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual\nMarxist communists that are that are trying to say and of capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in fulltime a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I've worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement rather than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers the GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this is filtered down and do the talking points we and conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believes America wants a wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and get more at the same time it's actually totally and reverse the majority of ... and it was fascinating is Putin a huge study on this\nBreaking it down into twenty sixteen electorate the libertarian the myth of the libertarian voter minutes how they define them that voter largely does not exist is a unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to here the party of big business who wants to lay me off and doesn't care about me guys tend to one at minimum it's not even close and then the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election and the irony is that the ultimate he missed\nAbsolutely embraces all of these cultural flashpoints he didn't say he didn't give you the token I'm pro life he stood up in front of a hundred million people at the presidential debate and said I'm going to appoint justices that will overturn roe [laughter] okay\nHurry the offer ends this Friday\nTonight ten nine central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady the interview ten women in the me too movement call you a supporter of no question this is off limits you're not the first first lady to have to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity has just put a strain on your marriage\nTonight what will Milan either Trump say let's talk about the jacket\nJak why did you wear being Milan the ABC\nExclusive event don't miss it tonight at ten nine central on ABC [noise]\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with Steve days pat gray a stew steeper gear or executive producer and of course my charming self\nUm we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video of somebody actually kicking a protester ... um we have ever called her saying a kick 'em when they're down\nIs is that is this the\nAh is this the beginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\n... ah um I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with the any sensibility left in them or are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've\nYou know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a goal but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with disability thing\nThat they're completely uh issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change those say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the right that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't good to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nI and we're we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore I think we're ... if\nYou get the referenced I'm making here so okay let's let's pick it up there\nHow do we um how do we come come back and ah how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have\nMuch more in common with us because they do believe in the bill of rights even though the people in Washington may non ...\n... I'm Chris posture there been thousands of calls about missing people in Florida since hurricane Michael it's unclear how many people might actually be missing or dead is eleven people died in the storm for sure that we know about from Florida to Virginia\nResidents who left and are coming back or who stayed are sharing what they've seen and what they couldn't believe happened to their homes\nHad been broken off the foundation and was floating around some of\nThe utilities along the Florida Panhandle say fixing the power grid itself could take weeks\nSucks is Evan brown an American pastor a health for two years in Turkey's been convicted of a terror is in charge and then let go today South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham had visited pastor Andrew Brunson in Turkey and tells box this\nIs a great day and it may be starts a new beginning what the\nUs turkey relationship\nPastor Brunson was accused of an denied supporting an unsuccessful cruel to Turkish government this is Fox News [noise]\nFifty\n[laughter]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nGlad that probably [noise] so I talked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh and I and I asked the group\nIt\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they didn't hide God three times and their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm and you are you're seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of mole lock people don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but\nThere we are repeating the Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nOn the table at the moment is or a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you're right\nBut I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative ... and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our ... that had decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is a this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removes the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't\nIt's the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and the kings seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan said this guy say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes you're wearing ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor\nYou're you're attacking their idol this is not near political disagreement this isn't even just a fundamental existential philosophical disagreement vicious religious fervor you're dealing with the loose it sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation I only understood about ten\n[laughter] pass them as short races\nSo then translate that into human language [laughter] uh I I I think we see that\nWith global warming with a with their reaction to abortion was loose Robie weight thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the eye of ... is\nThis is pale this his yeah they\nIf they don't necessarily know they don't know but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permit skewer sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the groves in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period whom himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that with the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange Dutch truth for a lie so there's one big macro truth in in the universe", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year":
